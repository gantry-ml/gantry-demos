2022-04-13 00:23:09+00:00,true,1,"  Heather / Jeff:  Thanks for a copy of the draft PPA. I've addressed this to both of you as  some of my questions are based on the interaction of the PPA vs. development  timeline and risk. Here are my thoughts / comments:  1. The PPA is really a free option through Nov. 30th, at which time we can  choose to exercise our position and proceed. How does this fit with our  expectations regarding PUC approval of our CPCN (which seems to be our  highest risk development item)? Have we gone back and submitted a  modification to our CPCN for the 2- LM6000, and 1- SW501D5A config?   2. Do we need to define the Facility as ""dual"" fuel? It will not initially be  dual fuelled as we intend to field engineer the dual fuel capability.  3. Section 3.1 (c). This provision should acknowledge our right to sell base  Contract Capacity (as opposed to excess) to any Person to the extent that  VEPCO has not exercised their option to purchase such Contract Capacity. In  other words, this section should be consistent with sales allowances to other  Persons in Section 3.4 (b) (although that section only references energy  sales).  4. Section 3.4. Can we sell both day ahead energy and capacity to any Person  to the extent VEPCO does not exercise their call by providing us the notice  contemplated in Section 3.4 (b) (the section only references an allowance for  energy sales)?  5. Section 3.4(c) Do the ""additional costs"" which this section requires Buyer  to pay (to the extent Buyer provides an intra-day notice) include  ""lost-profit"" costs arising from sales of energy and capacity by Seller to  other Persons as permitted in Section 3.4 (b)? If so, I would suggest that  this section make a specific reference, such as ""including any and all of  Seller's lost-profit and transaction costs associated with energy and  capacity sales to other Persons"".  6. Do we have a project LLC formed which can serve as the entity signing the  PPA? Do we think VEPCO will ask for any corp. or ENA guarantees to the extent  we use an LLC?   7. Have we worked with the accountants to make sure we can use MTM  accounting given the terms of this PPA?    Jeff: Please provide a brief development summary to the group outlining (in  order of highest risk to lowest) the various significant development items  we'll need to deal with for this site (i.e. zoning, groundwater supply vs.  municipal water supply, etc.). It would be helpful if you would use the  project development control matrix.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Regards,  Ben","Heather / Jeff: Thanks for a copy of the draft PPA.

2022-04-13 00:17:11+00:00,true,1,"  There would seem to me to be two questions--the threshold one is whether the site is within Rocky Mount's service territory.  If it is, then what obligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a delivery point.  I haven't reviewed the annexation statutes yet, but based on my initial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mount and NCNG, once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount's purview to serve, and, although a ""mutually agreeable"" delivery point would have to be negotiated, NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith.  The January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount the right to distribute natural gas within the city's incorporated limits as well as a specified area outside the incorporated limits.   The contract goes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed into the city, ""the respective rights of the parties as to service in any such portion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutes of North Carolina. . .""  The contract further provides that absent an order of the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right to serve all end users within the ""aforementioned"" area--presumably referring to the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity.  So, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount's right to serve arguably tracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be.  (Jonathan and I are looking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there).  The 1992 Service agreement provides, In Article IV, provides that points of devliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreement with NCNG shall be ""at the following locations and other stations added at mutually agreeable locations in the future. . ."" In the Third Amendment to the Natural Gas Service Agreement, dated March 10, 1997, new language and delivery points are negotiated upon, but the principle is still included that  other stations may be added at ""mutually agreeable locations in the future.""  The question which then arises is what Rocky Mount would have to give in exchange.  In the 1997 agreement, Rocky Mount agreed to an extention of terms of the of ten years, until December 6, ","There would seem to me two questions: the threshold one is whether the site is within Rocky Mount's service territory.

2022-04-13 00:21:20+00:00,true,1,"  Here are my comments after reviewing the below change order: (i) the cover  page refers to an enron 2-99 deal which does not correspond to the cover page  of the executed turbine purchase contract with GE.  To what does this refer  if a different deal and if the same deal, please conform.  (ii) the effective  date is stated as March 6, 2000.  Given that the agreement between Enron and  WestLB and the purchase agreement between WestLB and GE weren't signed until  May 12, 2000, if any backdating is needed (I'd like to understand why it is  for new equipment orders), it can't be before May 12th.  With respect to the  effective date and the overall placement of the order, has this $4.65MM  acquisition been dashed?  The current effective dash only contemplated the  turbines, not any ancillary equipment.  I believe Chip Schneider is the RAC  contact for this transaction.

2022-04-13 09:56:29+00:00,true,2,"  Steve,  as we have discussed,  I want to develop a model that can be used to  determine the actual value of storage by looking at deals done in the past.   In doing this, I need the model to be able to pull historical curves from  Oracle by basis location.  It will need to pull Interest Rate, Gas Daily,  Balance of the month (Swing Swap), Nymex and Basis.  Once all of the pricing curves are pulled, the model will make daily  decisions based on price relative to each other to buy, sell or hold.

Agree.   Seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.   Here are the issues I see:  Indemnity issues: They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors.  Kay  - Is your comment in connection with GE's comment to Section 27.1(iii) (carve  out of the 100% LOL for ""gross acts"" of its subcontractors, vendors, ect.)?   GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely and totally  responsible for the actions and liabilities for its subcontractors and  vendors.  I think Section 20.2(a) as written covers simple negligence of GE's  subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that we need to keep Section  27.1(iii) as written dealing with gross negligence of GE's subcontractors and  vendors.  Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence.   Agree - Maybe we could agree to GE's strike out in 20.2(a) provided the  phrase ""negligent or willfully wrongful"" is replaced with ""negligent, at  fault or strictly liable without fault"" (or some variation thereof). What is a cognizant government?  Don't know!  This was not discussed with  MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term.  We need to  also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails  to comply with law, and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty, is  ordered to shut down the facility.  Limit of liability issues: They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws,  patent infringement, liability for haz. waste and liens to 100% of purchase  price.   They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible.   Agree - See 1st comment above re indemnity.  They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another party's  claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).  Agree.  We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.  Agree.  Comments?  I suggest we get together before our next scheduled conf. call to  discuss our game plan.

Sheila Tweed advised me you were the proper  person to be looking at this matter for governmental affairs. I went ahead  and yesterday did a markup of the requested conflicts waiver from Murtha  Cullina to keep the ball moving and distributed that markkup internally via  the attachment, but nothing more has happened since then. The revised waiver  letter appended to the attachment is marked to show changes to the original  Murtha request, so I won't forward that document to you unless you want it.

Candidly, I  don't see how Murtha can continue to represent us in lobbying for the subject  transactions and represent CRRA in lobbying and legal representation for the  same transactions without conflicts or creating the appearance of  impropriety, and the markup reflects that scepticism by trying to segregate  out the representation cleanly. Also, to the extent the original draft  indicated Murtha had represented both CRRA and Enron re the transactions  until now, we need to make sure that we are OK with waiving that conflict as  a substantive matter. I'm not familiar enough with the representation to know  if Enron's interests could have been compromised during that period of dual  representation, and I do not think we should agree to the waiver until we are  comfortable on that score.The letter also now  makes clear that Murtha will  not be able to represent either party or their affiliates in litigation  involving them. Since the letter requires the signature of Enron Corp., I'm  trying to find out what clearance is required, as I customarily do not review  or initial Corp. documents for signature.

Don't know how it's used here, suggest you decline andmake them clarify.  LOL ISSUES: 1. I suppose that this is a NY law contract. I  do not think you can effectively limit your liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct in NY. Regardless of choice of law, we generally cannot get this limited or excluded in contracts with owners, either.  I think you should not accept any GE attempt to limit this by means of the cap on liability or otherwise , and should avoid muddying the water on the point by taking any ""to the fullest extent permitted by law"" clause or other  such stuff as a compromise. It will be important every time we wrap the GE equipment.  2. Generally, I do not think they should be able to limit their indemnity for Haz Mat, patents, etc.  3. They have consistently refused to clarify that the indemnity  for all third party losses includes third party consequentials when Brian or whoever else over here has been the lead negotiator with GE in the past.

Agree. Seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond. Here are the issues I see:  Indemnity issues: They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors. Kay - Is your comment in connection with GE's comment to Section 27.1(iii) (carve out of the 100% LOL for ""gross acts"" of its subcontractors, vendors, ect.)?  GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely and totally responsible for the actions and liabilities for its subcontractors and vendors.  I think Section 20.2(a) as written covers simple negligence of GE's subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that we need to keep Section 27.1(iii) as written dealing with gross negligence of GE's subcontractors and vendors. Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence. Agree - Maybe we could agree to GE's strike out in 20.2(a) provided the phrase ""negligent or willfully wrongful"" is replaced with ""negligent, at fault or strictly liable without fault"" (or some variation thereof). What is a cognizant government?  Don't know!  This was not discussed with MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term.  We need to also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails to comply with law, and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty, is ordered to shut down the facility.  Limit of liability issues: They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws, patent infringement, liability for haz. waste and liens to 100% of purchase price. They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible. Agree - See 1st comment above re indemnity. They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another party's claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).  Agree.  We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.  Agree.  Comments?  I suggest we get together before our next scheduled conf. call to discuss our game plan.  Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100 Central if 1100 doesn't work.  Is this a problem?  Works for me...just let me know when, where, ect.

2022-04-13 10:44:20+00:00,true,2,"  ** PRIVATE **  Comments:  1.  The Schedule refers to these listed contracts ""as each may be amended,  revised or modified from time to time.""  In our negotiations, we had talked  about whether we would be able to modify these without the other party's  consent and (I believe) decided that we shouldn't be allowed.  Since this is  a ""kings under bridges"" point [""The Law, in its majestic equality, forbids  the rich, as well as the poor, to sleep under the bridges, to beg in the  streets, and to steal bread."" -- Anatole France], I defer to your commercial  judgment as to whether Enron would be better served with or without a mutual  right of review for amendments, extensions, etc.  2.  As for the disclaimer language, I propose:  The inclusion of any contract listed below on this schedule is not, nor shall  it be deemed to be, an admission that the execution or performance of that  contract would constitute an EMW Restricted Activity.  3.  I'd change,  ""Agreements, . . . that Enron MW, LLC and EMW Restricted Affiliates may,  pursuant to Section 6.7.2(d) of the Agreement, perform without violating  Section 6.7.2 of the Agreement,""  to  ""Agreements, . . . that Enron MW, LLC and EMW Restricted Affiliates may,  pursuant to section (c) of the definition of EMW Permitted Activities in the  Agreement, perform without violating Section 6.7.2 of the Agreement.""  4.  Peoples' list of contracts is extensive and somewhat cryptic.  I never  understood that we were automatically agreeing that the arrangements they had  in place (whatever they may be) would be deemed approved, without question or  effect on our transaction.  It seems to me that commercial due diligence is  required to ascertain whether grandfathering these arrangements -- without  any participation or profit-sharing by the Hub -- is appropriate. We ought  also to have some mechanism to ensure that the scope of these arrangements is  not expanded.  Do you agree?  I look forward to discussing this with you.  DT  >>> <Gregg.Penman@enron.com> 08/24/00 10:56AM >>> Hello - attached are copies of Schedule A (Enron MW) and Schedule B (Peoples MW) to the MEH LLC Agreement.  Peoples has included a few projects they are working on that don't have existing agreements.  Enron's list is much shorter, 3 agreements to be exact.  The third agreement is a storage deal with Nicor that would technically be a permitted activity under the trading exclusion.  However, I believe we decided to include it, but we need to also include the disclaimer language that inclusion on the Schedule does not imply a restricted activity.  I have asked Hunter Shively, Central Desk Director, if he knows of any other ""middle-market"" deals that we should include and he said no.  I have also had our back office run the counterparties through our trading systems to identify any term transactions that may currently be in place.  Other than the Nicor deal listed, there were only standard trading buy/sells with Nicor in the system.  Which brings up my last point, do we need to disclose the existence of Master Purchase Agreements with a Covered Gas Utility? Trading uses these Agreements for standard physical buy/sells.  Anything more complicated would be done under a separate agreement.  The Nicor deal was done under a separate agreement, not the existing Master.  If my vote counts, I say let's not include them.

If you are not the intended recipient, please do not read, copy, use or disclose this communication to others; also please notify the sender by replying to this message, and then delete it from your system. Thank you. _______________________________________________________________  David: Here are my comments re the Agency Agreement draft sent last week: (1) Section 1.27. I would suggest replacing ""in Peoples' sole discretion"" with ""in accordance with Sections 6.1 and 6.2"". This is more consistent with the intent re changes to the Operating Statement. (2) Section 2.4. Each one of the new provisions re nominations, (a) 1,2, and 3, ends with a similar sentence: ""Peoples will confirm these requests as soon as practicable prior to such nimination deadline and shall enter any nominations necessary by such nomination deadline."" Should this be more specific, perhaps something like : ""Peoples will confirm acceptance of these requests as soon as practicable prior to the nomination deadlione and shall schedule such nominations prior to the dealdine.""? (The wording for no. 3 is similar to 1 and 2.)   (3) Section 2.9 (ii) From a regulatory perspective, I prefer the bracketed language. As I noted regarding the last draft, a regulator would be concerned with an agreement commiting only to ""commercially reasonable efforts"" re compliance with the GTC, or a Law or Judgment. (4) Section 2.10. There is a typo in the second line from the bottom of 8, it's ""remains"" unpaid, not ""remain"". (note that this concept of a Peoples credit policy is consistent with Peoples' rights re denial of serivice under Section 8.2 of the GTC, which allows Peoples to refuse service based on a credit analysis.) (5) Section 5.1. At the time of the last draft, we discussed an additional representation for Peoples that ""it has provided MEH with a copy of the G&TC in effect as of the Effective Date"". This could inserted in 5.1 as (d), with a relettering of current d and e. (6) Section 7.2 I don't think the second to last sentence will work. This says that, if Peoples rejects an offered Extended Hub Transactions or doesn't timely accept, it can't enter into a similar transaction with the party involved for 6 months. The problem with this is that Peoples must provided Hub Service under the GTC, except when a ground for refusal stated in Section 8.2 of the GTC applies. The circumstances described in 7.2 are not a legitimate ground for refusal. I beleive, however, that we get to the same place if 7.2 were modified to require that Peoples pay MEH its percentage of Cumulative Net Revenues in the event that a transaction similar to one previously rejected for the same party is accepted within 6 mos. after termination of the Agency Agreement.  (7) Section 8.3.  Item (vi) of the list of functions could be expanded to state: ""assisting in the pareparation and filing of requests for Governmental Approval in accordance with Section 10.1 and/or the preparation of FERC reports that are required in the ordinary course of business and not specifically requested by FERC."" I wan't sure of the intent re the last phrase of this. Does this mean that if a Report is specifically requested by FERC, MEH would be paid separetly for work on the Report? I would have thought that routine review of regulatory filings and work on reports might all fall into the category covered by the $50,000 payment, regardless of whether a particular report is requested.

In looking at Section 22.2 (iv) it is our opinion that assignment ""to any other party"" is too broad for GE to accept.  What we would like to propose is to continue with the concept of assignment without consent for a well defined list of areas that Enron believes it will do business.  Anything outside of this defined list would require GE's consent.

2022-04-13 19:54:20+00:00,true,2,"  Ben,  Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.   One issue is when this transaction can close.

If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle  back with Lisa.  A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both  ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for  payment for changes, storage, etc.  As far as I know, this concept hasn't  been addressed with GE.

2022-04-13 02:38:02+00:00,true,2,"  Gentlemen,  I thought I would pull together a brief email outlining where we are on  certain tasks.  Here goes:  Hub Agency Agreement - Gregg recently met with Peoples to discuss some of the  outstanding commercial issues relating to the Hub Agency Agreement.  Roy is  putting together a summary of the outcome of that meeting.  Gregg and I  decided it would be better to not send Peoples the current draft of the  agreement which has been circulated internally, but instead will send a draft  which incorporates the outcome of these discussions.  Memo regarding restricted activities - David has prepared a draft for Enron's  review.  Here's the draft:  Gregg and I need to review it.  Gregg and Peoples have been working on the grandfathered transaction list.   Since both sides are running behind on this,  David prepared a very straight  forward amenment to the LLC agreement, exending the time frame for finishing  the task.  Here it is:    Policies - Gregg ""Policy Man"" Penman has been working on a credit policy,  cash management policy, risk management policy, and probably a couple of  others I'm forgetting.  Revolving line of credit - Gregg has been working the internal Enron system  to get approval for a $50mm line of credit for MEH.  He has raised the issue  of Peoples needing to provide a guarantee for their half.  Also, it may be  necessary or advisable to document that the line of credit will be paid  before any distributions are made to either member.  This is still under  internal review at Enron.  I will check around to see if Corp (the lender)  has a form of credit facility we should use.  Miscellaneous: Decide about services agreement Confidentiality agreements  Transfer pricing documentation Other agreements (ISDA, GISB, Peaking Agency, Third Party Master) Board resolution appointing officers/managers Budget and marketing plan  Other administrative functions (per Gregg's Business Setup Items list)  Hope this is helpful.

2022-04-13 01:33:57+00:00,true,2,"   Attached is a copy of the VEPCO Interconnection Agreement on which I have  made certain changes and included comments in bracketed notes.  (Most of the  notes could be included in a mark-up sent back to VEPCO; there is one marked  ""Note to Enron"" that is intended to be deleted before we send this out.)  The Agreement, as might be expected, is very  one-sided and is written  primarily for their protection.  It is also very repetitive in places,  although I did not attempt to eliminate the repetition on the theory that the  fewer changes we propose the better and we can probably live with the  repetition.  There are several provisions or concepts I would like to suggest  we include from the form I had prepared a couple of weeks ago (which was  based on the EPSA model form, and was clearly more favorable to the  generation owner than VEPCO's form.)  I have not yet included these changes,  as I thought we should discuss them first and decide how best to proceed on  this draft.  Those provisions are as follows (section references are to the  draft I prepared):  2.43.  Right to tell VEPCO to suspend or terminate work on interconnection  facilities.  2.4.4  Requirement for Vepco to provide status reports on progress of  construction of interconnection facilities.  2.5.2 (maybe)  Agreement to start work on facilities before all studies  complete, if generator owner willing to bear risk of extra costs.  2.7.1 Undertaking by Vepco to use reasonable efforts to complete on schedule  (actually, if 4.2.2 is used, this section probably should not be used.)  3.11.3 (last sentence)  Vepco liable for costs for modifications to  generator-owned interconnection facilities and the Facility if changes  required because of changes to Vepco facilities (unless required by law).  4.1 Vepco must inform generator owner if costs exceed estimate by more than  10% and such increase is subject to generator owner's consent.  4.2.2 Concept that Vepco must seek bids for the work and generator owner can  choose whether the work is done with best efforts undertaking to complete on  time, but no penalties/incentives or with firm completion date and  penalties/incentives.  4.3  Generator owner to provide letter of credit for cost of work or  guarantee (as opposed to 50% paid in advance, as provided in Vepco's draft.   By the way, even if we agreed to pay 50% in advance, it should not be on  signing the agreement, but rather before they start the work.)  4.8.1  Refund if Vepco receives money back.  4.9.1  Language re tax gross up (in lieu of the last sentence in their  Section 7.3.)  5.1  Last sentence--add generator owner's schedules and output,etc. being  confidential.   In addition, there were a few things in the draft I wanted to point out, as  follows:  In Section 2.2.3 and elsewhere in the agreement, they reserve the right to  make a unilateral filing with FERC to amend the agreement.  The generator  owner would have the right to protest the filing, but I want to check with  our regulatory people as to whether they can waive this right, as I don't  think it's fair for them to unilaterally amend it.  Article 4.6 should be reviewed by technical folks.  In Section 10.2.1.3, they reserve the right to file the agreement with FERC  even if the parties haven't agreed and executed it yet and they start service  under the agreement.  As noted above, it's putting your fate in FERC's hands.  The indemnity of Vepco's employees and waiver of the protection of worker's  comp laws in Section 10.5.1 (and the reciprocal in 10.5.2) seemed strange to  me and I was wondering if you could run this past your risk management people.  I look forward to discussing this with you further.    - 1155119.doc","4.5.3 Amendments to the VEPCO Interconnection Agreement. I have made certain changes and included comments in bracketed notes.

2022-04-13 22:21:11+00:00,true,2,"  Team Enron -  I spoke with Lisa this morning regarding her comments to the GE  language, the substance of which follows. I  can discuss this on the call  with GE, but I wanted the Enron participants to know what our issues are.    1) Assignment  - Generally, if GE is going to require that we list all the  possible assignees, the list should be broad enough to encompass the  possibilities.  The comments below are designed to help make the language as  broad and flexible as possible.  It would be best if we did not have to list  them.   A. 22.2(iii) and (iv) -  we need to make sure that the definition of   ""Facility"" will be generic enough to cover any facility, not merely the  one(s) which may be the subject of the particular agreement - also generally  we will need to vet any defined term used in our sections to make sure it  does not result in greater restriction than we planned ;   B. I think we can remove the bracket before 22.2 (iii)(2) and add  ""Purchaser"" to the list of folks who can agree to ""convey a power plant  project.""  Also in that clause, we will need to confirm required ""timing"" of  some power plant project development - does it mean only at the time of  signing the agreement?  It should be for any power plant project in  development either at the time of signing the agreement, or any project in  development in the future.   Insert the number 3 before the last ""and"" in  22.2(iii);   C. The paragraph following 22.2(iv)(c) has references to ""(v) and (vi)""  above, which are no longer in the list;    D. The bold and bracketed language indicates that the terms of each of the  ""Facility Agreements"" should be in ""strict conformity"" with the Ts and Cs of  ""this Agreement.""   Although it is written in the context that there has been  an assignment, Lisa wants to make sure that there is no expectation on GE's  part that an Enron entity will necessarily remain as the ""Agent.""  Also, the  language indicates that the assignee and the vendor will enter into an  indemnity provision in the Facility Agreement that is in accordance with  Exhibit E  (last sentence).  Does this still work given that the indemnity  now runs only to the Purchaser?    2) Limitation of Liability - 27.2 and 27.3  We may need to explain to the  Enron accountants and AA that the reference to ""indemnity"" in these sections  does not create a separate indemnity obligation on Enron's or WLB's part.     3) Is the phrase ""cognizant government"" in 20.2(b) meant to apply to a  governing body with jurisdiction over the Seller and/or Purchaser?

Scott, please drop by and brief me on these.  Cognizant Gov't? Never heard of  the term, and itis not one of the usual defined terms. Don't know how it's used here, suggest you decline andmake them clarify.  LOL ISSUES: 1. I suppose that this is a NY law contract. I  do not think you can effectively limit your liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct in NY. Regardless of choice of law, we generally cannot get this limited or excluded in contracts with owners, either.  I think you should not accept any GE attempt to limit this by means of the cap on liability or otherwise , and should avoid muddying the water on the point by taking any ""to the fullest extent permitted by law"" clause or other  such stuff as a compromise. It will be important every time we wrap the GE equipment.  2. Generally, I do not think they should be able to limit their indemnity for Haz Mat, patents, etc.  3. They have consistently refused to clarify that the indemnity  for all third party losses includes third party consequentials when Brian or whoever else over here has been the lead negotiator with GE in the past. I would like to think that we could get it clarified now that the larger Enron is working it.  Please try it again if you can.

Agree. Seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond. Here are the issues I see:  Indemnity issues: They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors. Kay - Is your comment in connection with GE's comment to Section 27.1(iii) (carve out of the 100% LOL for ""gross acts"" of its subcontractors, vendors, ect.)?  GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely and totally responsible for the actions and liabilities for its subcontractors and vendors.  I think Section 20.2(a) as written covers simple negligence of GE's subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that we need to keep Section 27.1(iii) as written dealing with gross negligence of GE's subcontractors and vendors. Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence. Agree - Maybe we could agree to GE's strike out in 20.2(a) provided the phrase ""negligent or willfully wrongful"" is replaced with ""negligent, at fault or strictly liable without fault"" (or some variation thereof). What is a cognizant government?  Don't know!  This was not discussed with MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term.  We need to also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails to comply with law, and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty, is ordered to shut down the facility.  Limit of liability issues: They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws, patent infringement, liability for haz. waste and liens to 100% of purchase price. They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible. Agree - See 1st comment above re indemnity. They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another party's claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).  Agree.  We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.  Agree.  Comments?  I suggest we get together before our next scheduled conf. call to discuss our game plan.  Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100 Central if 1100 doesn't work.  Is this a problem?  Works for me...just let me know when, where, ect.

My somewhat knee-jerk reaction has been that  NEPCo is, indeed, taking a very aggressive approach.  We are also hearing  that they are under some sort of ""mandate"" to include these provisions in  their contracts on a going forward basis (I think I might have some idea of  what that's about), but we are obviously concerned that it won't fly with a  third party buyer of our project.  Dean, Jim Fowler (our outside counsel at  McCutchen) and I may want to chat about it with you further.  On a related note, I keep running into the need to have a more basic  understanding of the West LB documents and the GE LM-6000 contract than I  have.  Do you have copies of those documents, and could I ask you to have  copies made and sent to me?  Much appreciated.  Hope all is well, Karen     To: Dean Russell/SF/ECT@ECT cc: Karen E Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sheila Tweed/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: EPC Limits of Liability    NEPCO's position sounds more typical for a cost plus contract.  Is this a  lump sum deal? If so, then I think NEPCO is taking an aggressive approach to  both LOL and retention.  A 10% limit of liability during the warranty period  is particularly aggressive, unless there are a lot of carve outs to the limit  of liability, and other give-and-takes which make it make sense. Another  factor which might make a difference is the treatment given to the GE  contract.  Is NEPCO taking risk on GE performance, and is the dollar value of  the GE equipment included in the price used to figure the % of liability?  I'm glad to discuss this if I can be of help.

ENA/SF is in the middle of negotiating the EPC contract for Pastoria (750 MW)  with NEPCO.  We have hit a couple of snags in the contract and would very  much appreciate your input as to what is ""market.""   1. Limit of Liability -  NEPCO would like 80% up to Substantial Completion,  40% up to Final Acceptance, and 10% for the Warranty Period.  GE's LOL is  100% of their contract value though the warranty period. (which Kiewit also  agreed to on Pittsburg.) 2. Retention - NEPCO would like to have 10% retention on payments only for  the first 5% on the contract value and then 5% retention thereafter.  We  would prefer 10% throughout the payment schedule.  What do you think?  We want the Owner's position to be as strong as possible  to enhance the sale of the project, but NEPCO is under a great amount of  pressure to reduce their contingent liability, and we really don't want to  leave them holding the bag once we are gone if it is not necessary.

Hopefully, since we are only talking about a high pressure tap, NCNG will have less leverage.  Jeffrey and I did talk about amending the application some time ago;  he expressed the concern that the description of the generators might be misleading unless either more or less data were supplied, and he suggested describing them more generally.  I think he was confortable with the fact that the CPCN will be reviewed by electrical engineers who understand the generators described without the elaboration he thought necessary.  One of the problems with amending the application is that you run the risk that the Commission will adjust the time frames for intervention, etc., accordingly.  If you want to revise the description of the equipment, it would be less dangerous to file a project update.     ","Allyson, Thank you for your prompt response.

If it is, then what obligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a delivery point.  I haven't reviewed the annexation statutes yet, but based on my initial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mount and NCNG, once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount's purview to serve, and, although a ""mutually agreeable"" delivery point would have to be negotiated, NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith.    The January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount the right to distribute natural gas within the city's incorporated limits as well as a specified area outside the incorporated limits.   The contract goes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed into the city, ""the respective rights of the parties as to service in any such portion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutes of North Carolina. . .""  The contract further provides that absent an order of the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right to serve all end users within the ""aforementioned"" area--presumably referring to the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity.  So, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount's right to serve arguably tracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be.  (Jonathan and I are looking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there).    The 1992 Service agreement provides, In Article IV, provides that points of devliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreement with NCNG shall be ""at the following locations and other stations added at mutually agreeable locations in the future. . ."" In the Third Amendment to the Natural Gas Service Agreement, dated March 10, 1997, new language and delivery points are negotiated upon, but the principle is still included that  other stations may be added at ""mutually agreeable locations in the future.""  The question which then arises is what Rocky Mount would have to give in exchange.  In the 1997 agreement, Rocky Mount agreed to an extention of terms of the of ten years, until December 6,     ","Allyson, Thank you for the email, it seems to stop mid sentence, so I was wondering if maybe something got deleted?

2022-04-13 23:40:04+00:00,true,2,"  I am in receipt of the Fehr's comments to our option agreement.  In reviewing  them, I have the following comments:  The paragraph (2) change that says they can compel us to buy their land upon  a Triggering Event occurring is not going to work, because this is a put  option on their part which hurts our hard cost avoidance issues.  We  carefully reworded previous put option language to avoid this.    Also, how  can we be bound to a deal when the agreement has expired ?  I think we would  need to say that ""if we decide to build the plant after the option period  expires, then that would serve to extend the term of this agreement, however,  if the option agreement expires unexercised for a one year period then we  won't be bound to the deal.    If the provisions of his comment (5) are indeed parallel to another similar  paragraph in the document I don't have a problem with it, but ""specific  performance"" scares me in general.  Your (collective) call.   Lets wrap this one up fast.  I want to resolve it soon so I can use it as  leverage with Ledford and not have him influence them.  He picked a good to  go on vacation, but is back in on Monday.  I also told the Fehr's that if we  could do this before the 15th I would go for $185,000 vs. $175,000.  Since we  were about five days longer than promised, I can justify the delay to end of  next week, but I don't want them to think I was just blowing smoke on the  extra $10,000.

It largely tracks our understanding and analysis.  The following are her words:  ""To my knowledge, no one has challenged anything filed with the Commission under seal pursuant to the trade secret statute.  Under that statute, if you want the information claimed to be a trade secret, you have to go to court and carry the burden (and my recollection from reading the statute is that it is a very high burden).  The only other way it could be made public would be for the Commission to order it to be made public (because it isn't a trade secret), which to my knowledge has never happened with anything even remotely of commercial value and even then the owner of the information could go to court to stop it. Costs related to generation are the most obviously ""trade secret"" type information with which we deal. None of the utilities would try to claim it isn't protected, because then they would have to reveal their information.  CUCA could try to get it in order to participate in the hearing, but CUCA generally supports IPP development (in general), and Jamie would have to sign a nondisclosure agreement and not reveal the information to anyone.  For all practical purposes, Enron is safe.

My somewhat knee-jerk reaction has been that  NEPCo is, indeed, taking a very aggressive approach.  We are also hearing  that they are under some sort of ""mandate"" to include these provisions in  their contracts on a going forward basis (I think I might have some idea of  what that's about), but we are obviously concerned that it won't fly with a  third party buyer of our project.  Dean, Jim Fowler (our outside counsel at  McCutchen) and I may want to chat about it with you further.

Is this a  lump sum deal? If so, then I think NEPCO is taking an aggressive approach to  both LOL and retention.  A 10% limit of liability during the warranty period  is particularly aggressive, unless there are a lot of carve outs to the limit  of liability, and other give-and-takes which make it make sense. Another  factor which might make a difference is the treatment given to the GE  contract.  Is NEPCO taking risk on GE performance, and is the dollar value of  the GE equipment included in the price used to figure the % of liability?  I'm glad to discuss this if I can be of help.

We have hit a couple of snags in the contract and would very  much appreciate your input as to what is ""market.""   1. Limit of Liability -  NEPCO would like 80% up to Substantial Completion,  40% up to Final Acceptance, and 10% for the Warranty Period.  GE's LOL is  100% of their contract value though the warranty period. (which Kiewit also  agreed to on Pittsburg.) 2. Retention - NEPCO would like to have 10% retention on payments only for  the first 5% on the contract value and then 5% retention thereafter.  We  would prefer 10% throughout the payment schedule.  What do you think?  We want the Owner's position to be as strong as possible  to enhance the sale of the project, but NEPCO is under a great amount of  pressure to reduce their contingent liability, and we really don't want to  leave them holding the bag once we are gone if it is not necessary.

I tend to think NCNG would not ask.  Based on the limited statement of interest in their petition to intervene, it's hard for me to see what they could justify asking for.  Also, they always have to be careful, because more often than not, they are going to be on the receiving end of data requests.

2022-04-13 04:28:59+00:00,true,2,"  Rob made some changes in the e-mail I sent last Friday.  He put the info  about the Assignment and Assumption Agreement in para. 2 and used more  defined terms from the ADA.  I think we can use the same A&A agreement to notify WestLB of our intent to  assign the P.O. and give notice as to the closing date.  However, the current  form of A&A agreement has sig. blocks for only ENA and WestLB.  Seems like  you need a sig. for the assuming party!  Particularly since that party is  purporting to give notice to WestLB of its intent to pay the purchase price!    Rose   To effectuate the movement of turbines out of the WestLB LM6000 structures  the following needs to take place:    1) ADA - Assignment of the Purchase Option.  On at least 5 (five) days notice  to WestLB, ENA will assign the Purchase Option for the subject equipment and  ancillary agreement to the purchasing entity.  This assignment (the  ""Assignment"")  must release the Lessor (WestLB)  from all its obligations  under the Turbine Purchase Agreement with respect to the subject equipment  and ancillary agreements.  This means that GE Packaged Power (a division of  GE) and other vendors must release WestLB from its obligations with respect  to the subject equipment and contracts.  (Kay - Could this be done by an  amendment to the scheduled equipment under the various agreements between  WestLB and the various vendors? Rose - I believe so, along with entering into  the new contracts reference in 3))    The assignment agreement to effect this is explained below and can be  prepared by Kay, Rose or Rob.  2) ADA - Closing of the Purchase Option.  WestLB requires at least 5 (five)  days written notice of the exercise of the purchase option and  this notice  can be included in the Assignment and Assumption Agreement.   The purchase  price for the subject equipment and agreements will be the ""Termination  Amount"" as defined in the ADA, as allocable to the subject equipment and  contracts.  This amount is equal to the sum of i) the aggregate outstanding  amount of the Advances, plus ii) any Transaction Expenses then due and owing.  plus iii) all accrued amounts due on any Lessor Yield or Facility Fee, plus  iv) any amounts owed for any costs reasonably incurred by the Lessor with  respect to the subject equipment and contracts.  The particular amounts of  the foregoing costs and fees allocable to the subject equipment and contracts  should be determined in coordination with Lisa Bills and Humberto Cubillos.  The Assignment and Assumption Agreement  used to consummate the Purchase  Option is attached as Exhibit G to the ADA and can be prepared by Kay, Rose  or Rob.  It needs to be executed by ENA, ENA's Designee as assignee and  WestLB.  A detailed list of the equipment and contracts being assigned must  be prepared by the assignee and attached to the assignment.    3) Assignment under the Turbine Purchase Agreement.  The Purchaser (WestLB)  under the Turbine Purchase Agreement (the ""Turbine Contract"") may assign a  portion of its rights and obligations under the Turbine Contract to an  affiliate of ENA without the Seller's consent.  Kay has structured the  Turbine Contract to allow the assignee to enter into separate purchase  agreements with GE Packaged Power for the equipment being assigned.   The  documents to transfer title of the equipment from WestLB (in the case of  equipment that is already fabricated) , or to replace ENA with another  business unit on the purchase agreement (in the case of WIP turbines) should  be prepared by the business unit attorneys involved in the transfer, based on  a form of contract which is very similiar to the Master Purchase Agreement.    The tax specialists from both ENA and the acquiring business units should be  advised as to the planned date of title transfer.     Same generally holds true for the ABB transformers, except that the  assignment to an Enron SPV may require a form of security.    ",Rob made some changes in the e-mail I sent last Friday.

If you are not the intended recipient, please do not read, copy, use or disclose this communication to others; also please notify the sender by replying to this message, and then delete it from your system. Thank you. _______________________________________________________________  These are my comments re the draft Petition forwarded by Peoples on Friday: (1) The Petition describes PERC in paragraph and refers to PERC in par. 3. PERC, however, is not a party to the Master Agreement, and the Petition does not discuss request any relief with respect to PERC. I don't see why there is a need to reference PERC. (2) It is my understanding that, under the Master Agreement, there will be two types of transactions: (a) simple buy/sells at a clear market price; and (b) complex transactions with sharing arrangements, management fees and similar structures. As we have discussed, the first type of transaction, simple buy/sells at a market price fall under an exemption to Section 7-101's approval requirement (220 ILCS 5/7-101(4)). These types of transactions do  not require ICC approval and MEH/Peoples are free to engage in such transaction now. I would suggest that the Petition point this out, particularly if (as I suspect is the case) MEH and Peoples are now conducting such transactions or may wish to do so before the ICC acts on the Master Agreement. Because the Master Agreement covers certain transaction which need approval and other which do not, I would suggest that the Petition make this clear and request approval only ""to the extent required"". (This was the language used by NIGAS in seeking approval of a buy/sell agreement in Docket 95-0302.) (3) With respect to the transactions which do require approval (the complex ones with sharing arrangements, management fees and similar structures), the draft Petition doesn't say much. It says (Par. 5) that transactions under the Agreement will optimize the use of the gas supply and capacity assets of Peoples and MEH; (Par. 9) that Peoples has similar master contracts with non-affiliated entities; (par. 10) that the agreement will not interfere with Peoples' operations; and (par. 10) that the Agreement is in the best interest of Peoples and its customers. All of these statements are fine to include, but the ICC is likely to want to know more about why the agreement is in the public interest. Perhaps a sentence or two could explain how the Agreement will optimize Peoples' use of its gas supply and capacity assets (e.g., by using capacity which otherwise would be idle) and how this will benefit Peoples' Illinois ratepayers (e.g., a credit to PGA gas costs). Also, Peoples is asking that the ICC pre-approve an arrangement under which the ""details"" of individual transactions will be filled in later. As I understand it, the ""details"" will include such things as the level of management fees and other compensation terms. To facilitate approval, it would be best to have some sort of guideline to suggest to the ICC, i.e., a management fee within a certain amount or percentage of a specified index level. If there is an industry standard approach that could be referenced, that may be of use. The Petition suggests that there are other Agreements of this type with non-affiliates. Perhaps reference could be made to pricing provisions under one or more of those agreements. If it is not possible to be any more specific, I am concerned that the ICC may want to wait and review individual transaction rather than giving blanket approval without knowing more. (4) The ICC approval process can take 4-5 months (sometimes more) to complete. The required approval time, however, can be cut down significantly when the apprval filing includes a Peition and supporting testimony that lays out all the information needed to conclude that a proposed arrangement is in the public interest (the interest of Illinois ratepayers). The Petition itself need not include all the details (it need only lay out the case ingeneral terms). A filing package which, with accompanying testimony, tells the full story will expedite the approval process.

2022-04-13 22:14:45+00:00,true,2,"  Calif Pwr Woes Tuesday, September 12, 2000 08:15 AM        ?Mail this article to a friend     (This article was originally published Monday)   WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has limited  authority to address flawed electricity markets in California and alleged  price gouging by power producers, but will act to overhaul the state's  wholesale power markets if necessary, FERC Chairman James Hoecker told a  congressional panel Monday.   The commission was ready to act once the results of an expedited staff  investigation of problems affecting power markets in the U.S. West becomes  available, Hoecker said in testimony presented to a San Diego field hearing  of the House Commerce Committee's energy panel.   ""If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction,  we will do so,"" Hoecker told lawmakers. And if price gouging is occurring ""as  some have alleged,"" he added, ""we will respond accordingly, by revoking  market-based rates or otherwise.""   However, Hoecker stressed that the commission's authority is limited under  the Federal Power Act.   ""The commission has limited ability to relieve the immediate customer crisis.  Important aspects of this problem are a state responsibility, such as  authorizing construction of new generation and transmission facilities,""  Hoecker testified.   The commission can't act to limit prices charged by power providers ""until we  have a record supporting such action,"" he said, referring to the results of  the pending staff investigation.   Further, he said, the law bars FERC from ordering retroactive refunds to San  Diego Gas & Electric Co. for the power it purchased this summer to serve its  retail customer base.   Hoecker testified before the House Commerce Committee's Energy and Power  Subcommittee, which is looking into the supply shortages in California this  summer that have forced San Diego electricity consumers to pay twice as much  for power as they did a year ago.   State Mkt Structure Blamed For Crisis   The hearing comes after much wrangling at FERC, as SDG&E, a unit of Sempra  Energy (SRE, news, msgs), sought an order setting price caps for power bid  into the state-sponsored electricity exchange, and power producers sought an  order allowing cost recovery for lost opportunity sales if the state's  independent grid operator curtailed sales outside California, where price  controls don't apply.   FERC hasn't yet responded to the producers, and deferred action on SDG&E's  bid for price controls until the staff investigation is completed. But it  left in place an order allowing the independent system operator to limit the  price it pays for power, which acts as a de facto cap on prices bid into the  power exchange.   Hoecker, while withholding judgment pending the staff probe, appeared to  place much of the blame for this summer's crisis with the state-mandated  market structure, which left San Diego consumers subject to spot-market  volatility.   And he appeared to suggest that FERC's order directing utilities to transfer  transmission assets to control of large regional transmission organizations,  or RTOs, will offer an opportunity to develop a regional solution to the  power-supply problem.   FERC deferred to California in restructuring the wholesale market in  California because its experience with new market institutions such as power  exchanges and ISOs was limited, Hoecker said.   Other states, such as Pennsylvania, were ""less prescriptive than California  in telling the commission how their wholesale markets should operate,""  Hoecker noted.   Now, with FERC's Order 2000 encouraging formation of RTOs, ""the commission is  in a very different posture with respect to the structure of wholesale  markets,"" he said.   ""Large regional markets can be made to work effectively,"" Hoecker told the  lawmakers, citing the Pennsylvania restructuring as an example.   Other witnesses were more forceful in criticizing the state-mandated market  structure.   By requiring the state's three investor-owned utilities to purchase all their  electricity from the power exchange and limiting their ability to hedge price  risks by entering into long-term fixed-price contracts, the state left  consumers subject to volatility in the state-mandated spot market, said  officials with Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) and Reliant Energy (REI, news,  msgs).   California's market structure ""placed no economic incentives on the default  utility providers to look out for the costs that are ultimately passed on to  their consumers,"" Reliant's John Stout testified.   ""San Diego's experience offers the Congress an unparalleled opportunity to  learn from a bungled attempt at deregulation,"" said Michael Shames, executive  director of Utility Consumer's Action Network.   Shames and other witnesses warned the congressional committee that  California's electricity crisis is likely to occur in other regions of the  country unless steps are taken to free up interstate trade in power and allow  FERC to better police markets.   ""California is just the latest problem area in U.S. power markets and, unless  policymakers act quickly, it will not be the last,"" said Enron Corp. (ENE,  news, msgs) Steven Kean executive vice president.   ""Unless Congress and FERC are willing to address the interstate issues that  are beyond the jurisdiction of state legislators and regulators, I predict  that our experience in San Diego is indicative of what others will encounter  in trying to create a competitive electricity market,"" said Edwin Guiles,  Sempra's president of regulated operations.   ""This electricity crisis is not a California-only problem,"" said Rep. Brian  Bilbray, R-Calif., who represents San Diego and requested Monday's hearing.   ""We will continue to be in this mess if state and federal officials don't  work together to find long-term solutions to the flaws in the marketplace,""  Bilbray said.   -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires, 202-862-6647, bryan.lee@dowjones.com   Quote for referenced ticker symbols: EIX, ENE, PCG, REI, SRE    , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Connecticut courts and the Freedom of Information Commission (the ""FOIC""), the agency charged with the enforcement of FOIA, have repeatedly held that CRRA, CDA and DECD are public agencies within the purview of FOIA (I have not had time to consider whether the same is true for DEP, CPUC and the other attendees, but suspect that it is so with respect to certain of them).  FOIA provides, among other things, that all documents obtained or kept by a public agency are public records available to the public, unless otherwise exempted from disclosure by special statute or by the exemptions delineated by FOIA.  While there is no special statute with regard to CRRA, a special statute, Conn. Gen. Stat. Section 32-11a(k), exempts certain materials and information submitted to DECD and to CDA from public disclosure.  Section 32-11a(k) states that all information  contained in any application for financial assistance submitted to DECD or CDA, and all information obtained by the DECD or CDA with respect to any person or project is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.  The statute specifies that this exemption includes all financial, credit and proprietary information.  I have not had time to consider whether there are special statutory exemptions provided for similar information submitted to the other attendees.  Consequently, FOIA governs the confidentiality of all information submitted to CRRA and, perhaps, certain of the other attendees and the confidentiality of information submitted to DECD and CDA falling outside Section 32-11a(k)'s exemption.  As may be pertinent in these circumstances, FOIA exempts from disclosure: (1) preliminary drafts under certain circumstances, (2) trade secrets and commercial or financial information given in confidence, and that is not required by statute to be disclosed to an agency, (3) real estate appraisals, engineering or feasiblity estimates or evaluations for an agency relative to the acquisition of property or to prospective public supply and construction contracts, but only until such time as the property is acquired or the transaction abandoned, (4) tax returns, reports and statements exempted by federal law or state statutes, and (5) communications privileged by the attorney-client relationship.  While the Connecticut courts and FOIC have held that the confidentiality of information submitted to agencies subject to FOIA is determined by applicable law rather that the representations or agreements of the parties, they have suggested that measures designed to preserve confidentiality may be considered in making that determination.  While your notice cites a May 19, 2000 Agreement of Confidentiality previously executed by CRRA and Enron (which I have not seen), obviously that will not be binding upon any attendees not a party to it and, while it would be better to have the other attendees execute a written agreement regarding confidentiality, I understand that that may not be practical given the timing and the number of parties involved. Accordingly, I recommend that the following other steps be employed with respect to confidential information submitted to the attendees:  1.  All documents and information submitted to the attendees should be marked ""Preliminary Draft"".  2.  In the fourth paragraph of your notice, change clause (1) to read ""the Subject Information is being provided to it in confidence, contains trade secrets and/or confidential commercial, financial and proprietary information and other information exempt from disclosure under certain laws of the State of Connecticut, and it will maintain the confidentiality of the Subject Information"".  3. You should take steps, internally, to ensure the confidentiality of the information you submit to the agencies.  Appropriate measures would include: (a) limiting access to confidential information to a ""need to know"" basis, (b) entering into confidentiality agreements with others involved in the project with respect to their studies, analyses, etc., for the project, (c) advising your personnel (secretarial, etc.), in writing, that the information is confidential and of the need to maintain such information in confidence, and (d) maintaining confidential information in locked or otherwise private files.  5. A request should be made by you to the agencies that confidential information  be discussed by the agencies in executive session.  If we take these measures with regard to information supplied to the agencies, we will enhance the likelihood of maintaining the confidentiality of the information in response to a public request for disclosure of the information pursuant to the FOIA.

(ENE,  news, msgs) will continue to develop and purchase power plants, president  Jeffrey Skilling told Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday.   ""Generation assets are essential to a successful trading operation,"" Skilling  said, responding to recent trade reports that the company plans to exit the  power generation business. The Houston-based energy company is ""absolutely  not"" selling its power plants as part of its strategy, he said.   Enron will continue to build and purchase natural gas-fired ""peaking plants,""  which produce power only during times of high demand and wholesale prices,  Skilling said.   Enron has begun construction of a few such projects in the U.S. Midwest and  South, and will continue development chiefly in the U.S and Europe, he said.   ""The margins are higher (in wholesale power markets) in Europe,"" Skilling  said. ""The market there is more fractional, and that creates more  opportunities for someone who's playing across the board.""   Developments in Europe, particularly in southern Europe, also offer a higher  per-unit rate of return, Skilling said.   Nonetheless, Skilling did confirm that the company isn't interested in  building larger-sized plants in any country, and that its construction goals  may not be as lofty as those of other energy companies.   ""We are not interested in building base-load plants,"" Skilling said,  referring to large power plants that produce power in steady quantities  around the clock.   ""Base load simply delivers megawatts - that's a bulky, undifferentiated  commodity,"" Skilling said. ""But peaking plants allow us to play on the shape  of the market of that commodity.""   Skilling declined to give any projections or figures related to Enron's  future development plans, saying that they weren't set in stone.   But Skilling said the company generally aims to site power plants where there  are bottlenecks in the transmission system, and that Enron isn't focused on  any one geographic region as opposed to others.   ""There are companies out there saying they're going to build 40,000  megwawatts by such-and-such a date, and I don't really see how that's  possible,"" Skilling said.

Since this is a regulated asset, regulatory approval will be required, and  the consumers will receive part of the benefit of the monetization.  The  essence of our deal is that Enron will receive 50% of the net earnings, up to  $25mm, as our fee.  In consideration for this fee, Enron takes the financial,  legal, accounting and engineering lead. Peoples and Enron will work together  on the regulatory strategy formulation and implementation.  We want to present a draft MOU to Peoples this week.  The basic goals are:  Define scope of the agreement Define our lead role in the 4 stated areas Create exclusivity for Enron  Define financial arrangements (cost/profit) Get an acknowledgement that what was presented to them was proprietary, and  covered by our confidentiality agreement.

In that regard an immediate concern is getting  the engineering work kicked off.    We want the agreement broad enough to cover physical withdrawals.

ENA typically does not provide credit support of project co's  under the fair value model because of certain bright line tests under the  fair value model for an asset purchase to qualify for fair value.    From a bank financing and economic perspective, ENA has a total return swap  with Delta Power, the 100% owner of Ponderosa Pine (Ponderosa Pine is  bankruptcy remote).  There possibly could be credit support from ENA for the project co if we were  compensated a fair value fee for the support, but this issue has never been  tested with AALLP (would need third party fairness opinion).  In the end,  there could only be a form of financial support, not a performance  guarantee.

2022-04-13 00:44:51+00:00,false,4,"  Dan,  Thanks for the email and quick response.  I am in the process of discussing  this with various people.  A couple of observations that have become clear  and  I want to pass them on to you.  Overall, the size of the transaction is  not going to fly.  If we brought in other players and significantly reduced  our exposure and the other players validated the technology and overall play,  it would increase the odds that we are interested in this type of deal.  Rick  Buy stated firmly that Jeff will not be interested in taking this type of  deal to the board especially with what just happened with Ecogas and Kafus.  I called George last night and touched on these topics but they have been  reconfirmed this morning.  I understand that the deal is very active and  needs to move forward now, but I think we should inform Pacificorp that we  will not take the entire deal.  Last night George stated that he may not want  to tell them that and I agreed.  But upon reflection, I think that needs to  be re-addressed.  The original deal size is DOA and if I really believe that,  then not passing that information could hurt us in getting any size deal  potentially closed with these guys.  Also having them assist in bringing  others to the table might be beneficial.  I'll keep you informed as i move forward and learn more.  Mike      Daniel Reck 08/07/2000 06:34 PM To: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: George McClellan/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: draft  Mike and Jeff:  Attached is a copy of the Pacificorp presentation from last week.  To  reiterate, the key commercial risk issues are:  1)  Tax--Jordan Mintz has a high degree of confidence regarding the  qualifications of the Pacificorp machines.  Thorough due dilligence will be  required to investigate the representations made in the private letter ruling  applications.  2)  Syndication--Joe Deffner and Tim Proffitt are working to find  monetizers.  Ideally, the monetizers would close when we do.  Realistically,  we have to assume that we will bridge the deal and wear equity risk until we  can shed our ownership.  Pacificorp has expressed an interest in staying in  as 25% owner, which should reduce the bridge risk, since we can show the  former owner staying in the game.  3)  Operations--The risk of operations will lie with the holders of the  equity.  Post-syndication, the new owners can contract directly with an  operator.  For tax purposes the owner needs to have some risk.  We will guide  the monetizers to this risk.  If we have to indemnify them in this area, we  will need to better understand the available insurance products. 4)  Marketing--This is the risk the coal desk is trying to acquire.  The desk  believes that the coal/synfuel spread risk will decrease dramatically over  the next 12-18 months.  We have put $6.00/ton into the model, and the desk  will buy $3.00/ton today for seven years.  The current market is anywhere  from $1.00-3.00/ton.  We have also developed a list of strong sites that are  looking for machines, three of which we control, either through options or  marketing agreements.  The economics of the deal are compelling.  We put out $100mm to Pacificorp as  an equity bridge (maybe less if they stay in as 25% owner).  We collect  $30-50mm in commodity spread origination, and another $30-50mm in equity  origination.  Commercially, the deal makes sense, and I am confident that we can structure  around the risks.  The decision we need from senior management is whether  this is a game we want to play.  The machines fit into the letter of the  law.  Big companies (AIG, Florida Progress, Detroit Edison, etc.) have joined  in the reindeer games.  We can put on the position we want by bridging this  deal.  On the flip side, people have heartburn over ""spirit of the law"" issues and  those are questions that senior management has to decide.   We have a chance  to move on these machines, but need to make up our mind by the end of this  week whether to put resources on it.  We can back out later (our commitment  so far is non-binding), but we can't get back in.  Please let me know your thoughts.  Regards,  Dan      ","Dan, Thanks for the email and quick response.

A few thoughts: Add a section of what the collection will not be. e.g.:  not so contemporary  that majority of people will have a very negative reaction.  Understanding  that not everyone will ever agree on everything Address a few ideas on key locations and options per key areas.  For  example:  5 key large major areas could contain the following themes - 1  large painting by commissioned contemporary recognized artists.  Present a  few artists as options and ideas.  Key trading areas:  could be modern and  high energy to reflect the culture or the opposite, more serene commentary as  a balance.  pick artists as an idea. Address key themes:  trading are will have xxxx, individual business unit  common areas can be distinct to their culture with guidelines such as xxxx.   Describe the area reserved for Enron  memorabilia? General theme considerations and guidelines: Innovation, global, as you've  already addressed List out options with front entry area (Nevelson) Address old building and what we are going to do with the collection:  for  example art work will be more consistent within business units and will be  re-aligned, common areas will link with new concepts and themes A few thoughts on budget and generally how it will be spent as a guideline:   e.g.:  20% will be spent on 5 key areas, 10% on trading floor areas..... Timeline and the need to start now Update:  RC set up and ready, funding by Andy Fastow  I hope this helps and gives you feedback as you wanted.

Taking  insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of  complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it  they would die.  Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF  is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money  raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise  $225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5  years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team  leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the  walk this year is ""Knock Out Diabetes"" and we would like to have you join us  for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron  people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.  If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if  you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee  members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please  contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included  in the first important and informative training session taking place this  week.

In fact, I am coaching my sons soccer team and  have a 5 year old diabetic on my team.  Just a thought for you.................I have been on an insulin pump for the  past 7 years and it has made a tremendous difference for my life.  Certainly  worth exploring if you are not using one.  Also, my brother ( Bank of America  employee ) is on the ADA board for the Southeast region if you may wish to  contact him about speakers ( doctors ).

The RAC-Market Risk Group believes that the calculations are  generally correct according to accepted methodology.  While it is not  perfect, the primary issues are not with the calculations but with the data  inputs and the expectations of John Nowlan of interday position changes  (where actual trades done have been different than his expectations).  There  has been a proposal to change the calculation of forward-forward volatilities  offered by the option trader.  After a review of that request, we believe  that it would be better to adopt the change proposed and implemented on the  North American Gas desk.

I continue to serve on the  board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for  this year's fundraising efforts.  As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.   Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the  multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot  imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking  insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of  complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it  they would die.  Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF  is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money  raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise  $225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5  years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team  leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the  walk this year is ""Knock Out Diabetes"" and we would like to have you join us  for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron  people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.  If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if  you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee  members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please  contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included  in the first important and informative training session taking place this  week.

Here are the ones who are still considering UT: Quarterback Bret Rawls, 6-5, 200, 4.7, Shreveport Evangel (LSU, UT, FSU, Tenn) Running Back Jabari Davis, 5-11, 224, 4.5, Tucker, Ga. (Tenn, Ga, UT, Neb, Ala) Eric Shelton, 6-3, 230, 4.45, Lexington, Ky., Bryan Station (Ky, FSU, Fla, Tenn, UT) Fullback James Buchanan, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Sarasota, Fla.

Orleans De La Salle (FSU, LSU, Mich, A&M, = UT) * * * * On the out-of-staters, UT has a 50-50 shot at Hall, and Rawls, Jakes and Buchanan also are very seriously considering the Longhorns. Cody says he definitely will visit UT, so the Horns have a fair chance with him. The odd= s are much longer on Davis, Shelton, Spears and Hill.  Scouting Louisiana-Lafayette  If the Longhorns don't break their 10-quarter scoring drought quickly in their Sept. 9 season opener against Louisiana-Lafayette in Austin, it will = be a very bad sign. The Ragin' Cajuns didn't do much ragin' last season, going 2-9 with their only victories coming over 1-AA Wofford and Middle Tennessee. They also gave up an average of 219 yards per game rushing and allowed opposing backs to average 5.5 yards per rush. The Cajuns run a spread offense with four wideouts, but they didn't score a touchdown until their fifth game last season. Coach Mack Brown says you don't really know what you have until you start playing other teams. He still won't know after this day in the park. The game starts at 11:30 a.m. on Sept. 9 and will be televised by the Fox Network on a syndicated basis.  Baseball Adds 1, Loses 1  The Longhorn baseball coaches have signed shortstop Shaff Elkouri, 5-11, 17= 5, from Seward County JC in Kansas, but they lost one of their prized recruits last weekend when slugger Jason Stokes of Coppell signed with Florida for $= 2 million. Elkouri will be a sophomore at Texas this season.  Big Basketball Recruiting Week Coming Up  The season opener in football is always big news, and it's also going to be=  a big deal for basketball this year because both Longhorn teams have some big-time recruits taking official visits the Sept. 9 weekend. It's really big for the men, who have only one scholarship remaining. T. J. Ford, the 5-11 point guard who led Fort Bend Willowridge to the state Class 5A championship last season, will visit. Ford is the player the UT coaches want, and there is a chance he will commi= t on his visit. The Longhorn women have three scholarships left, and two outstanding player= s have scheduled visits for the Sept. 9 weekend. One of them has a name you will remember. She is Lauren Selmon, a 6-0 guard-forward from Norman, Okla. If that rings a bell, you are right. She is the daughter of Dewey Selmon, o= ne of those three great defensive line brothers who starred at Oklahoma a quarter of a century ago. I was in Oklahoma, working as a political reporter for The Associated Press= , when the Selmons played at OU. Unlike some of the later Sooner stars, who made the wrong kind of headlines off the field, the Selmons are fine people The other is Jody Bell, a 6-2 forward from Chestermere HS in Alberta, Canad= a. She averaged a triple double last season (14 points, 10 assists, 12 rebound= s).  High School Subs at 160  True Orange is going to 160 schools, thanks to several generous subscribers= .

Our  objective is the objective, not necessarily the path taken.  I think there is  more than one way to draw a circle, and your proposal looks equally as good.  We will perform step 1.

You asked if GA can provide a list of regulatory and statutory activities  that may impact our position on your top 30 utilities.  That's not the way we  need to proceed.  Instead, what I'd like to do (and what I think Scott also agrees with) is  have the right people from the desk and the right people from GA jointly  develop what the regulatory hedge strategy should be for each of the major  utility positions.   In each case, the process should be something like -   1) re-review the curve, identify major uncertainties and major certainties, 2) re-review the position, identify what the major deals are that constitute  the position, and any nuances about the deal that would be beneficial to know  about , like term, type of pricing, etc., 3) brainstorm the things that could be done, legislatively, regulatorily, or  other, to protect or improve the position, 4) brainstorm how the things identified in #3 could best be done, what  resources would be required, and whether the chances for success warrant the  expenditure and effort 5) have GA take the lead in writing up a regulatory strategy, complete with  milestones and timelines for when we should expect to see things happen, and  what the off-ramps to the strategy will be, perhaps including the point at  which the curve would be changed 6) have GA and the desk interactively communicate on the success of the  strategy.  So far, we are at about : stage 2 for Com Ed, Duke, SPS, Ohio Power, and Illinois Power stage 4 for PG&E,  stage 3 for HL&P, and ready to get started for the rest.  The integration of people so far is  Com Ed, IP  (Sue L, Roy Boston, Ajit Gill) Ohio Power (Janine, Burranit?) PG&E  (Roger, Mona ) HL&P  (Jeff, Pat Keene, Robin Kittel)  So, my recommendation for next steps is to drive these existing efforts  through to stage 6, and get the rest of the utilities started by naming the  right personnel.

2022-04-13 18:37:43+00:00,true,6,"  For your background and heads-up, we understand that the U.S. Senate is very  close to agreement on a pipeline safety bill and it may be voted on by the  full Senate as early as Wednesday evening.  Although this bill pre-dates the  pipeline explosion in New Mexico and is not directly linked to it, the  tragedy seems to have hastened the progress of this proposed bill.  We  suspect that when approved in the Senate, this bill may draw press coverage  and create some headlines, though the focus of the media attention and the  reaction of gas trading markets--if any-- sems hard to predict.  One possible  ""market-moving"" aspect of this legislation may be the announced increased  costs that will need to be borne by pipeline operators in the future to fund  new R&D and new safety measures.    The main points of this bill are:  The bill would impose several new requirements on pipeline operators  regarding inspection methods and community ""right to know.""  The language  specifically allows for ""periodic assessment of the integrity of the pipeline  through methods including internal inspection, pressure testing, direct  assessment, or other effective methods.""  The bill would allow greater state authority over interstate pipes, with  coordination between state and local officials and the Office of Pipeline  Safety.  OPS will remain the controlling authority in matters of pipeline  safety.  It would provide more R&D money and authorize an increase in user fees over  the next two years.     Cost assessment:  the legislation will increase operators' day-to-day costs  and impose greater user fees.   Based on the calls for greater R&D, and for  better OPS/DOT inspection capabilities in the future, we can expect  appropriations in the next few fiscal years to be targeted for substantial  increases -- most of which will come out of user fees paid by pipelines.  Political assessment:   Apparently the changes made to the bill in recent  weeks reflect a number of the arguments Enron has been making in negotiations  to make the McCain bill more palatable.  Even in the face of the El Paso  incident, the Enron Political Affairs staff has reportedly been able to make  meaningful changes to what was previously an unacceptable piece of  legislation.  In the assessment of the Enron DC office, it is certainly in  the best interests of the industry to lobby for its passage, given the  political uncertainties of a new Congress in 2001 -- it would not be  beneficial to have to re-start our negotiations from scratch next year.  In the House of Representatives:  The House has its own pipeline safety bill  pending.  It remains to be seen whether the leadership will push for this  bill (which will require reconciliation with the Senate bill before it can  become a law), or whether the House will just adopt the bill that comes out  of the Senate.  With only about four weeks left in the congressional session,  final passage of a bill out of Congress will likely come only at the end of  the session in October.

The  short list is 6 companies, not 5.  Out of 12 companies, 8 responded and we  were second the last.  NIMO was disappointed that more companies did not bid  on their RFP.  I asked if an extra $2MM would have pushed us into the short  list.  NIMO said yes but it would still not be the highest bid.  Our bid was  $4.9 MM.  I think we may have undervalued the CNG transport, storage  optionality and the TGP Zone 5 deliveries into NIMO (new interconnect).  I have forwarded the peaking proposal to Mark Breese last week and he is  working on it.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Bruce indicated NiMo  short listed five companies who all bid higher than ENA.  However, he also  mentioned we were a close sixth, that is close to the fifth highest bid. He  gave no indication on the value of the highest bid.  He also said that the  other five companies making the short list all proposed alternative  structures to the proposed NiMo Tier Structure.    NiMo released an additional RFP for peaking supplies for this winter, I  believe Phil should have or be getting that RFP.   Phil if you could please make copies and distribute ASAP.

According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this  opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far  as we know, has constructed such a vessel.    I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the  Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they  have not built such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel  would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required  operational and  environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.   Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel, http://www.tecnomare.it/marine/project/ling.htm  Please let me know if any further research is needed.

2022-04-13 02:11:26+00:00,true,6,"  Rick:  unfortunately, the stand alone reliability legislation DOES have a  ""reasonable chance of passing.""  To block this possibility, we are pursuing  two strategies simultaneously.  #1 the Stakeholder letter with the message  that the bill does little for reliability and provides no real political  inoculation so should not be passed; and #2 the lack of consensus on the  technical language contained within the bill makes passage problematic.  If  the bill were to be able to move, the bill must be considered ""consensus""  otherwise it  will pose political problems for the Calendar.  Today, there is  still lack of bill consensus.  We should consider a strategy of asking for  reasonable legislative provisions beyond the current language which would  improve the bill (and continue to keep true consensus from occurring.)  Of  course, we cannot be obvious on this approach.    Part of the reason I was pushing to get one or our CEO's to play golf with  Congressman Tauzin on the 22nd is he is the key Member pushing the House  Leadership to pass the stand-alone bill now to ""politically inoculate  Republicans.""  As the likely new House Commerce Committee Chairman; he  carries sway.  Another approach would be for us to call Entergy to give  Congressman Tauzin the same message.  And our #3 strategy.....pray that the temperature cools down so the issue  dissipates.....and/or they run out of time......

Although Enron would like the letter to be stronger, this letter  went through many revisions to reach the consensus language necessary for a  larger group to sign.  Thus, while not a perfect letter, it would send a  stronger message with a multitude of signatures.  The status of the letter is that it is being ""held in our back pocket"" should  it become necessary.  Pre-approval has been given and it stands in an  ""almost"" final form.  Should you have any grave problems with the letter, let  me know, and I will see what's possible given the constraints posed by the  group.    On a separate but related note, we are working with Joe and Dan to prepare a  short white paper to detail the ""technical problems"" still remaining with the  Wynn legislative language and will communicate these problems, Enron's  opposition and lack of bill ""consensus"" to the Hill shortly (as soon as this  paper is ready.)

I talked to Scott Neal about Eagan and he asked to be included in any  discussions.  As far as the value of the capacity that will depend on the injection rate,  storage capacity and withdrawal rate as well as what pipelines are involved.

2022-04-13 21:42:22+00:00,true,6,"  True Orange, Part 2  Recruiting Roundup  RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee and OL Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter are = UT commitments who are on USA-Today's Top 25 national players. Two other UT pledges =01) OL Abe Robinson of Jersey Village and QB-Athlete Kendal Briles of Frenship =01) are on some national top 100 lists. Benson, running behind an all-new offensive line, is still racking up impressive numbers. He had 14 carries for 140 yards and a TD, plus a 38-yar= d reception, in the defending state champions' 40-12 victory over a good Victoria team in the season opener, then scored four touchdowns on just nin= e carries, good for 142 yards, in a 40-7 romp past Longview. His four TDs came on runs of 19, 4, 85 and 4 yards. For the year, he has 23= , carries, 282 yards and five touchdowns. Behind an inexperienced OL, he is averaging 12.3 yards per carry and a touchdown every 4.6 carries. Terrance Young, the huge Longview OL who also has committed to UT, said it was a long way to go for a high school football game, but he said it was worth it just to see Benson run. ""I heard he was the best running back in the nation and he is awesome,"" You= ng said. "" Blocking for him is going to be a lot of fun. He is an awesome player."" Benson won't have the monster year he had last year, at his present pace, simply because he isn't carrying the ball as much. Lee coach John Parchman, trying for a third consecutive state title, is working on a more diversified attack to try to spread things out a little more. When you lose as many seniors as he did, you have to improvise. Briles, the Class 4A Offensive Player of the Year while leading Stephenvill= e to the state title in 1999, is at a new 4A school, Wolfforth Frenship near Lubbock, because his dad, former Stephenville coach Art Briles, is on the coaching staff at Texas Tech. But don't worry about him requiring any time to get adjusted. Frenship open= ed its season Friday and Briles passed for 279 yards and four touchdowns and r= an for 105 more yards and two more tallies in a 47-20 conquest of Canyon, an 11-3 playoff team last year. I went to Houston to scout some players last weekend. Galena Park North Sho= re beat Alief Hastings Friday night in Galena Park, where it actually rained. It's been so dry in Austin lately that I enjoyed getting wet. North Shore TE James Moses and DE/LB Jonathan Jackson both looked good, but=  a guy who really caught my eye was Hastings' DT Rodrique Wright, a junior who is listed in the program as 6-5, 324. If he is No. 61, as the program state= s, he looks about 6-4, 270, but he is a fine player. He stuffs the run, and he has great quickness to chase  the passer. Look for him to be a big-time recruit next year. Aldine played Madison in a battle of Class 5A Houston powers. Aldine won, b= ut the most impressive players in the game were Madison OL William Winston and his team's junior QB, Vincent Young. Winston has the quickest feet of any 330-pounder I've seen this year. Aldine's Lawrence Hooper is a highly recruited DE. Some people think he's t= he best one in the state, but Winston definitely won their individual battle. = At 6-6, 330, he is big enough to overpower most opponents, and he is incredibl= y quick at sliding out to pick up speed rushers. He is still considering Texa= s, A&M and a lot of other people, and he is a prize. Young is 6-5, 190, and he runs a sub-4.5 40. He has a powerful arm, but Aldine is a ground-oriented team and he is outstanding on the option. He wi= ll be one of the state's top 10 recruits next year. Selvin Young, the great Jersey Village junior running back who topped the 2,200-yard rushing mark as a sophomore, is still bothered by the badly sprained ankle he suffered at the end of last season, and he saw only limit= ed action in his team's opener. * * * * Eric Hall, the fine defensive end from Clarksville, Tenn., took his officia= l visit to Texas last weekend, and his mother said he had a great time. He didn't get home in time for me to talk to him before going to press, but he told me before he came that Texas was his No. 1 choice, and his mother said he told her the visit went even better than he expected. Other high school stars who came to the game Saturday included three of the state's top 10 players =01) DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellis, OL Jami High= tower of Jacksonville and S Dewayne Brandon of Temple. Harris said he had a great time at UT. ""It was great seeing all those peopl= e in the stands,"" he said. ""I can really see myself as a Longhorn. I couldn't believe some of the plays Roy Williams made. They tell you that you can pla= y as a freshman if you're good enough, and he proved that's true."" But he said he wants to take some official visits before making committing = to anyone. Brandon also said Texas is his top choice. Hightower says it's a three-team race between Texas, A&M and Nebraska ""and nobody is out front. I want to take official visits to all three of them before making up my mind."" Killeen Ellison MLB Yamil Lebron and San Antonio Holmes CB Cedric Griffin, two other UT commitments, also were at the game. * * * * The Horns have 13 total commitments.

Orleans De La Salle (FSU, LSU, Mich, A&M, = UT)  Recruiting: Proof Is in the Pudding  I've been covering recruiting since 1990, and there definitely is a correlation between recruiting success and success on the field. But Dave Campbell's Texas Football Magazine has been around a lot longer th= an that, and subscriber Grant Erwin of Dallas went back to 1983, the year befo= re the Aggies finally started having success against Texas after decades of being hammered, and compiled the results. The magazine ranks recruiting classes in June of the following year, so it = is able to study every other ranking in detail before coming up with its own list of top recruits. That should give it a great degree of accuracy. Here is what the study showed:  DCTF Recruiting Rankings in the Southwest Conference, plus results of UT-A&= M game: **83: A&M #1, Texas #3  UT won, 45-13 **84: A&M #1, Texas #4  A&M won, 37-12 **85: A&M #2, Texas #3  A&M won, 42-10 **86: A&M #1, Texas #5  A&M won, 16-3 **87: A&M #1, Texas #4  A&M won, 20-13 88: A&M #1, Texas #2        A&M won, 28-24 89: Texas #1, A&M #2        A&M won, 21-10 90: A&M #1, Texas #3        Texas won, 28-27 91: A&M #1, Texas #2        A&M won, 31-14 92: A&M #1, Texas #2        A&M won, 34-13 93: Texas #1, A&M #2        A&M won, 18-9 94: A&M #1, Texas #2        A&M won, 34-10 95: Texas #1, A&M #2        Texas won, 16-6  DCTF Recruiting Rankings in the Big XII South 96: A&M #1, Texas #2        Texas won, 51-15 97: Texas #1, A&M #2        A&M won, 27-16 **98: Texas #1, A&M #3  Texas won, 26-24 **99: Texas #1, A&M #2  A&M won, 20-16 **00: Texas #1, A&M #2 ** Indicates recruiting battle won by a wide margin, according to Dave Campbell's rating system.  A&M put together several outstanding classes in a row in the early 1980's, and kept it going, with the exception of 1989, until Texas started having good recruiting success again in 1993. It's no coincidence that the Aggies, who had never  won more than three in = a=20 row against the Longhorns (and that was way back in 1909-10-11), won five i= n a row and nine times in 10 years during their recruiting dominance over the Longhorns. Team with superior talent rarely lose to less talented teams, and that is w= hy the Aggies enjoyed their decade in the sun. But look at those recent classes. All the strange happenings at A&M last season delayed the inevitable, in my opinion, and, if those recruiting rankings continue to prove as accurate a crystal ball as they have in the last two decades, the Longhorns' supremacy in recruiting should make this first decade of the new century a great one for UT in this long series, whi= ch the Horns already lead, 67-34-5.  Four Baseball Stars Commit  The Longhorn  baseball coaches already have commitments from four top baseball players. They are catcher Jack Sweeney, 6-2, 200, of powerhouse Houston Bellaire and three hard-throwing right-handed pitchers =01)  Joey Guajardo, 6-0, 190, wh= o threw three no-hitters as a junior at Round Rock, and  Austin Westlake aces Chaz Taylor, 6-3, 180, and, Huston Street, 5-11, 180. Street, who was 6-1 with a 1.27 ERA last season,  is the son of former UT football and baseball star James Street. Taylor pitched a two-hitter this summer against the Dallas Mustangs, a powerful team that included seven college players or signees, including Jas= on Stokes of Coppell. He struck Stokes out twice in that game. Stokes, a UT signee, signed a $2 million pro contract last week. Sweeney started 10 games as a freshman at Bellaire and has been a starter ever since. He is the best defensive catcher in the country and also wields=  a powerful bat.  Basketball Recruiting  The weekend of the first Longhorn football game also was a huge recruiting weekend for both Texas basketball teams. T. J. Ford, the 5-11 point guard who led Fort Bend Willowridge to the Class 5A State Championship last season, took his official visit to UT. He said he enjoyed the trip. ""I really like the coaches and the players and there are a lot of things to do at UT and in Austin,"" he said. He said he plans to visit Cincinnati and possibly Louisville and Houston before making a decision. Ford is one of the top three point guards in the country. The Longhorn women had two top recruits in town for official visits. They a= re 6-2 forward Jody Bell of Chestermere HS in Calgary, Canada, and 5-11 guard Lauren Selmon of Norman, Okla. Selmon is the daughter of former OU and pro football star Dewey Selmon.  Football Videos Available  Host Communications is offering its season video package against this year. You can get a video each week with the complete UT football game on it, plu= s some of coach Mack Brown's pre-game, half-time and post-game comments to th= e team and media, and the Longhorn radio team's play-by-play when you sign up= . It's $250 for the 11-game package, and, if UT makes the Big 12 championship game, that one is included, too. To order the package, you can call 512-478-1833 and ask for Extension 10. I get this package and it's a great way to watch each game because all the huddles and the time between plays are eliminated. I can watch the entire game, with coach Brown's comments, in less than an hour.  UT Women Set Schedule  The Longhorn women's basketball schedule features 27 regular season games, highlighted by UT's hosting of the elite Four in the Fall doubleheader basketball tournament (Saturday, Dec. 9) which will  be televised nationall= y on FOX Sports Net.

2022-04-13 02:12:17+00:00,true,6,"  Congressman DeLay is with us.....but with the demise of Speaker Gingrich, the  role of Committee Chairman has been reinstated.  Thus, this to-be Chairman is  going straight to the Speaker which poses both a political and House Rules  conundrum.  Of course, we are also going to the Speaker, the Majority Leader,  etc.  But it becomes the ""pet rock"" game where one Member respects another  Member's ""pet rock"" so that Member respects his ""pet rock.""  The one  outstanding pressure point we retain is lame-duck Chairman Bliley who is on  our side yet his relationship with the Leadership is poor while Congressman  Tauzin's remains stellar.  You might recall that Congressman Tauzin switched  parties with the price tag being many bennies and ""secret deals"" from  Leadership.  As of today, Congressman Barton is also on our side (but with  the death of his brother, his mother's open heart surgery, his wife's breast  cancer scare, etc.) we have not gotten him to refocus on approaching  Congressman Tauzin yet.  I will do this at the appropriate time.  I have kept  Ed Buckham apprised of our strategies.

To block this possibility, we are pursuing  two strategies simultaneously.  #1 the Stakeholder letter with the message  that the bill does little for reliability and provides no real political  inoculation so should not be passed; and #2 the lack of consensus on the  technical language contained within the bill makes passage problematic.  If  the bill were to be able to move, the bill must be considered ""consensus""  otherwise it  will pose political problems for the Calendar.  Today, there is  still lack of bill consensus.  We should consider a strategy of asking for  reasonable legislative provisions beyond the current language which would  improve the bill (and continue to keep true consensus from occurring.)  Of  course, we cannot be obvious on this approach.    Part of the reason I was pushing to get one or our CEO's to play golf with  Congressman Tauzin on the 22nd is he is the key Member pushing the House  Leadership to pass the stand-alone bill now to ""politically inoculate  Republicans.""  As the likely new House Commerce Committee Chairman; he  carries sway.  Another approach would be for us to call Entergy to give  Congressman Tauzin the same message.  And our #3 strategy.....pray that the temperature cools down so the issue  dissipates.....and/or they run out of time......

Although Enron would like the letter to be stronger, this letter  went through many revisions to reach the consensus language necessary for a  larger group to sign.  Thus, while not a perfect letter, it would send a  stronger message with a multitude of signatures.  The status of the letter is that it is being ""held in our back pocket"" should  it become necessary.  Pre-approval has been given and it stands in an  ""almost"" final form.  Should you have any grave problems with the letter, let  me know, and I will see what's possible given the constraints posed by the  group.    On a separate but related note, we are working with Joe and Dan to prepare a  short white paper to detail the ""technical problems"" still remaining with the  Wynn legislative language and will communicate these problems, Enron's  opposition and lack of bill ""consensus"" to the Hill shortly (as soon as this  paper is ready.)  I believe ELCON, EPSA and CMA will continue to share our  opposition although confusion remains on the Hill as to the exact reasons for  our opposition given the numerous versions of the legislation circulating.   thanks.   - 08_04_00_Draft_Stake_ltr_WJL.doc               ","Congressman DeLay is with us.....but with the demise of Speaker Gingrich, the role of Committee Chairman has been reinstated.

2022-04-13 07:00:48+00:00,true,6,"  Fri, 18 Aug 2000 14:13:09  You have been  added to the CORPGEN mailing list  (Committee of Corporate General Counsel  of the Business  Law Section) by BLS  List Administrator <bllserve@ABANET.ORG>.  Please save this message for future  reference, especially if this is the first time you are subscribing to an electronic mailing list. If you ever need to leave  the list, you will find the  necessary instructions below. Perhaps  more importantly,  saving a  copy of  this message  (and of  all future subscription notices  from other mailing lists) in  a special mail folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you are subscribed  to. This may  prove very useful the  next time you  go on vacation and  need to leave  the lists temporarily so  as not to  fill up your  mailbox while  you  are away!  You should  also  save the  ""welcome messages"" from the  list owners that you will  occasionally receive after subscribing to a new list.  To send  a message to  all the people  currently subscribed to  the list, just send mail  to CORPGEN@MAIL.ABANET.ORG. This is  called ""sending mail to the  list,"" because  you send  mail to a  single address  and LISTSERV makes  copies  for all  the  people  who  have subscribed.  This  address (CORPGEN@MAIL.ABANET.ORG)  is also  called the  ""list address.""  You must never try to send any command to that address, as it would be distributed to all the people  who have subscribed. All commands must  be sent to the ""LISTSERV  address,"" LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG.  It is  very important  to understand  the difference  between the  two, but  fortunately it  is not complicated. The LISTSERV address is like  a FAX number that connects you to  a machine,  whereas the  list  address is  like a  normal voice  line connecting you to a person. If you make a mistake and dial the FAX number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone, you will quickly realize that you  used the wrong  number and call again.  No harm will  have been done. If on the other hand  you accidentally make your FAX call someone's voice  line,  the  person  receiving the  call  will  be  inconvenienced, especially if your FAX then re-dials  every 5 minutes. The fact that most people will eventually connect the FAX machine to the voice line to allow the FAX  to go through  and make  the calls stop  does not mean  that you should continue to send FAXes to  the voice number. People would just get mad at you.  It works pretty much  the same way with  mailing lists, with the difference  that you are calling  hundreds or thousands of  people at the same  time, and consequently  you can expect a  lot of people  to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list address.  You may leave the list at any time by sending a ""SIGNOFF CORPGEN"" command to LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG. You  can also tell LISTSERV how  you want it to confirm the  receipt of messages you  send to the list. If  you do not trust the  system, send a ""SET  CORPGEN REPRO"" command and  LISTSERV will send  you a  copy of  your own  messages, so  that you  can see  that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way. After a while you  may find  that this  is getting  annoying, especially  if your  mail program does not  tell you that the  message is from you  when it informs you that new  mail has arrived from  CORPGEN. If you send  a ""SET CORPGEN ACK  NOREPRO"" command,  LISTSERV will  mail you  a short  acknowledgement instead, which will  look different in your mailbox  directory. With most mail programs you  will know immediately that this  is an acknowledgement you can read later. Finally, you can turn off acknowledgements completely with ""SET CORPGEN NOACK NOREPRO"".  Following  instructions from  the list  owner, your  subscription options have been  set to ""REPRO""  rather than  the usual LISTSERV  defaults. For more  information  about subscription  options,  send  a ""QUERY  CORPGEN"" command to LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG.  Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived. You can get a list of the available archive files by sending an ""INDEX CORPGEN"" command to LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG. You  can then order these files  with a ""GET CORPGEN LOGxxxx"" command, or using LISTSERV's database search facilities. Send an ""INFO DATABASE"" command for more information on the latter.  This  list is  available  in digest  form.  If you  wish  to receive  the digested  version  of the  postings,  just  issue  a SET  CORPGEN  DIGEST command.  Please note that  it is presently possible for other  people to determine that  you are  signed up  to the  list through  the use  of the  ""REVIEW"" command,  which  returns   the  e-mail  address  and  name   of  all  the subscribers. If  you do not  want your name to  be visible, just  issue a ""SET CORPGEN CONCEAL"" command.  More  information on  LISTSERV  commands  can be  found  in the  LISTSERV reference  card, which  you can  retrieve  by sending  an ""INFO  REFCARD"" command to LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG.","Fri, 18 Aug 2000 14:13:09 You have been added to the CORPGEN mailing list (Committee of Corporate General Counsel of the Business Law Section) by the BLS List Administrator bllserve@ABANET.ORG>.

2022-04-13 21:41:53+00:00,true,6,"  Jerry Scarbrough's True Orange The Internet Newsletter and E-Mail Service for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful  Volume 10, No. 22, September 11, 2000  Applewhite, Freshmen Receivers Lead Horns To 52-10 Opening Win; UT No. 5 in AP Poll  The Longhorns opened their season at home Saturday by falling behind a 45-point underdog Louisiana-Lafayette team, but Major Applewhite came off t= he bench to spark a 31-point second quarter that paved the way for a 52-10 victory and a No. 5 ranking in the latest Associated Press Poll. Heralded sophomore Chris Simms got the starting nod at quarterback over Applewhite, who underwent off-season knee surgery after earning Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year honors in 1999. But Simms had a rocky start, and when his sideline pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown that gave the Ragin' Cajuns a shocking 10-0 lead with 1:27 left in the first quarter, the coaches turned to Applewhite to tr= y to pump some life into the dormant Longhorn offense. And he delivered big time. He led the Longhorns to seven straight scores = =01) six touchdowns and a field goal =01) before retiring for the day and lettin= g Simms handle the mop-up duties. For the day, Applewhite was 18 of 26 for 315 yards and four touchdowns =01)=  and that was in less than two quarters. He came in for the final 1:27 of the first quarter, played all the second quarter and then left for keeps just 4:51 deep into the third quarter with the Longhorns on top, 45-10. Coach Mack Brown still says the team has two first-team quarterbacks and he still says he won't name a starter for the Stanford game, but there is litt= le doubt that the quarterback controversy is over and Applewhite is the starti= ng quarterback once again. These coaches grade on performance and his scoring percentage Saturday was perfect =01) seven possessions, seven scores that turned a 10-0 hole into a 45-10 romp when he left the game. True freshmen wide receiver Roy Williams also had a big day. He caught six passes for 105 yards, including a super one-handed grab for 40 yards to get the Longhorns off their two-yard line. Heading into this game, the Longhorns had four big questions, and three of them got positive answers. Unfortunately, the one that didn't get the positive answer was the key one. Here are the questions, and the answers, at least for the short term: 1. Will the offensive line do a better job of blocking? This is the one that didn't get the positive answer. It actually did a good job of pass protecting, but the Longhorns couldn't run the football against=  a bad team that has small defensive linemen. Unless the line improves and the Horns can run with some success, the good defensive linemen will do just what our defensive linemen do against the Oklahoma's of the world, which is pin their ears back and harass the quarterback on every play. 2. Will those young wide receivers be able to pick up the slack for Kwame Cavil, Ryan Nunez and Jeremy Jones, last year's big three? Yes! Yes! Yes! Williams, B. J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas, the three heralded true freshmen, combined to catch 11 passes for 182 yards, and another gjuy seeing his first action, redshirt freshman Artie Ellis, tacked on four more catches for 38 more yards and two touchdowns. As Darrell Royal used to say, ""if a dog will bite, he'll bite as a pup."" These pups have big teeth and th= ey know how to use them. 3. Will the special teams be better? They were Saturday. Brown said the kicking game ""was the best since we've been here,"" and that tells the story. Kris Stockton punted for a 48-yard average, the kickoffs went team, and the Longhorn punt and kickoff returner= s got some positive yardage. 4. Will the young defensive ends be able to fill in for four-year starter Aaron Humphrey and Cedric Woodard, a three-starter, first at tackle, then a= t end? Sophomores Cole Pittman and Cory Redding, who was still bothered by a knee sprain, and true freshman Kalen Thornton all played well, and junior Jermai= n Anderson, who is swift but undersized, did a good job of rushing the passer= . This is a Longhorn team with a lot going for it in terms of talent, coachin= g and a more favorable schedule, but the lack of a dependable running game could prove fatal against a team that can pressure the quarterbacks. Here, briefly, is how the game went:  FIRST QUARTER With the temperature at 85 and rising, the Longhorns won the toss and deferred The Cajuns ran the deep kickoff back to the 19, then drove 77 yard= s in 15 plays, using up nearly half of the first quarter, before stalling at the Longhorn 4 and settling for a field goal to take a 3-0 lead with 7:55 left. Simms, getting the start over Applewhite at quarterback, led the Horn= s on a 40-yard drive that ended when Kris Stockton was wide on a 52-yard fiel= d goal try. The Cajuns couldn't move and had to punt, but Simms' third-down pass was picked off by Terrance Hunter at the UT 43 and he dashed in for th= e score to give the 45-point underdog Cajuns a 10-0 lead with 1:27 left. Vict= or Ike ran the kickoff back to the 46 and Applewhite came in and  hit TB Hodge= s Mitchell for 17 yards, then found Williams twice, for 9 and 24 yards, to reach the Cajun 4 as the quarter ended.  SECOND QUARTER Mitchell darted over right tackle for four yards and the touchdown on the first play of the quarter to get UT back in the game at 10-7. On the Horns' remaining four possessions in the half, Applewhite swiftly moved them 80 an= d 98 yards for touchdowns, nine yards for a field goal and 28 yards for a touchdown after a Joe Walker interception. That 31-point explosion put Texa= s comfortably on top at 31-10 at intermission. In that decisive second quarte= r, Texas had 290 yards offensively and Louisiana had 77.  THIRD QUARTER Ivan Williams ran the kickoff back to the UT 45 and Applewhite took Texas o= n two more quick scoring jaunts, first zipping 55 yards in five plays and the= n going 58 yards in four plays for two more TDs to push score to 45-10 and gi= ve him a perfect seven scores in seven tries. Simms relieved him at that point and hit three straight passes to lead Texas to its final touchdown with 6:5= 3 left in the quarter. Neither team threatened serious for the remainder of t= he quarter.  FOURTH QUARTER The Longhorns went back to trying to run the ball in the final quarter, without much success. The Cajuns did have one late drive that got to the Texas 16 before stalling, but that was the last serious drive by either tea= m.  True Orange Observations  It was feast or famine for the Longhorns in the running game. Here's the ne= t gain on each running play in chronological order: 0, 12, 0, 11, 5, 3, 0, 4, 1, 9, 1, minus 1, 0, 0,28, 7, 0, minus 4, 2, 7, 1= , minus 5, 4, 2. That is the primary reason Texas had the ball only 21:19 and Louisiana had = it 38:41. Most of the successful runs were draw plays. There were very few times when normal running plays made any yardage. In a 52-10 romp past an overmatched opponent, this is no big deal. But it could cost the team two or three games down the line unless the regular running plays start being more productive on a consistent basis.   900 Number Updated Daily I update my 900 number daily with football and football recruiting scoops.

Coach's Corner  Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns had to quit trying to run the ball Saturday because Louisiana-Lafayette had ""guys lined up in  every gap and they blitzed on every play."" He said he really wanted to establish a running game early, but it was much more sensible to go to an all-out passing attack because of the defense the Ragin' Cajuns were playing. Brown said, "" I was surprised Major (Applewhite) was able to play as well a= s he did the first time back after knee surgery."" ""Major played really well,"" he said. ""The protection was great. The momentu= m really changed when we put Major in, but we also changed our offense and starting putting four wide receivers out on every play."" He said Applewhite and Chris Simms, who started the game and played the fir= st two series before giving way to Applewhite, ""are both starting quarterbacks= . ""Chris had the great spring and he had an outstanding fall, but it wasn't that Major got beaten out. We just think we have two starting quarterbacks.= "" He also said, ""You just as well not ask me about next week's starter becaus= e I'm not going to say."" I didn't know who it would be in the opener, but I'm betting on Applewhite = to get the nod Saturday night in Palo Alto against the dangerous Stanford Cardinal because of his outstanding relief duty. Brown said he was pleasantly surprised with the  way his young receivers performed. ""It's been a long time since I've seen freshmen play with composure like that,"" he said. Roy Williams became the first UT freshman ever to pick up a 100-yard receiving game in his first start. He grabbed six passes for 105 yards, including a spectacular one-handed catch on a 40-yarder from Applewhite. ""Roy really played well,"" Brown said. ""One of the catches he made was phenomenal."" Two other true freshman wide receivers =01) B. J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas = =01) also had outstanding debuts. ""B. J. made some great catches,"" Brown said, ""and Sloan comes in, makes a catch on the sideline, then makes two guys miss."" ""I'm really pleased with the way the freshmen played,"" Brown said. ""They ke= pt their poise and helped us win the game."" Artie Ellis, a redshirt freshman, also had a good day, catching four passes for 38 yards, including two touchdowns. Ellis was a smashing success during spring practice and was expected to mak= e a big impact this year because of his 6-4, 210-pound frame and good speed a= nd his ability to catch the ball in a crowd. The four freshmen receivers accounted for 15 of the Longhorns' 25 reception= s and 220 of their 403 passing yards. Little-used fifth-year senior Brandon Healy also made up for lost time, wit= h four catches, two of them for touchdowns, for a total of 88 yards. Getting back to the quarterback duel, Brown said both players are handling the situation well and ""the team has confidence in both of them to get the job done."" ""We have to keep both of these quarterbacks upbeat,"" Brown said. ""We'll nee= d both of them to accomplish the goals we have set."" He said he and offensive coordinator Greg Davis ""talked to the guys long an= d hard about playing two quarterbacks."" ""We will always talk to the players about the quarterback situation before anyone else,"" he said. ""We're not going to throw one in or out because of a fan poll."" At his Sunday press conference, Brown said he was very pleased with the team's first-down efficiency, offensively and defensively, and was happy with the special teams' play. Looking at the lack of run production, he said, ""When you score 52 points, it's not important, but, for the season, it is important."" He said the Longhorns will work hard on improving their running game this week. ""We have to do a better job on running the football,"" he said. This was the fourth straight game in which the Horns had less than 100 yard= s rushing, but they lost the other three to end last season, so this time it wasn't fatal. Brown said Louisiana-Lafayette deserves a lot of credit for playing hard an= d he said Cajun QB Derek Dyer ""played really great."" ""But I thought our team was focused,"" he said. ""Louisiana had nothing to lose, but he had a lot to lose and nothing to gain."" He said all aspects of the kicking game pleased him Saturday. ""The kicking game was the best since we've been here,"" he said.   15 Freshmen Play  Fifteen freshmen played in Saturday's opening game. Eight of them were true freshmen and seven were redshirt freshmen. The eight true freshmen were WRs Roy Williams, B. J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas, TE Brock Edwards, DE Kalen Thornton, DT Stevie Lee, CB Nathan Vashe= r and S Phillip Geiggar. Williams, Johnson, Thornton and Lee played very early in the game. The seven redshirt freshmen were WR Artie Ellis, RB Ivan Williams, FB Brett Robin, OG Tillman Holloway, DT Marcus Tubbs, MLB Reed Boyd and S Dakarai Pearson. Holloway started due to weakened condition of Derrick Dockery, who was hospitalized last week with an infected cyst. Pearson also started because he is the nickel back and defensive coordinato= r Carl Reese came out with a five-defensive-back formation to start the game. Ellis and Boyd also saw a lot of early action. Inexperience at wide receiver was expected to be a problem for the Longhorn= s this season, but the trio of big, fast freshmen and Ellis combined Saturday to show it as a team strength. ""Those guys don't play like freshmen,"" Applewhite said.   It's a Great Time to Subscribe To The Fax/E-Mail Service I'll Have Frequent Reports on Recruiting And Practice Throughout the Season !

Scouting Stanford  The Longhorns face their first major test Saturday night when they play defending Pac 10 champion Stanford in Palo Alto. The game will start at 9:15 Texas time and will be televised by the Fox Network. Texas clobbered Stanford, 69-17, last year in Austin, and the Cardinal will be trying to turn the tables this year. Stanford went 8-4 overall last season and won the Pac 10 with a 7-1 record. But all four of the seniors they lost on offense were first-team All-Pac-10 players. They included QB Todd Husak and WR Troy Walters, the league's all-time leading receiver, plus two veteran offensive linemen Six defensive starters return from last year, including four linemen. But only one linebacker and one defensive back who started a year ago are on ha= nd. Stanford opened the season with a 24-10 victory over Washington State, and the Cardinal defense did not allow an offensive touchdown, but then the Cardinal fell to San Jose State, 40-27, Saturday night. San Jose State beat Stanford with a powerful running game. Spartan TB Deonc= e Whitaker gained 254 yards on 21 carries, scoring on runs of 5 and 65 yards and setting up two other TDs with long runs. Stanford QB Randy Fasani threw for 361 yards and four touchdowns in the offensive slugfest. If the Longhorns are going to have a running game anytime soon, this will b= e their best chance to do it. Texas probably will be at least a 10-point favorite, but this could be a dangerous game unless the Longhorns tackle better than they did last week a= nd force a few turnovers. The Horns also need to get their running game going or it will be one of those four-hour, 100-pass shootouts. Here are the three keys to victory, in my opinion: 1. Win the rushing battle. That doesn't sound like a big order against the pass-happy Cardinal, but the Longhorns haven't had a 100-yard rushing game = in their last four outings. 2. Put a lot of pressure on Fasani and do a good job of protecting the Texa= s quarterbacks. 3. Take care of the ball. Texas needs to win the turnover battle. I think this is a dangerous road trip, but I'll go out on a limb and pick t= he Longhorns to win by a 42-28 score. I think Texas will pressure Fasani and take care of the ball. Hopefully, the Horns can run the ball, too, but two out of three should be good enough.  Big 12 Roundup  Texas plays at Stanford, Colorado hosts Washington and Iowa State visits Io= wa in the top games involving Big 12 Conference teams this weekend. Nebraska survived a major scare at Notre Dame last week. Two touchdowns on kick returns almost carried the Irish to victory, but Nebraska rallied for = a 27-24 victory in overtime. In the only other big intersectional game, Colorado fell to USC, 17-14.  BIG 12 STANDINGS  SOUTHERN DIVISION Conference                  Season W   L  PF    PA     Pct.
