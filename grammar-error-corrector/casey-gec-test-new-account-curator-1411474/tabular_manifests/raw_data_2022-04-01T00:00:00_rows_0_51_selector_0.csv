We make the following points:-  1.   We notice that OM has agreed at least to a certain form of mutual limitation of liability clause in the OMNet Agreement and therefore we find  it a little odd that OM is unable to agree to any mutual limitation of liability clause in the OM Click Trade Application Licence.   We should be very grateful if OM would explain to us its reasoning for this in detail.  2.   In any event, it is entirely against Enron's legal policy to enter into agreements containing merely a unilateral limitation of liability clause protecting the other party.  Accordingly, we are not prepared to enter into  the OM Click Trade Application Licence in your current revised format.  I therefore attach, once again, as a Word document the text of Enron's  required clause on limitation of liability which I would suggest is added to the OM  Click Trade Application Licence as Clause 5.4.  (See attached file: OM Click Trade Licence Agreement - Rider.doc)  Once OM is in a position to agree to our required language, we should then be  in a position to execute the documentation.  I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

I  have never read a definitive account of that great moment in English naval  history.  Did Nelson fight in the Armada battle at Trafalgar? Is that the  battle Jack Aubrey is always talking about?     Where the hell is Trafalgar?   I have the idea it is down there by Gibraltar but can't find it on the map.   On the other hand, I have a vague fantasy of these little row boats coming  out at the mouth of the Thames to battle the mighty Armada.   When one  considers  what the panic must have been like in the Spanish fleet when they  realized that in spite of their size and assumed invincibility they were  actually vulnerable to that old maritime risk of sinking, one is  involuntarily  caused to cast one's badly  jaundiced commercial-legal  mind  upon  recent events of an analagous nature on board our own beloved ship,   sailing as it has been  in the northern  commercial straits.

Rcvd: May 11, 08:08 AM EDT ]     BW0167 MAY 11,1999 5:09 PACIFIC 8:09 EASTERN   ( BW)(CA-ARBINET-COMMUNICATIONS) Arbinet Communications Introduces On-Line  Trading of Bandwidth Derivatives   Business Editors/Technology Writers   SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 11, 1999--Arbinet Communications, Inc., the  world's leading trading network for telecommunications capacity, will inaugurate Internet trading of forwards and  options in telecommunications bandwidth later this month.   Trading in the bandwidth derivatives is being facilitated through Arbinet's  access-controlled website where buyers and sellers can post prices anonymously. Execution occurs offline, subject to a screening  process for credit, documentation and interoperability issues. The announcement was made at the TRA Conference,  Booth No. 1004.   As a second phase of the project, Arbinet is developing a physically settled  derivative product that will allow anonymous web-based execution, culminating in delivery to Arbinet switching hubs.  Implementation of this product is an extension of Arbinet's physically settled minutes trading system, the Arbinet Global  Clearing Network(TM) (AGCN(TM)).   Forward and option derivative trading in bandwidth provides distinct  advantages for clients who wish to hedge their exposure to future moves in the price of capacity. Furthermore, it provides a level  playing field where even small operators can realize the pricing advantages which were, until recently, available only to large  incumbent telecommunications carriers. Buyers and sellers can manage risk allowing them to better plan for the future.   Sellers of the forward contract can be natural suppliers of capacity such as  submarine cable operators. Buyers can be natural consumers (e.g. Internet Service Providers and Competitive Local Exchange  Carriers) or speculators.   ""Arbinet aims to be the premier provider of risk-management solutions for the  bandwidth market,"" said U. Kanad Chakrabarti, vice president of Bandwidth Trading, Arbinet. ""As a non-proprietary player,  we can offer impartial execution for our clients, which is important in a non-transparent and illiquid market like this.""   All bandwidth contracts will be posted on Arbinet's bandwidth trading site,  www.ebandwidth.net, beginning May 21, 1999. The forward contract allows buyers and sellers to reserve transmission  capacity. The option contract allows buyers and sellers to realize the optionality value present in the bandwidth market, but  currently not fully priced by telecommunications players.   ""We provide customers with a service not offered by any other on-line trading  company,"" said Alex Mashinsky, chairman and founder, Arbinet. ""Of key importance, we don't trade for ourselves, which  gives us complete objectivity in trade execution.   ""This new service is a natural outgrowth of our experience in trading telecom  minutes on behalf of international and multinational telecommunications carriers.""   For more information, contact U. Kanad Chakrabarti at (212) 230-1200 or via  e-mail at kchakrabarti@arbinet.com.   Arbinet (www.arbinet.com) is the world's leading Internet trading exchange  and switch-based clearing network for global telecommunications capacity. Arbinet routed over 174 million minutes for  international carriers in 1998, which it estimates represented over 80% of all exchange-traded minutes traffic for that year.  The Arbinet Global Clearing Network is presently clearing and settling minutes for all types of communications companies  including Internet Telephony Service Providers and major carriers. Founded in 1994, the company has 52 employees and is  headquartered in New York with offices in Tokyo, Sao Paulo, and Hong Kong.

I had a quick chat with Paul Wallace, as far as I can see this ""informal  procedure"" has been put in place to achieve the effect of credit  consolidation. I wonder whether in fact bona fide credit consoldiation could  be put in place to deal with Sempra and Dapsa (an Argentinian counterparty  where the same things happen). This would involve, ECTRI doing the deal with  Sempra, the deal then being automatically novated to ECT Houston, with a back  to back to ECTRI. ECT Houston would bear the credit risk (and be compensated  at arm's length for this) and ECTRI would have the same economics as the  original transaction with Sempra.  With the informal procedure as it stands, there is the risk that ECT Houston  could have a PE in the UK (UK tax presence), although providing that the swap  back to ECTRI is respected the amount of the income subjected to UK tax ought  to be just the compensation for the credit risk. However on the other hand  there is also the wider concern that other ECT Houston activities may get  attributed to the UK PE (such as the currency desk).

Many of the risks  that were identifiable did not lend themselves to the numeric analysis so  near to the commercial guys' hearts and the numbers we came up with were  close to meaningless.  If you want a technical example of a legal risk in our financial trading  contracts, you could use either (i) the statute of frauds (deals of more than  one year in length may be unenforceable if the confirm isn't signed) or (ii)  the widespread use of multiple ""Omnibus"" short-form contracts for trades  before a master agreement is executed (resulting in many transactions where  netting in bankruptcy has not been tested in court).  Item (i) could be fixed  with legislation (as it has in New York).  Item (ii) could be reduced if the  traders/dealmakers were willing to put pressure on their customers to sign  master agreements.  I like the idea of emphasizing the need for buy-in from the commercial side  in the contract negotiation/formation process.

2022-04-01 15:26:25+00:00,true,1,"  As we discussed at our meeting, attached are preliminary drafts of an  Internet Trading Access Agreement and an Electronic Trading Agreement.  The  first Agreement is intended to be manually signed and reflects the  Counterparty's agreement to be bound by the second agreement (and any other  agreements posted on the website) through a ""click"" procedure.  The second  agreement includes the reps and warranties, limitations on liability, etc.  that Enron will need to obtain from the Counterparty.  I note that the only  reason for bifurcating these into two Agreements is to keep the initial,  manually executed agreement short and ""user friendly"".  It would be  preferable, if you think it works from a business perspective, to have a  single agreement, containing the provisions of both of these agreements, that  is manually executed.  We should consider and discuss the feasibility of this  approach.  Finally, please note that the Agreements reference procedures to be included  on the website.  These procedures will include the actual mechanics of  trading, which the Counterparty will have to agree to but which need not (but  of course can be) included in the agreements directly.

2022-04-01 20:29:38+00:00,true,2,"  As part of the newly started revision of the NPTA terms, a group of some 16  people meet in Stockholm yesterday for a half-day session at the offices of  the Swedish SE Bank.  Since only half of the attendees were lawyers, and just  the SE Bank attorney attending the meeting and myself have any greater  experience from derivatives documentation and trading, the discussion was  initially somewhat unstructured but gradually got on track; and I think I  actually managed quite well in stiring the process towards a decent result.   Minutes was taken and will be circulated in about a week.  In brief the  following was agreed:    An new Nordic financial power trading master is to be created.  This document  shall be in English and be Anglo-American styled and contain all customary  provisions and a schedule (plus proposed collateral arrangements and, if  possible, a short Users Guide).  The intention is not to reinvent the wheel  but rather to collect and seek inspiration from existing derivatives  documentation in different markets.  I suggested that a law firm should be  assigned to prepare the new doc., but the meeting rather thought that the  initial work should be done by a working group (including Enron, the SE Bank,  Eastern Energy, National Power, Sydkraft and Statkraft) and that legal  opinions should be obtained in due course as to the enforceability of the new  documentation in different jurisdictions.  The governing law issue was the  issue mostly discussed and it was agreed that this matter supposedly had to  be left to the option of the contracting parties.  The idea is to have the  Nordic Power Traders' Association promote the new documentation,thereby  obtaining wide acceptance for it in the market place.    Since Enron is the only party in the formed working group experienced in both  derivatives and commodities, this may be a chance for the company, if it  desires, to take the initiative and promote, for instance, something in line  with the ECT Houston Industrial Master.  The new doc. is thought to serve as  a standard doc. for players that is unwilling, or unable, to use the ISDA  documentation.

2022-04-01 18:24:43+00:00,true,2,"  Good morning everyone,  Thankyou for responding promptly.  I think this draft better captures the Master / GTC approach though I thought  we were going to change the title of the Internete Trading Access Agreement  to something reflecting 'Password Application'.    Also the wording which has been added at the end of the agreement is  obviously only US specific - does this mean that we are going to have to have  different Agreements on the page depending on the location of the person who  clicks on it? Obviously the fact that the law is different on the written one  is OK as can be altered by jurisdiction but the same issue does arise on the  online agreement.   This causes issues so I'll need a respond immediately on  this and would appreciate Mark and Justin discussing this today.

2022-04-01 22:09:47+00:00,true,2,"  Western Power Market Stands 'Poised on the  Precipice' According to the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group's 1999 Bulk Power Outlook  FAIRFAX, Va., June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Power markets in the Western System  Coordinating Council are ``poised on the precipice'' of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer  and next, according to a new study of the regional market by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``The West  stands at least a one in three chance of experiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during  the summer of 1998,'' said Judah Rose, a Senior Vice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study.  ICF's analysis of the West points to a number of key near-term implications:        Regional Capacity Deficits. The region is in a delicate supply/demand  balance, with most sub-regions of the West relying      on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet near-term peak  capacity requirements. Because demand growth is      outpacing new supply additions, those deficits will only become more  extreme over the next two years.      Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence. A fifth consecutive  year of above-average hydroelectric generation      -- the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus -- will again  mask the West's precarious supply/demand balance in      1999. However, if the drought conditions of the early 1990s resurface,  the West will find itself at an even greater risk of      price spikes.      Upward Pressure on Prices. Prices are on an upward trend for 1999 and  2000, the result of both higher regional spot      natural gas prices and the increasing value of ``pure capacity'' -- the  value of ensuring reliability for consumers.   The study also evaluates the long-term future of the Western market and  highlights the following key results:        Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily. The region's underlying demand  growth is strong, creating a long-term regional      capacity need totaling more than 18,000 MW by 2005, unless there is a  serious economic downturn in the region.      Energy Prices Trending Downward. The trend for long-term energy prices  is for negative real growth through 2010, but      the region will remain susceptible to near-term volatility while market  institutions continue to evolve and new supply is      slowly added over the next few years.      Capacity Prices Rising Slowly. Current low capacity values will continue  to rise (but still remain below many other      regions) as new, more efficient generation is added.      Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices. Gas demand for power  generation is poised to more than double by 2010,      with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest  subregions. Even so, the West region's vast gas      supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little, if  any, real price appreciation through 2010.   ``The Western U.S. Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook, along with the  other five regional volumes, offers comprehensive insights into the rapidly changing North American power  markets,'' said Sudhakar Kesavan, President of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``No other firm can match our analytic  capabilities -- which are based on an understanding of the fundamentals driving electric power markets -- and the knowledge gained from  working one- on-one with the market's key players.''  About the ICF 1999 Bulk Power Outlook  ICF's analysis of the Western market is part of the 1999 Bulk Power Outlook,  an authoritative assessment of North American regional bulk power markets through 2010. The study also provides the  analytical basis for ICF's extensive and well-respected consulting services providing market assessment, asset valuation, and project  due diligence evaluations for the North American electric power and natural gas industries. The 1999 Bulk Power Outlook is  available for six regional markets -- West, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, South Central, and Canada -- well as a  National Subscription, which includes the six regional studies and a North American summary volume.

2022-04-01 19:00:42+00:00,true,2,"  Mark,  Thanks indeed, as my Englishman rare book finding agent named Paul  (pronounced ""Pole"") Merchant  up the street says, for all the help with the  naval history.  It gets  to swirling around from time to time.  Nelson,  Jack's great idol, smote the hated Spanish and French at Trafalgar in the  18th century long after the Armada had been wrecked at the mouth of the  Thames,  an event that Shakespeare must have been aware of.   I am working  through Spanish history by reading a book by the art critic Robert Hughes  about Barcelona, and did not realize the unique maritime power of that City.   At one time, it dominated the Mediterranean in its time of glory which was  back in the Middle Ages, I want to say in the 7 or 8 hundreds. .  They have  an outstanding Maritime Museum containing examples of those wierd sounding  boats like  xebecs and lateens and, the prize I want to see is the big ship  that some Austrian hero sailed at the famous battle of Lepanto, which battle  is referred to by Cervantes in Don Quixote as the time when Christianity  dealt the hated Turks  a heavy blow.  Cervantes was wounded in the battle and  languished in a Turkish prison in north Africa, some of which comes out in  his immortal tale.  I will not be near Trafalgar because we are going to go  from Madrid to Granada to Barcelona in a triangle but will at some point be  able to  gaze out across the Mediterranean  in the direction of some of those  little islands that O'Brien mentions, I think one of them is called Minorca  and there is a Belarazic or something like that.   And we will see some of  the Pyrennes (sp?) where Stephen had his family castle and through which he  dragged Jack in that bear costume which always amuses me so much to recall.    If you could obtain from Ted Murphy  and send me the current Risk Management  Policy I would be forever grateful.  I like to go back to the text from time  to time.  --cgy    To: Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: Trading Limits    Christian,  I'm afraid you may have your centuries confused relative to Nelson and the  Armada.  The ""Spanish Armada"" of fame was a fleet dispatched by Philip II of  Spain to invade England in the late 16th century - it was during Elizabeth  I's reign and I have some vague recollection that Mary, Queen of Scots had  something to do with encouraging Philip before she was executed.  The Armada  was defeated in a series of battles (and by some very bad weather) around the  English Channel.  Nelson didn't sail til the 18th century.  Of course, the  English and the Spanish had been going at it off and on the entire time and  you'd have to say ""on"" in the early 1800's  when Nelson ""broke the enemy  line"" at the battle of Trafalgar.  I believe that was during a time when the  Spanish were allies of Napoleon - whether by choice or under duress I  couldn't say - and the enemy fleet was a combined French/Spanish fleet.  The  battle is named after Cape Trafalgar in southern Spain.  I'm pretty sure it's  somewhere between Cadiz and Gibraltar so your gut feeling is right - I don't  see it on the map either & wonder if it has a different name in Spanish.   Will you be going to that part of Spain[Andalusia?]?  The English victory has  in common with the Armada battle of a bit over 200 years earlier that it  ended any hopes held by the enemy of imminent invasion of Britain.  As far as the policy question goes, you are remembering what I always  referred to as the ""trading policy"" but is officially referred to as the  ""Risk Management Policy.""  It most definitely covers Portland trading  operations.  I haven't been as involved in that policy for the last couple of  years as I was back when MEH was chief control officer.

The contractor has been selected and the Letter of Intent  has been signed.  We have until the end of next week to sign the full  contract.  The delivery of the project will be 18th September although the  contract heavily incentivizes the company to complete within 14 weeks of now.  1. Agency.com The discovery process has commenced.  During this period we are bringing  together a large number of the team to ensure that the work to be carried out  is in line with our requirements.  Members of the team will be commuting to  the Agency.com office in Dallas over the next week these include Jay Webb,  Marcello Romano, Pat Gogerty,  Chris Dodds and Tilak (for two days).  Going forward, Paul Goddard will be the main commercial contact with  Agency.com and he will be responsible for accessing the correct information /  individuals within Enron as and when required for the Agency.com work.  For  the next week Paul will be replaced by Marcello as the interface during  discovery whilst Paul ensures that the contract is completed between  ourselves and Agency.com.  We are pushing very hard for contract completion  early/mid next week.  The main commercial terms of the contract include incentives and penalties  which hopefully will increase their potential to deliver early:   Delivery of application   19th September  Estimate of costs   $1.2 million +$100,000 for JE  Incentives   $100,000/week earlier than week 14 Penalties   5% of costs/week Exclusivity   18 months (on energy commodities)  Documents attached for information:      Back up up service provider Anthony has told I-Cube that at the current time they are our number two  choice and should we fail to reach agreement on the actual term of the  agreement with Agency.com next week, then we will be contacting them to  continue negotiations.   2. Trading Team Co-ordination  Europe Elena Kapralova Elena has produced initial product descriptions working with the individual  trading groups.  US   Paul Racicot  Paul is working with the North American trader representatives on raising the  awareness of the project, he aims to have details on the products by the end  of this week.  He has also worked on highlighting the requirements such as  staffing and space which need to be pushed in people's minds early in this  project to prepare for launch.  Both of the above will be co-ordinating feeback sessions with the trader  groups on the prototype in approximately 4-5 weeks.  3.  Business Process We now have a fairly substantial team in place for the Business Process side  of the project.  Europe  David Port      Process Leader   Bryan Seyfried/David Weekes   Control / Credit    Janine Juggins     Tax US  David Mally      Process Leader   Bill Bradford     Control / Credit   Tax      TBA  David Port is leading the way with scoping out the Business Process side of  the project and plans to have completed substantial documentation by the end  of this week.  He will be co-ordinating with Dave Mally and a roundtable  meeting on the Business Process implementation will be held in the next two  weeks in the Houston office.  From the OnLine team itself the Business Process is being helped by Arfan  Aziz who is currently tasked with creating a counterparty database to  facilitate the process of enabling counterparties to trade on the system.  4. PR  The approach to developing the site has been agreed with Mark  Palmer.  We  have instructed the agency that they are to abide by the guidelines for the  Enron Logo and get a feel for the Enron style through the intranet pages,  although allowing them fairly free rein with the site initially (up to  prototype and under Paul's watch) to use their creative approach to creating  the site.  Out of interest I spent time with the Design Director this afternoon and the  actual sites they have produced are pretty impressive, here are some examples  if you are interested.  www.british-airways.com www.sprint.com www.benetton.com  Another site which I think offers some of the appeal we would need is  www.vw.com .  Apart from Mark's involvement in the project he has also asked George Tzinas  and Marge Nadasky from his team to assist in this project.  5.  Legal and Regulatory  US Legal Meeting held with Sullivan & Cromwell.  They are happy with the overall  structure of the site conceptually and offered several methods of tightening  the process of binding a customer to the transaction on the Click and  minimising the risks to Enron.  These are captured within their first draft  of the agreements.  These are in first draft format only and have yet to be  reviewed by Enron.  The concept we are working with currently for the US  market are generic language formats to override current Masters.  The current  format which is under review is the idea of an enabling agreement (ie the  piece of paper they sign to register) and then a text book on screen to clock  on when they enter the site.  I am thinking that we should work towards one  document which is much simpler althoughslightly longer.   US Regulatory - We will be involving Steve Kean and Cynthia Santer from his  group in order to ensure that they remain up to speed with the project.     European Regulatory Work has kicked off on compiling the jurisdictional issues with regard to  Europe.  We are facing an issue in that each commodity has one GTC and this  is difficult (for example German Power would be under German Law for German  counterparties and English Law for English counterparties) and we really need  to have a default. approximately 5 weeks.  6.
