While temperatures in the Northwest have already begun to ease, the Southwest was forecast to remain firmly entrenched in heating demand country through Sunday.  Slightly stronger spot gas prices may also have lent support to the dailies.  Balance-of-February contracts were still trading below the dailies, but most players believed spot electricity prices would fall to meet the balance next week as warmer weather prevails.  In other industry news, the General Accounting Office (GAO) said Thursday that it would sue the White House to try to force Vice President Cheney to release documents detailing contacts between corporate executives and the administration's energy task force of which Cheney was the chairman.  David M. Walker, the comptroller general of the United States and director of the accounting office, said he intended to ask a federal judge to order Mr. Cheney to give Congress the identities of energy industry executives who helped the Bush administration formulate a national energy policy last year, detailing the subject that each executive discussed with task force members.  The average price paid for day-ahead heavy load energy in the Northwest rose marginally Thursday on the last remnants of the region's most recent cold snap, as well as increased demand from the south.  Temperatures had begun to abate on Thursday, and the region's major load centers were forecast to return to normal territory by Saturday.  The much-anticipated release of the February Early Bird Water Supply Forecast from the Northwest River Forecast Center showed that supplies in the region had risen from the previous report issued on January 9, but remained mostly below normal on the Columbia and Snake Rivers.  April through September supply forecasts at The Dalles rose from 93 to 97 percent, while Grand Coulee gained one percent to 95 percent for the same period.  ""The report may show that water supplies are still below normal, but there's still plenty of time to beef up these numbers, and we're already leaps and bounds ahead of where we were at this time last year,"" said one Northwest trader.  In unit news, a quasi-official ETR for Colstrip #3 (700 MW) emerged on Friday, calling for the unit to be back up between February 5 and 7.  Since we are talking about a Colstrip unit here, we have opted to err on the side of caution and go with the 7th.  Despite the expectation of gradually easing temperatures over the weekend, day-ahead power prices firmed up for the Friday/Saturday package in the Golden State.  ""Gas came up a little and new month jitters had everyone on edge,"" joked one California trader about the day's action.  SP15 saw the most strength, with heavy load deals heard between 24 and 27.45$/MWh. Similarly, NP15 peak goods changed hands from 24 to 27$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions in the 25 to 26$/MWh range.  Traders said BOM was, not unexpectedly, still trading at a discount to the dailies.  In political news, Governor Davis formally requested a FERC investigation into alleged price manipulation by Enron last summer.  Specifically, the Governor accused Enron of pushing prices up on long-term contracts.  The CPUC reached an agreement with the DWR, which would allow the department to issue bonds to repay the California general fund for power purchases it has made.  To date the DWR has bought $10 billion worth of electricity, and expects that total to reach $18 billion by the end of the year.   On the generation front, Alamitos #4 (320 MW) joined off-line sister units #3 and #6 off-line on Thursday.  Smaller units Huntington Beach #3 (225 MW) and Southbay #4 (222 MW) also exited the grid for unplanned and planned maintenance, respectively.  Friday and Saturday forecasts called for highs to linger in the low-50s mid-state and the low-60s in the south, with overnight lows expected to be in the chilly 34 to 41 degree range.  Predictions for the new week called for near-normal conditions, and the latest six-to-ten called for normal temperatures from February 6 to 10.  As Phoenix residents continued to bask in overnight temperatures in the mid-30s, peak power prices continued to rise for the Friday/Saturday combo. Temperatures were forecast to start warming up beginning on Sunday, prompting traders to expect falling loads and prices next week.  Peak power at Palo Verde ranged from 23.5 to 26.5$/MWh, with the bulk of deals going through at the 25$/MWh mark.  Light load goods at the Southwest hub gained as much as 2.5$/MWh with confirmed transactions anywhere between 16.75 and 19.5$/MWh.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (395 MW) was still having trouble returning from a January 25 tube leak outage, but sources familiar with the Arizona-based unit were confident that it would begin to ramp up at 06:00 MST on Friday (though they weren't willing to put money on it).  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS continued to call for normal temperatures to blanket the desert region from February 6 through 10.

""Prices would have risen even more today, but recent bearish trends have prompted a wait-and-see attitude among traders,"" commented one Cinergy dealer.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures rose on Thursday.  March gained 5.8 cents to close at 2.138$/mmBtu, while April climbed 4.3 cents to end at 2.19$/mmBtu.  Expectations of colder weather in the Mid-Atlantic sent day-ahead electricity prices higher on Thursday.  Western PJM goods changed hands between 21.7 and 22$/MWh, while early deals for Monday delivery were heard at 24.25$/MWh.  Traders said fewer Cinergy imports and more New York exports were the real movers on Thursday.  Forecasts called for little change on Friday, but substantial cooling over the weekend and into the new week.  The most current six-to-ten from the NWS called for above-normal temperatures for most of PJM and normal conditions along coast from February 6 to 10.  Amid cold weather and winter storms, heavy load energy costs jumped up in the Midwest on Thursday.  Into Cinergy pieces for Friday were bought and sold between 17.5 and 19.85$/MWh.  ""We only saw two trades below 19$/MWh today, and most of our volume went through very close to the high end,"" commented one market player, an explanation echoed by most Cinergy traders on Thursday.  Talk also centered on the new MidwestISO that will take over transmission responsibilities on Friday.  Pointing to studies by the Edison Institute and others, most traders thought any changes to the market would happen gradually, and didn't expect any immediate affects on prices.  ""The new rules will focus on generators for now,"" said one calm ECAR scheduler. Next week deals also rose on Thursday, and were heard mostly between 20.15 and 20.35$/MWh.  ""The near term was modestly stronger today,"" summed up one trader.  In unit news, Rockport (1,300 MW) was reportedly off-line for early spring maintenance.  Also of note, ECAR load estimates were up from approximately 31,000 for Friday to 34,000 for Monday.  Colder conditions finally rolled into ECAR, with forecasts for Friday calling for temperatures in the low-30s to mid-40s across most of the region.  The mercury was expected to dip more in the new week, and the latest six-to-ten predicted mostly above-normal temperatures from February 6 to 10.  Anticipation of a break in the bearish warm weather and rumors of units coming off for early spring maintenance lent support to SERC and ERCOT spot prices.  Into Entergy deals were heard between 17.6 and 20.25$/MWh, with prices Into TVA and ERCOT also breaking into the 20s.  Strength in the natural gas markets also cheered traders on Thursday.  Texas temperatures took a dive on Thursday, with the cold front expected to spread into SERC over the weekend.  The updated six-to-ten called for mostly normal temperatures across SERC and Texas from February 6 to 10. ___________________________________________________________   California ISO Congestion Index in $/MWh                           Path                 Peak   Off-peak for 01-Feb-02         NW1 to NP15             0.00     0.00                       NW3 to SP15             0.00     0.00                       AZ3 to SP15            36.22    41.59                       LC1 to SP15             0.00     0.00                       SP15 to NP15            0.00     0.00    OTC Forward Peak Electricity Contracts in $/MWh                      Mid-C              PV              SP-15                 Bid      Ask      Bid      Ask      Bid      Ask BOM            18.25    19.25    21.75    22.75    23.00    24.00 March          16.00    17.50    21.00    22.00    21.75    22.75 April            NA       NA     22.25    23.25    22.50    23.50 May              NA       NA     23.50    24.50      NA       NA Q2 '02         16.00    17.50    24.00    25.00      NA       NA Q3 '02         28.50    30.00    37.25    38.25    36.25    37.25 Q4 '02         28.00    29.50    27.00    28.00    28.50    29.50 Q1 '03         27.00    28.50    28.00    29.00    29.50    30.50 Cal '03        29.00    30.50    32.50    33.50    34.25    35.25  Represents the most recent bid/ask spread obtainable by the Energy Market Report.

Meanwhile, off-peak prices were largely stronger due to the inclusion of the all-day Sunday piece.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the WSCC was expected drift lower through the new week, averaging only 96 percent of normal through February 8.  Additionally, the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting mostly normal temperatures across the Western U.S. from February 7 through 11.  In other industry news, a federal judge has ordered Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force to explain the constitutional arguments behind its refusal to release details of its meetings last year, which included executives from Enron Corp. and other large energy firms.  The Bush administration has so far refused to release details such as the names of people it consulted and the subjects discussed in drafting George W's energy policy.  Peak power in the Pacific Northwest was little changed for Monday delivery as forecasted normal temperatures continued to whittle away at heating demand, though regional demand was expected to remain slightly above normal through the new week.  While flow forecasts for the Columbia River were downgraded slightly on Friday, they appeared to be more than ample enough to satiate regional demand.  Flows at Chief Joseph were forecast to be 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 105 kcfs Monday, and 100 kcfs Tuesday through Friday.  In unit news, Bridger #4 (520 MW) returned to the grid following repairs to a plugged boiler that began on Wednesday, but Bridger #1 (520 MW) slipped into the off-line category for tube leak repairs that were expected to end on Sunday.  The return date for Colstrip #3 (700 MW) was reportedly pushed back until February 10.  Utah-based Hunter #1 (446 MW) was scheduled to come down for 24 hours of repairs beginning around midnight on Friday. On a side note, BPA said Friday that it expects electricity customer McCook metals to restart partial production at its idled Longview, Washington aluminum smelter after a new ""take-or-pay"" contract kicks in on April 1. Several regional smelters agreed to halt all aluminum production back in March 2001 due to the electricity supply crunch in the Pacific Northwest. Several analysts, however, were skeptical as to whether any smelters in the region would be restarted this year.  With little change in the generation landscape, flat spot gas prices at the SoCal border, and normal temperature forecasts for the new week, electricity prices remained steady in the Golden State on Friday.  Light load prices appreciated again on Friday, boosted by the all-day Sunday inclusion and recent trends.  Heavy load pieces at NP15 traded between 24 and 27$/MWh, and light load deals were done from 21.5 to 23.75$/MWh, picking up by more than buck on both ends.  In political news, PG&E released the asset and debt breakdown for its proposed spin-off companies.  In their plan, a generating company would have $5.3 billion in assets and assume $2.4 billion in debt. An electric transmission company would be valued at $1.6 billion and take on $1.1 billion in debt.  Lastly, a gas transmission company would have assets of $1.4 billion and assume $900 million in debt.  However, U.S. bankruptcy judge Montali has not yet ruled on PG&E's reorganization plan, and for fracturing of the utility to move forward, the SEC's approval would also be required.  In unit news, hydro Big Creek Project PSP (1,020 MW) was only down 150 MW, while gas-burner Alamitos #5 (480 MW) came off the grid for planned maintenance.  California weather forecasts called for gradual warming over the weekend, leading temperatures into just below-normal territory for the early part of the new week.  Highs for Monday and Tuesday were expected near 70 degrees in Los Angeles, while northern load centers anticipated highs near 58 degrees.  The most current six-to-ten called for normal temperatures from February 7 to 11.  Peak power prices in the Southwest were largely steady for Monday delivery, but some late-day selling caused prices to end near session lows.  Heavy load energy costs at Palo Verde ranged from 23.75 to 25.5$/MWh, with unconfirmed deals as low as 22$/MWh reported about an hour after the normal trading session had ended.  ""It's still supposed to be cold to start the new week, but the worst of it is certainly over, or so our in-house forecasters say,"" said one Phoenix-based trader.  Some traders believed unit outages could keep supplies a bit tight to start the new week, but that forecasted warming would keep most strength at bay.  Coronado #1 (395 MW) had its return date pushed back once again.  The Arizona-based unit was now sporting an ETR of 06:30 MST on Saturday, but parties with a share in the unit said they had not scheduled with it in place.  Meanwhile, Navajo #2 (750 MW) was set to enter a planned maintenance outage on February 2, with an official ETR of February 25.

To the relief of sellers, forecasts called for a dip in temperatures by Saturday. ""Get out and enjoy it, because tomorrow winter is back,"" recommended one Philadelphia-based energy dealer.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were steady on Friday.  March was unmoved, closing at 2.138$/mmBtu, while April rose less than a cent to end at 2.198$/mmBtu.  Heavy load electricity prices climbed back into the mid-20s in the Mid-Atlantic on Friday, on expectations of stronger loads in the new week and the possibility of a weekend outage.  Western PJM goods for Monday delivery changed hands between 24.25 and 24.9$/MWh, gaining a robust 3$/MWh at both ends of the spectrum.  LMPs appreciated on Friday after spending most of the business day near 30$/MWh, but only averaged 24.47$/MWh. According to sources, troubled coal-burner Keystone #2 (850 MW) was expected off-line over the weekend for maintenance.  The unit was down earlier in the week for unplanned repairs.  Temperatures in the comfortable 60s were expected to disappear over the weekend.  Monday forecasts called for normal conditions across PJM, with highs in the low-40s and lows in the low-30s. The most current six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures from February 7 to 11.  Expectations of early spring maintenance outages and colder weather forecasts affected the grid on Friday, bolstering the dailies in ECAR.  Into Cinergy deals were heard between 18 and 20.5$/MWh, firming up 65 cents to a day ago.  In unit news, Missouri nuke Callaway (1,125 MW) was off-line on Friday.  Quad Cities #2 (789 MW) was at 95%, powering down for a maintenance outage expected to last through the end of February.  Sister unit #1 (821 MW) was still off-line early Friday, but expected to return over the weekend.  Traders continued to keep their ear to the ground, hoping for information on other upcoming maintenance outages.  Temperatures for the new week were expected to drop back into the mid-30s across most of ECAR, with overnight lows in the frosty low-20s.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for above-normal temperatures from February 7 to 11.  With forecasts finally calling for cold temperatures and a stronger gas market, peak power prices appreciated in the Southeast on Friday, while Texas lost ground on little news.  Into Entergy day-ahead pieces were bought and sold between 19 and 20.5$/MWh, while balance of February traded at a slight discount around 18.9 to 19.1$/MWh.  ERCOT deals were mostly heard between 19 and 19.75$/MWh on Friday.  SERC weather was expected to turn cold with the new week, with overnight lows expected below freezing through Tuesday.  Texas temperatures were expected to linger in the near-normal doldrums.  The most current six-to-ten called for above-normal conditions in Texas and northern SERC and normal temperatures in southern and coastal SERC from February 7 to 11. ___________________________________________________________   California ISO Congestion Index in $/MWh                           Path                 Peak   Off-peak for 02-Feb-02         NW1 to NP15             0.00     0.00                       NW3 to SP15             0.00     0.00                       AZ3 to SP15             0.00     0.00                       LC1 to SP15             0.00     0.00                       SP15 to NP15            0.00     0.00    OTC Forward Peak Electricity Contracts in $/MWh                      Mid-C              PV              SP-15                 Bid      Ask      Bid      Ask      Bid      Ask BOM            18.00    19.00    21.50    22.50    23.00    24.00 March          15.25    16.75    20.75    21.75    21.50    22.50 April          15.25    16.75    22.00    23.00    NA       NA May            14.75    16.25    23.25    24.25    24.00    25.00 Q2 '02         15.00    16.50    23.50    24.50    23.50    24.50 Q3 '02         28.00    29.50    37.25    38.25    36.50    37.50 Q4 '02         27.00    28.50    27.00    28.00    28.50    29.50 Q1 '03         NA       NA       27.75    28.75    29.75    30.75 Cal '03        28.75    30.25    32.00    33.00    34.00    35.00  Represents the most recent bid/ask spread obtainable by the Energy Market Report.
