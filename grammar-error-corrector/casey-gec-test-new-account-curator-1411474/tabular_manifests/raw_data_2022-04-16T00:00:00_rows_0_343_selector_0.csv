For those of you who do not know what I am referring to, the  Governor of Georgia, Roy Barnes, wants to develop an economic development  zone right through the middle of the state.  In order to do this he intends  to upgrade or build new infrastructure including roads, railroads, fiber  optics, and a 24'' natural gas pipeline.  There are definite holes in the  proposal, but I thought that you all might be interested.  If you are  interested in receiving a copy, let me know.  If you know of others who  should receive a copy, keep me posted.  The executive summary is only about 20 pages, and I could have copies in the  mail today.  The rest of the study involves 200 pages, and if you would like  a copy of that information, I could get it to you sometime after the first of  the year.  I also would be interested in your comments about what needs to be done for  this infrastructure to be of worth.  For example, it is clear to me that in  order for the pipeline to be valuable, it needs to be tied into other pipes.   It is not clear which pipes or where.  Second, it is clear that if they  expect generation to be built, they will need upgraded transmission and  possibly a bigger pipeline, 30'' (depending on demand).  Please give me some feedback.  I would like to provide some sort of  constructive feedback to those presenting the information.  I have been  working with some of the primary movers on this piece of work, and I would  like to see the project completed.  Thanks.  Tom Chapman  ",Tom - Thanks for the update.

At the same time, they would like to enter  into a contract wherein ENA purchases all of their production (newsprint) at  index prices.  ENA's payable to this company could run to 10MM/ month.  Can  we draft a netting arrangement that would allow us to net the physical and  financial exposures in the event of a default so that the customer would not  be required to post security for the financial deal?  I think we may have  done something along these lines for a couple of Fred Lagrasta's customers.

It is a three month transaction for 40,000/day at the Columbia Gulf-Mainline Pool, priced at the Gas Daily Monthly Index plus $.0125.    The transaction is with the Columbia Distribution Companies:  Columbia Gas of Ohio, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.  I have sent copies of the agreements to you via fax.  The good news is that this is an index transaction, so there is no forward exposure.  The bad news is that, since we did not know about this transaction prior to the beginning of December, by the time CDC contacted us (because there was no nomination made), prices had risen considerably from the first of the month index.  ENA immediately purchased base load supply to cover this, which at this point has drastically reduced the exposure; however, ENA will look to CES to cover the difference between the contract price and the rest of the month pricing as of 12/1/00.  The weighted average price of rest of the month sales at the Henry Hub on EnronOnLine for 12/1/00 was $6.6125.  Since Henry Hub is a more liquid location than Columbia Gulf-Mainline, that is how the transaction was hedged.  The basis difference between Henry Hub and Columbia Mainline (per the monthly indices) was $.05, making ENA's cost to cover the CDC volumes $6.6625.  This makes the total dollar amount $706,800  (40,000/d x 31 days x the difference between the contract price and the cost to cover, or $.57).  Please call me once you have had a chance to review this with the proper CES representatives or if you have any questions.  My number is 713/853-5514.  Thanks for your assistance.

2022-04-16 06:51:22+00:00,true,1,"  Mary, sorry for not getting back to you soooner.  Of the three concepts, only (i) Market Opening condition is proving sellable,  and then only on the basis the it is bilateral and for physical  transactions.  The other 2 concepts:  (ii) modified Market Disruption; or  (iii) suspension of obligations if Enron is subject to  judicial/regulatory/legislative action (intended to address Project Stanley),  are proving to be unworkable concepts.  I believe these latter 2 issues and  Market Opening Risk for financials will be resolved commercially as something  that will be lived with.  The traders/marketers have all three concepts  however.  With repsect to the summary of deals that may be subject to Market Disruption  as a result of changing legislation or Pool Rules, as we previously  discussed, I am not sure where that work product was going, other than  somebody (I believe Lavo) wanted the summary for information purposes (i.e.  as the deals were already done, the risk is what it is).

Please review and advise of any  further comments or thoughts.    It is my understanding that it has been decided that Canada wants to negate  Market Disruption concepts on the basis of changes to EUA or Pool rules.  I  have also negated force majeure claims on the same basis (typically not apt  in financial--however, since it could be argued I added it in the financial  confirm language as well).  Question:  Would we also want to add ""any other  excuse of performance"" to this concept?  Such language would afford a broader  sweep in respect of various claims, however, (i) the sweep may be too broad  in light of it covering any change in the EUA or Pool rules and (ii)  ultimately, we may want some flexibility to argue other points.

Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market Risk  activities.  Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a new  assignment within  EBS, also in London.  The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port.  As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it  is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent  and accurate manner across the company.  Hopefully this realignment will  accomplish that goal.

2022-04-16 07:33:27+00:00,true,1,"  Talked with John Hodge further about the Transco Expansion from Zone 3 to 4  (Mommentum).  Transco tossed out a rate of $.32 (100% load factor) plus 2.35%  fuel plus $.026 commodity.  If you assume fuel on a gas cost of $4.00 ($.095  fuel), then the total rate is $.44.    Assuming the aforementioned rate, Southern Co.'s can pay Transco $.44 or  purchase gas from Elba and backhaul on Sonat at a rate of $.22 which would  netback to Elba at Hub +$.22.  If you assume a basis of $.04 for gas on  Transco Zone 3, then the netback goes up to Hub plus $.26.  Note that a hard  negotiation with Transco could net a better rate than $.44 and that this is  only what they are proposing.  However, I do not think we will get anywhere close to that with Southern Co.  given that they can site generation in Zone 2 (Alabama) vs. Zone 3  (Georgia).  Additionally, most power developers will not commit to a baseload  quantity given that they will serving a peaking market.  Our alternative is  to sell to existing firm shippers on the Sonat system that would view Elba as  a savings on variable cost on their FT agreement.  The net is a Hub +$.10 at  Elba assuming a basis of $.04 at Destin.    Southern Co. has stated that a price of Hub +$.20 was out of the question.

2022-04-16 04:15:55+00:00,true,2,"  I had a good conversation with Dave Wohlfarth of PSE&G yesterday concerning  the proposed LOI.  He had received comments back  from his Attorney (Ken  Caratta) and had 2 issues he needed to circle back with him on.  These issues  concern the process of approvals by PSEG and ENA of the final Order that  would come from the NJ BPU relating to the transfer of assets over to their  unregulated affiliate ""Newco"".   Ken is out of the office today but will be  back in Monday.  Dave's target is to get us their comments late on Monday.   He would also like to have a conference call by mid-week to work through the  document with the expectation to have it signed by the end of the week.  We  need to be ready to update our analysis once we receive their revisions to  the LOI.  Concerning the Filing - a Pre-Hearning Conference has been noticed and   scheduled with the Office of Administrative Law Judge for December 19th.  It  is anticipated that the procedual schedule for comments and hearings will be  set at that time.  Dave would like to finish the LOI prior to the hearing.   We will be participating and intervening in the hearings.  Good news on the Genco side of PSE&G - The NJ Supreme Court ruled 4 to 1 to  approve the transfer of the generation assets over to PSEG Power LLC  and the  approximate $ 3 Billion securitization of  ""stranded costs"" on the assets.   Getting this approve has been important to PSE&G and should help with  precedent on the eventual transfer of the gas assets.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.  - Gil -",I had a good conversation with Dave Wohlfarth of PSE&G yesterday concerning the proposed LOI.

As  we discussed, each of you should make a determination as to what changes in  correlation you should make to offset the decreases in value due to the  change in the model.  Since you have been using the correlation factor to  adjust the values to reflect market, a simple change decreasing these  correlations will offset the change in value due to John's ""fix"".  This  change simply makes the transport model one step closer to properly  reflecting the intra- and inter-month optionality values--Research did review  the change and agrees that it is appropriate.

2022-04-16 02:32:09+00:00,true,2,"  Ned, the table below shows indicative values for the subject transaction.    The assumptions used to derive these values are as follows: ES owns 3.9 Bcf of gas in storage at a WACOG of $2.30/MMBtu. The gas will be withdrawn at a rate of 0.487 Bcf/month starting in Jun'02. In the ""Full Hedge"" scenario we sell futures to match the withdrawal rate  (487,000/month in Jun'02 through Dec'02 and 468,000 in Jan'03.) In the ""Partial Hedge"" scenario we sell futures at an 80% ratio to the Full  Hedge scenario. In the ""w/o Hedge"" scenario the mark would get adjusted continually with  market price movement.  Also, the average monthly volatility and expected  high/low value is simply to demonstrate a range of possible outcomes.  As  these months move closer to prompt their volatility could (and probably will)  increase resulting in larger than stated (but currently unknown) swings in  value.  (Ned, as we discussed, I simply adjusted the transaction value by the  volatility %.  This methodology may need more work.) In the ""Options"" scenario, a significant amount of the transaction value  would be consumed buying [ATM] calls.  Also, I think selling futures and  buying calls is the same as buying puts (synthetic option) so we should ask,  would we buy puts as part of the ""hedge?""

2022-04-16 11:14:14+00:00,true,2,"  Congratulations to the ECP team - we signed the Transaction Agreement  yesterday afternoon!  Thanks to everyone for their concerted efforts in  bringing this transaction to this important milestone.   Financial close of the sale is dependent upon several factors - the most  important of which are:  1.  Rating Agency reaffirmation of the rating on ECP's Senior Notes - both  Moody's and S&P have indicated that they will announce reaffirmation upon our  notification to them of the closing of the sale.  2.  ISRA certificate of non-applicability - This is the New Jersey  environmental condition which according to our NJ counsel, LeBeouf, ""is on  the last desk"".  3.  Minority partner consent at Bayonne - EPG wishes to complete a buyout of  the remaining two minority interests which ECP does not own rather than  obtain an explicit consent to our transaction.  We completely concur with  this approach and have granted EPG (a) an incentive if financial close occurs  this year - $500k price reduction, and (b) an extension to 22-Jan-01 of the  maximum time allowed for financial close.  Though negotiations with Calpine,  the largest minority partner at Calpine, are well advanced, it is certainly  more likely that financial close will occur in early January than next week.  4.  Transition Services Agreement - We need to finalize the terms of and the  specific services to be provided by ENA to ECP on behalf of EPG during a  short transition phase beginning with financial close.  From time to time I will attempt to keep you informed of progress on these  major items.     Attached are two files summarizing:  (i) our estimate of 4Q00 P&L results assuming a sale of the SubNotes to  Condor on 21-Dec and using an estimate of financial close on 27-Dec -    ""ECPmemotable_bka.xls"" (Please note - If financial close is delayed until  January the $500k incentive fee will not be paid to EPG and moving the  valuation date from 27-Dec to 31-Dec will actually increase P&L for the  quarter), and   (ii) an update to the overall transaction results and monetization  sensitivities - ""epgofferanalysis (12-18-00)4Q.xls"" (Please note -  the  estimate of 1Q01 P&L is slightly negative for offering costs associated with  monetizing the swaps; however, under current market conditions it is quite  possible that we could realize a monetization rate better than the forecast  rate of 8.50% and more than sufficient to offset these expenses in their  entirety).    Please call with any questions.     Thanks again everyone.     ",Congratulations to the ECP team - we signed the Transaction Agreement yesterday afternoon!

Latest NFL Player News    Cade McNown , QB CHI -  Updated 12/13/00   McNown will return as the Bears' starting quarterback for this Sunday's game  against the 49ers after missing six weeks with a separated shoulder. Fantasy  owners who have advanced this far into the playoffs should not consider  picking up McNown for this week's game. He is too much of a risk after  missing an extended period of time, especially at this point of the season.      Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ -  Updated 12/13/00   Testaverde has been upgraded from questionable to probable for Sunday's game  against the Lions. He injured his groin in last week's game in Oakland, but  has returned to practice and is taking his normal reps with the first team  offense. Fantasy owners who have Testaverde are breathing a collective sigh  of relief as the Fantasy playoffs near an end. The Jets' quarterback should  have some success this week against Detroit, whose secondary has been ravaged  by injuries.      Dolphins , DT MIA -  Updated 12/13/00   Miami's defense once again showed why it is one of the league's finest  units, holding the Buccaneers to only three field goals in a 16-13 loss.  Tampa Bay's touchdown came on 31-yard interception return by Bucs' linebacker  Jaime Duncan. The Dolphins host the Colts this week, whom they held to only  14 points back in Week 12. Starting the Miami D is a must during the final  weeks of the Fantasy playoffs.     Olindo Mare , K MIA -  Updated 12/13/00   Mare has nailed his last 12 field goals in a row, including two on Sunday  against the Bucaneers. Look for the Miami placekicker to get a few chances to  score this week against the Colts, as the Dolphins looks to put a  stranglehold on the AFC East title.       Tony Martin , WR MIA -  Updated 12/13/00   Martin caught five passes for 67 yards in his first start since returning  from a foot injury. With very little playing time under his belt in recent  weeks, Martin is a very risky player to consider for your starting lineup  during the Fantasy playoffs.     Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA -  Updated 12/13/00   Gadsden caught four passes for 75 yards but was held out of the end zone in  last week's game against the Buccaneers. He faces a Colts' secondary this  week that held him to only 30 yards receiving in Week 12. However, he did  score a touchdown in the game. Gadsden is a cinch starter this week in  leagues requiring three starting wideouts, and should also be considered for  leagues with two receiver sets as well.      Adam Vinatieri , K NE -  Updated 12/13/00   Vinatieri has been one of the league's most accurate  placekickers in recent  weeks, converting on 18 of his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get his  chances against the Bills this week, especially if Buffalo's defense  struggles like it did on Monday night. Unless you have one of the league's  elite kickers on your roster, giving Vinatieri the start is a good idea.      Jermaine Wiggins , TE NE -  Updated 12/13/00   Wiggins has been a real surprise since being signed by the Patriots two  weeks ago. In his first two games with New England, Wiggins has caught nine  passes for 80 yards and touchdown - decent numbers for a tight end. If you  lose Chad Lewis becuase of Philly's bye week and need a replacement, picking  up Wiggins could pay off.      Raymont Harris , RB NE -  Updated 12/13/00   Harris, who was just recently re-signed by New England, carried the ball  only three times for 14 yards in his first game back. With the Patriots  constantly rotating tailbacks, Harris' Fantasy value is in serious question.  It's good idea to avoid all New England tailbacks at this point in the  season.      Troy Brown , WR NE -  Updated 12/13/00   Brown has caught two touchdowns in the last two weeks and is making a case  to be on your Fantasy playoff team late in the year. He will face a Buffalo  secondary this week that has been hurt by injuries, so giving Brown the start  in leagues that require three wideouts isn't such a bad option.        Ricky Watters , RB SEA -  Updated 12/13/00   Watters missed Tuesday's practice with a turf toe injury. Watters was able  to play at Denver this past week despite the problem. Don't expect him to  miss this week's game against Oakland.      Terry Glenn , WR NE -  Updated 12/13/00   Glenn finally got into the end zone last week against Chicago, which is a  good sign for Fantasy owners at this stage of the season. He will get his  chances to score this week against the Bills, who have really been hurt by  injuries on defense.      Napoleon Kaufman , RB OAK -  Updated 12/13/00   Kaufman has a bruised right leg in addition to his quadriceps injury. He  might not play at Seattle, and Terry Kirby might be activated. Randy Jordan  and Zack Crockett would see more playing time with both Kaufman and Jon  Ritchie out.       Kevin Faulk , RB NE -  Updated 12/13/00   Faulk will likely be splitting time with both J.R. Redmond and Raymont  Harris for the remainder of the season, which is not the scenario Fantasy  owners are looking for at this time of the year. There is only one Faulk in  the NFL who deserves to start in your Fantasy playoffs - and he plays in St.  Louis.      J.R. Redmond , RB NE -  Updated 12/13/00   Redmond only saw limited action last week against the Bears because of his  injured ribs, which have taken a toll on his production. It isn't certain how  much playing time he will get in the final two weeks, so it's a good idea to  keep  Redmond on your bench during the Fantasy playoffs.       Cardinals , DT ARI -  Updated 12/13/00   You want to talk about defensive inefficiency? Arizona's defense has given  up an average of 32.4 points per game over their last five games. If for some  reason you've held onto the Cardinals' defesne this long, you're probably  already out of your league's playoffs. If not, make sure to look anywhere but  Arizona for a starting defense.      Cary Blanchard , K ARI -  Updated 12/13/00   Blanchard has converted on only four of his last nine field goal attempts  for Arizona, which has decreased his already low Fantasy value. Being the  placekicker on a team with an enemic offense doesn't help, either - the Cards  have only scored 42 points over the last four weeks. Give Blanchard the boot  for the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs.      Frank Sanders , WR ARI -  Updated 12/13/00   Will the real Frank Sanders please stand up? After three poor performances,  Sanders caught four passes for 90 yards and a score against Jacksonville.  Fantasy owners never know what they're getting with Sanders from week to  week, which is why he isn't a viable option during the playoffs.      David Boston , WR ARI -  Updated 12/13/00   Boston struggled to produce for Fantasy owners against Jacksonville last  week, and will likely be in for another rough week against the Ravens.  Baltimore sports the number one defense in the NFL, and has allowed only  eight touchdowns through the air the entire season. Avoid using Boston this  week if at all possible.      Thomas Jones , RB ARI -  Updated 12/13/00   Jones had 40 yards on seven carries in last week's loss to the Jaguars. The  rookie could see added carries as the season comes to an end, but he still  shouldn't be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs.     Torry Holt , WR STL -  Updated 12/13/00   Holt has a slight hip injury but will play in this week's game.  Expect him  to maintain a high level of play during the final rounds of the Fantasy  playoffs.       Herman Moore , WR DET -  Updated 12/13/00   Moore had a headache from hitting his head on the turf in the Lions' first  offensive play Sunday.  He was knocked groggy, but X-rays showed no damage.   However, if you put him in your Fantasy lineup at this point in the season  his production will damage your playoff hopes.  Avoid using him if you  can.            Alfred Pupunu , TE DET -  Updated 12/13/00   The Lions cut tight end Alfred Pupunu and signed safety Ryan Stewart.  Pupunu, a former San Diego Charger, has no Fantasy value right now.      Eddie George , RB TEN -  Updated 12/13/00   George re-injured the big toe on his right foot during Sunday's game, and  took a pain-killing injection and is wearing an immobilizing boot to help in  his rehabilitation. His Fantasy owners have to be hoping he'll play against  Cleveland, a team against which he has 344 rushing yards and seven TDs in his  last three games, on Sunday.     Steve McNair , QB TEN -  Updated 12/13/00   Coach Jeff Fisher said McNair's sprained ankle is ""swollen, stiff and sore,""  but it's far improved over where he was last week. McNair is expected to play  Sunday against Cleveland, and we can't help but expect good numbers from him  after his impressive three-TD performance last Sunday against Cincinnati.     Steelers , DT PIT -  Updated 12/13/00   The Steelers will be without strong safety Lee Flowers for Saturday's game  against Washington. Flowers is second on the team in tackles and is tied for  the lead in forced fumbles, and has an undisclosed knee injury. Ainsley  Battles will get the start in his place. Pittsburgh's defensive unit hasn't  been posting great numbers in recent weeks, so it might be wise to skip using  it against Washington on Saturday.      Courtney Hawkins , WR PIT -  Updated 12/13/00   Hawkins has lost his starting job at split end to Troy Edwards, after a poor  performance last Sunday against the Giants. Hawkins had just two catches for  seven yards in the game, and hasn't been getting it done in recent weeks. He  has no Fantasy value the remainder of the season.     Troy Edwards , WR PIT -  Updated 12/13/00   Edwards will get the start at split end, in place of Courtney Hawkins, for  Saturday's game against Washington. He had 61 catches playing there last  season, but wasn't as successful at flanker this year. Despite this switch,  we don't forecast good Fantasy numbers from Edwards over the final two weeks.      Kordell Stewart , QB PIT -  Updated 12/13/00   Stewart was given a day off from practice on Tuesday in order to rest his  sprained right calf. He said that the decision was a precautionary measure,  and that he'd be back in practice Wednesday and will start Saturday against  Washington. Stewart has a tough matchup with this Redskins pass defense -  he's a risky start during your Fantasy playoffs.     Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ -  Updated 12/13/00   Testaverde has been upgraded from questionable to probable for Sunday's game  against the Lions. He injured his groin in last week's game in Oakland, but  has returned to practice and is taking his normal reps with the first team  offense. Fantasy owners who have Testaverde are breathing a collective sigh  of relief as the Fantasy playoffs near an end. The Jets' quarterback should  have some success this week against Detroit, whose secondary has been ravaged  by injuries.

2022-04-16 03:19:40+00:00,true,2,"  Mesquite has an internal approval process which cannot be completed until  late this week or early next.  We have slowed our approval process to  parallel theirs.  We will sign doc's when we have both received all necessary  internal approvals.  Signing is now expected to be early next week.  In addition we have resolved the two minor commercial issues mentioned in  last update.  The final price has been adjusted slightly - impact on  transaction value is minimal.   See the attached excel spreadsheet for the  new Annex 1.02 numbers for the Mesquite swaps (also the assumed closing date  has been moved to 27-Dec).  The Merlin issue has been resolved with an  indemnity from ENA in the unlikely event El Paso must pay a make whole  premium on the refinancing of Merlin's $30mm participation (maximum exposure  approx. $675k).  One additional issue has arisen concerning a consent right by the Bayonne  minority partners in the event the Managing Venturer is no longer an Enron  affiliate.  This consent right was granted at the time of the McNair  acquisition and was not part of the primary project documents.  This right  was not recognized in V&E's initial review of consent requirements for this  transaction.  Of the three minority partners, Mission will be acquired in the  next few days by ECP and ECP is in final negotiations to acquire Calpine's  interest by year end.  Consent from the remaining partner, ANP, is not  expected to be a problem.  This or some other work around will be added as a  condition precedent to closing.  While we still expect to close by year end  this new development adds an unwelcome uncertainty to our process.  We will recirculate the DASH, adjusted as necessary for these changes, as  soon as practical.","Mesquite has an internal approval process which cannot be completed late this week or early next.

This information has already been relayed by Joe Deffner to Jeffrey Dellapina.   Milbank has also sent us a closing list.  What we have sent Milbank includes:   1.2- Margin Agreement   1.3- Margin Price Confirmation Letter   1.4- Enron Guaranty   1.7- Consent and Agreement (Enron Corp)   1.8- Consent and Agreement (ENAC)   2.1- Forward Sale Agreement   2.2- Confirmation Letter of Natural Gas Inventory Forward Sale   Additionally, we have sent Milbank a Letter Agreement regarding duplicate delivery of information, which does not appear on the closing list.  We are not planning on drafting 1.1- Assignment Agreement, as is currently reflected on the list.  We assume that Milbank is going to draft this document.  We are also not doing 1.5- Surety Bond; the surety companies will be doing those.  In addition, 3.1 and 4.1- Good Standing Certificates, 3.2 and 4.2- Secretary's Certificates have traditionally been handled by Enron Corp.  Lastly, we are not planning on getting 5.1- Good Standing certificates for Mahonia.   We would also propose that Milbank reorganize the closing checklist so that the gas sale transaction documents between Enron and Mahonia are in one group.For example, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7, 1.8, 2.1, 2.2 plus the Letter Agreement regarding duplicate delivery of information should be in one group regarding the forward sale contract, and all other documents should be in one or more other groups.

2022-04-16 07:56:39+00:00,true,3,"  Vernon, All of these residual charges are the new way that SAP is allocating various departmental costs to our projects.  There is nothing that can be done about this all projects are getting hit.  I am trying to work with Caroline Barnes to see if there is anyway to stop it, but so far I have been told no.  Of course, it is an issue with me because when we setup the work orders we don't budget for this kind of stuff.  I'm working on it but no resolution yet.  The Sheryl Kimes $30,803 was suppose to move to the Science work order, but since we don't have one there is nothing to move to and 12/14 is the last day to put in journal vouchers to move money between projects so nothing can be done except include this in the PMF unless you all want us to move it to your O&M budget.  The original work order had money for hardware for the IT team.  Even if we hire contractors, we must provide the hardware to do the job and so all of our projects must carry burden.  Additionally, I believe that we ordered Kim and Martha hardware out of that work order as well and we did not exceed the hardware budget.  The projects also carry the burden for paying for any technical training or reference manuals that are required as part of the project and that is what the $137.00 was for so it is part of the cost of the project.    Let me know if there is anything else that I can help explain.","Vernon, All of these residual charges are the new way SAP is allocating various departmental costs to our projects.

Worst case is that the dollars will have to be reapproved as outside of the budget.     Likely that we will be able to do some internal moving of dollars to compensate for this, but not guarenteed.

The question has to do with carrying over previously  approved dollars from 2000 to 2001.  The facts ($millions) :  2000 Revenue Management Budget:  $5.7 - Original RM Phase one approval $(1.0)  In July 00, this amount was approved to spend in 2001 (in the 2001 budget as a line item) $4.7    Expected expenditures in 2000 for Phase one.   $(1.0) Current assessment of money not needed for Phase one deliverables (estimated, may still change) $3.7     Amount  approved  with current work-orders $  .8     Possible amount to be carried over and spent in 2001  $2.9     Phase one amount to be spent in 2000   2001 Revenue Management Budget:  $ 1.0   Phase one approved carryover  (in 2001 budget) $  .8  Estimated additional carryover   (not currently in 2001 budget) $3.0 Phase two   ( in 2001 budget  in the Marketing Pool) $ 4.8  Total to be  spent in 2000  Question:   Since the $.8 was approved and is covered in the existing work-orders, can this be additive to the 2001 budget without any further approval - even though it is not currently a line item in the 2001 budget?  Or does the  $.8 have to be offset against the Marketing Pool?  If this $.8 does go against the Marketing pool of $15.0 million, will the revenues generated from Revenue Management  reduce the revenues generated from the pool?  In other words If the capital dollars from the pool are reduced because of RM will the revenues also be reduced?

2022-04-16 08:57:41+00:00,true,3,"  Murphy's Law has hit us the past few days. Since migrating to production we have had the following issues on Capacity Books:  Monday the Capacity Books were not available until 9:45am.   Problem: This was because the Group table was created on the production server and not populated with the initial data.   Solution:   Populated table and reran cycle.  Tuesday the Capacity Books were not available until 8:20am. Problem: This was due to an RTI improvement that triggered a duplicate record on the contracted table. Solution:   Corrected the stored procedure and reran cycle.  Wednesday the Capacity Books were not available until 2:00pm. Due to training we held off on publishing the views on Wired. Problem:  The database server temp log file filled up  and triggered an abend to the Capacity Books batch cycle.  A notification was triggered to Steve         Plant's pager at 2:00am but he never received the page. Craig Buehler  had a problem with the Price Curve Manager spreadsheet, so if                 Steve would have completed the batch cycle the pricing would have been calculated incorrectly.  Solution:    We are automating the Price Curve Manager process, which will eliminate manual intervention. We are also looking into a better scheduling         and notification system.

At issue is whether  a ruling by the FERC on the merits of PJM as an RTO may set an unfair  precident that may affect other regional RTO filings.  In their answer PJM  asks that the FERC not delay action as requested by NEPPS and argues that the  fact that a decision may be precedential clearly is not a basis for  withholding a decision.  PJM adds that Commission guidance as a precedent  would in fact, be beneficial to RTO development.  PJM is also concerned that  a delay would affect the creation of PJM West with Allegheny Power since a  deferal until January 15, 2001 may affect the negotiations and implementation.

2022-04-16 07:30:40+00:00,true,3,"  The New England Conference of Public Utilities Commissioners (NECUPUC) filed  an Answer if Support of the Motion of the Maine Public Utilities Commission  for Disclosure of Information. NECUPUC supports the request for the release of the unredacted copies of  ISO-NE's September 21, 2000 Answer in this case.  In the alternative, they  would ask that the Commission provide to the regulators that are parties to  the proceeding unredacted copies of the ISO's September 21, 2000 Answer  subject to an appropriate protective order.    Duke Energy North America (DENA) filed an Answer that opposes the MPUC  request for public information.  DENA argues that only a  three month lag in the release of confidential  information is impermissible under a prior FERC ruling in the NSTAR Services  Co. case which set out a six-month lag rule for the release of information. Their second argument was that the request seeks information for all NEPOOL  markets and not just the ICAP market which is subject to the suit. If the FERC authorizes the release of confidential information, then it  should be subject to a protective order which contains the following: The information may only be used for the purposes of this docket. Only specifically named ""reviewing Reps associated with the MPUC may review  the information. The confidential materials may not be removed from the NE-ISO's premises. The reviewing rep must execute a nondisclosure certificate.

NUSCO and Select Energy Support MPUC's request for  disclosure of information that the ISO has filed under seal, but opposes the  selective disclosure of this information to the MPUC and other regulatory  commissions and not other participants.   NUSCO and Select Energy request  expedited action due the financial implications and there is also  considerable uncertainty regarding prices in the residual ICAP market in  January, February and March of 2000 due to the suspended settlement pending  Commission guidance.

2022-04-16 03:20:46+00:00,true,4,"  Subject:  Pancakes  Six year old Brandon decided one Saturday morning to fix his parents pancakes. He found a big bowl and spoon, pulled a chair to the counter, opened the cupboard, and pulled out the heavy flour canister, spilling it on  the floor. He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands, mixed in most of a cup of milk and added some sugar, leaving a floury trail on the floor which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten.  Brandon was covered with flour and getting frustrated. He wanted this to be something very good for his Mom and Dad, but it was getting very bad. He didn't  know what to do next, whether to put it all into the oven or on the stove, (and he didn't know how the stove worked)!  Suddenly he saw his kitten licking from the bowl of mix and  reached to push her away, knocking the egg carton to the floor. Frantically he tried to clean up this monumental mess but slipped on the eggs, getting his pajamas white and sticky. And just then he saw Dad standing at the door. Big crocodile tears welled up in Brandon's eyes. All he'd wanted to do was something good, but he'd made a terrible mess. He was sure a scolding was coming, maybe even a spanking.  But his father just watched him. Then, walking through the mess, he picked up his crying son, hugged him, and loved him, getting his own pajamas white and sticky in the process.  That's how God deals with us. We try to do something good in life, but it turns into a mess sometimes. Our marriage gets all sticky, or we insult a friend, or we can't stand our job, or our health goes sour. Sometimes we just stand there in tears because we can't think of anything else to do.  That's when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us, even though some of our mess gets all over Him. But just because we might mess up, we can't stop trying to ""make pancakes,"" for God or for others.  Sooner or later we'll get it right, and then they'll be glad we tried...   Please pass some of this love on to others.            ","Subject: Pancakes Six year old Brandon decided one Saturday morning to fix his parents pancakes. He found a big bowl and spoon, pulled a chair to the counter, opened the cupboard, and pulled out the heavy flour canister, spilling it on the floor. He scooped some of"

2022-04-16 00:10:30+00:00,true,4,"    Kay,  I've been working on the break out agreements for CA Energy Development at Peter Thompson's request (attached).  As you mentioned, we need the site specific information to complete the agreements; however, there are a few additional points that I wanted to bring to your attention:  1.  Please confirm that Unit 17 is going to CA Energy Development I, and Unit 18 is going to CA Energy Development II.  2.  The document needs a fax number for Ben Jacoby and the Agreement Reference number.  3.  I need to get the cost of the dual fuel option so I can calculate the maximum liability amount. (Peter mentions that there's a change order 1.  Do you have that available?)  Also, I assume that we'll simply add the dual fuel cost to the contract value to calculate the maximum liability amount and add 25% of the dual fuel cost to the January payment to arrive at the new payment amount.  Is this correct, or is there another way it should be done?  4.  Also, I need the unit serial numbers if you'd like them included in the agreement.  5.  Will the Retention Letter of Credit be structured differently now that only one turbine is being sold per agreement? (I'm assuming that the figure will be 5% of the purchase price after the dual fuel cost is included).  That's all I have for now.  Peter has been in a conference call all afternoon, so if you've already given some or all of this information to him, please let me know.  You can reach me via e-mail or at (202) 662-3016.

The Operating Guides WG, with much support from Bob Brodie of KEMA Consulting, have been working to conform the ERCOT Operating Guides with the new market structure as defined in the Protocols pending approval at the PUC and scheduled to be implemented on June 1, 2001.  Attached is a zip file containing a complete version of the 'NEW' Operating Guides for your review and comment.   The intent is to have the Guides ready for review and hopefully approval by TAC's newly created subcommittees at their first meetings of 2001.  This message is being sent to the members of the 2000 TAC subcommittees (ES/RSS/TMOS) in anticipation that there will be significant overlap between the membership of the 2000 subcommittees and the 2001 subcommittees.  There will be a meeting/workshop in Austin on Tuesday, January 9 to collect and discuss your comments on the attached document.  The specific location will be provided later,  but the meeting will start at 9:30 and end by 4:00.  The first thing you will notice is a very different document structure and format.  Of note, they contain Hidden text.  If you are using a WORD version earlier than 2000, there are a couple of options you will want to enable to be able to see and/or print this text.  From the Word tool bar, go to  Tools / Options.  Select the View tab and make sure the Hidden Text box is checked to be able to see it on your screen.

Letter Agreements:  Sections 3(a) and 3.(b) of all three letter agreements should be revised as noted in the attached form of letter agreement.  Facility Agreements:  1.  The second sentence of Section 17.4.1 of each of the Facility Agreements should be amended to read as follows:  ""If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the Purchase Amount) is greater than the Proper Scope Value the difference between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the ""Refund Amount"") shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4 below.""  This is the same comment I made earlier.  2.  Exhibits B-1 and H-2 are blank and the corresponding exhibits from the master GE sales agreement should be attached to the Facility Agreement.  3.  The cross-reference to Exhibit N-1 should be deleted from Exhibit I as Exhibit N-1 was deleted from the Facility Agreement.  4.  Exhibit R is blank, however, it is unclear whether this Exhibit is still relevant.  5.  Exhibit U appears to be incomplete and the reference back to Section 10.8.4 is unclear.  I believe Tom Seigler brought this up point up with Ben before Coral left the proposed transaction.  6.  The references throughout the Exhibits to ""oF"" should be corrected to contain the degree symbol.   - 5wtmq03_.DOC","I have not yet received all of InterGen's comments on the documents, however, to expedite matters, I am passing along some additional comments on the letter agreements and the form of the Facility Agreement to be attached to the letter agreements.

The Facility Agreement  is the ""break-out contract"" for the single transformer (LNL 9517-1) being  assigned to CA Energy Development II, L.L.C., in which Enron is presently  selling 80% of the member interests to Coral (the parent of Tejas Energy NS  Holdings, L.L.C.). The remaining 20% will be sold to them after commercial  operations of  their plant. Please have this acknowledgement letter reviewed  as soon as possible.

2022-04-16 11:15:11+00:00,true,5,"  Attached are clean and redlined versions of revised drafts of (i) the Letter Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP relating to CA Energy Development I, LLC and the GE generator set, and (ii) the Letter Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP relating to the ABB transformer.  The Letter Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP relating to CA Energy Development II, LLC and the GE generator set will be in the same form as item (i) above with changes to reflect the proper LLC.  To expedite matters, these revised drafts are being sent to you before review by InterGen with the understanding that InterGen may have additional changes and comments.  In addition to changes necessitated by the substitution of Sweetgum for Tejas, the letter agreements have been revised to reflect the following requirements of InterGen:  (i)  The parent guaranty on behalf of Sweetgum Energy LP has been deleted;  (ii)  A mutual covenant requiring the Parties to use all reasonable efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent as been added to the end of Section 3; and  (iii)  A no shop clause on the part of ENA and its affiliates has been added as  a new Section 17.  The reference to the TRY Ventures International agreement was deleted from the letter agreement relating to the ABB transformer since it is my understanding that the ABB transformer was not covered by Coral's agreement with TRY.  ENA would nevertheless be protected by the general language of the clause.  Although InterGen is still reviewing these documents for tax and other concerns, for now the only contemplated changes to the LLC Agreements and the GE and ABB acknowledgement letters are those needed to reflect the substitution of Sweetgum for Tejas.  InterGen is still reviewing the Facility Agreement and exhibits thereto.  I have passed on ENA's suggestion regarding the extension of the closing date, but have not yet had a response from InterGen.  Doug Pedigo will be tied up tomorrow morning, but Doug and I are available after lunch for a telephone conference to discuss any comments you have on the closing.

Web-posted: 11:43 p.m. Dec. 7, 2000  ???POMPANO BEACH -- The city has returned a $10,000 check to a powerful  Texas-based company that wants to build a controversial power plant here. ???Enron North America, one of the world's largest energy conglomerates, has  proposed a 510-megawatt plant for a 30-acre site south of Sample Road and  east of Florida's Turnpike.  ???Company officials hand-delivered the check last Friday, requesting that  the money be used for cultural arts programs. The city manager returned it on  Tuesday.  ???""While your donation is believed to be a genuine and unrelated corporate  support of the community, the timing of your donation has the potential of  creating a false impression and perception of its intent and purpose,"" City  Manager C. William Hargett Jr. wrote in a letter to Steve Krimsky, director  of Enron.  ???""Therefore, I am returning your check.""  ???The company is planning to pitch its development project to the city's  Planning and Zoning Board later this month. Eventually the issue will come  before the City Commission. ???The company hopes to start construction in April and begin operating the  plant on May 1, 2002. It would be the fifth power plant in Broward County,  and the third largest. ???City officials applauded returning the check to Enron. ???""I think their intentions were very questionable,"" said Commissioner Kay  McGinn. ""The city did the honorable thing in returning the check."" ???""We have been talking about cultural arts. But did they do it for  something in return?"" asked Mayor Bill Griffin. ""The best thing we did was to  return the check."" ???There wasn't anything improper about the gift, said Eric Thode, spokesman  for Enron. ???""The city has a right to its opinion. I would say Enron nationwide has  been recognized for its philanthropic activities. We want to be a good  corporate citizen and support the community. These are not political  contributions. Supporting cultural activities, children's activities, these  are things we have typically supported in various areas where we do  business,"" he said. ???When the company built a plant in Illinois, for example, it also built a  playground in that city, Thode said. ???Two cities near the Pompano site, Margate and Coconut Creek, have  expressed concern about the plant and air-quality regulators, worry it would  rely too heavily on diesel fuel. Diesel fuel releases nitrogen oxide, a  leading cause of smog, which can worsen asthma, bronchitis and other  breathing problems.  ???The plant would burn diesel fuel up to 1,500 hours a year, according to  its permit application to the state Department of Environmental Protection. ???Hargett said in his letter that he hopes when the plant controversy is  over, and the timing is better, Enron will come through financially. ???""Hopefully, Enron will continue its support of the community and consider  a future donation following completion of the various matters pending before  the city,"" he wrote in his letter to Krimsky. ???Thode noted that the check was not written to the city. ???""We would not cut a check directly to a city government,"" he said. ""Our  budget has standards."" ???The check was made payable to the non-profit Pompano Beach Cultural Arts  Foundation, which raises money for city-sponsored cultural programs. The five  city commissioners, who will vote on the power plant, act as the foundation's  directors. ???Enron officials met with Coconut Creek City Manager John Kelly and his  staff Thursday to discuss their concerns about the plant's impact. Because of  the area's wind conditions, the gases from the plant's 80-foot stacks would  blow in the general direction of Margate, Coconut Creek, Coral Springs and  Parkland. ???Kelly said it was a ""good exchange of information"" and he expects future  meetings. ???""They're trying to be the good neighbor and get into the community,"" Kelly  said, referring to the returned check. ""It probably came off the wrong way."" ???He added that he was relieved Pompano Beach returned the money. ???""It gives us all a comfort level we're going to deal with it objectively,""  he said. ""Checks don't make the air better.""  ???Lisa J. Huriash can be reached at lhuriash@sun-sentinel.com or  954-356-4557. ???  ???  ?????    ","Didn't know if you saw this...

2022-04-16 08:05:07+00:00,true,5,"     Pompano refuses $10,000 `gift' from Texas firm that wants power-plant OK   By LISA J. HURIASH Sun-Sentinel??????  Web-posted: 11:43 p.m. Dec. 7, 2000  ???POMPANO BEACH -- The city has returned a $10,000 check to a powerful  Texas-based company that wants to build a controversial power plant here. ???Enron North America, one of the world's largest energy conglomerates, has  proposed a 510-megawatt plant for a 30-acre site south of Sample Road and  east of Florida's Turnpike.  ???Company officials hand-delivered the check last Friday, requesting that  the money be used for cultural arts programs. The city manager returned it on  Tuesday.  ???""While your donation is believed to be a genuine and unrelated corporate  support of the community, the timing of your donation has the potential of  creating a false impression and perception of its intent and purpose,"" City  Manager C. William Hargett Jr. wrote in a letter to Steve Krimsky, director  of Enron.  ???""Therefore, I am returning your check.""  ???The company is planning to pitch its development project to the city's  Planning and Zoning Board later this month. Eventually the issue will come  before the City Commission. ???The company hopes to start construction in April and begin operating the  plant on May 1, 2002. It would be the fifth power plant in Broward County,  and the third largest. ???City officials applauded returning the check to Enron. ???""I think their intentions were very questionable,"" said Commissioner Kay  McGinn. ""The city did the honorable thing in returning the check."" ???""We have been talking about cultural arts. But did they do it for  something in return?"" asked Mayor Bill Griffin. ""The best thing we did was to  return the check."" ???There wasn't anything improper about the gift, said Eric Thode, spokesman  for Enron. ???""The city has a right to its opinion. I would say Enron nationwide has  been recognized for its philanthropic activities. We want to be a good  corporate citizen and support the community. These are not political  contributions. Supporting cultural activities, children's activities, these  are things we have typically supported in various areas where we do  business,"" he said. ???When the company built a plant in Illinois, for example, it also built a  playground in that city, Thode said. ???Two cities near the Pompano site, Margate and Coconut Creek, have  expressed concern about the plant and air-quality regulators, worry it would  rely too heavily on diesel fuel. Diesel fuel releases nitrogen oxide, a  leading cause of smog, which can worsen asthma, bronchitis and other  breathing problems.  ???The plant would burn diesel fuel up to 1,500 hours a year, according to  its permit application to the state Department of Environmental Protection. ???Hargett said in his letter that he hopes when the plant controversy is  over, and the timing is better, Enron will come through financially. ???""Hopefully, Enron will continue its support of the community and consider  a future donation following completion of the various matters pending before  the city,"" he wrote in his letter to Krimsky. ???Thode noted that the check was not written to the city. ???""We would not cut a check directly to a city government,"" he said. ""Our  budget has standards."" ???The check was made payable to the non-profit Pompano Beach Cultural Arts  Foundation, which raises money for city-sponsored cultural programs. The five  city commissioners, who will vote on the power plant, act as the foundation's  directors. ???Enron officials met with Coconut Creek City Manager John Kelly and his  staff Thursday to discuss their concerns about the plant's impact. Because of  the area's wind conditions, the gases from the plant's 80-foot stacks would  blow in the general direction of Margate, Coconut Creek, Coral Springs and  Parkland. ???Kelly said it was a ""good exchange of information"" and he expects future  meetings. ???""They're trying to be the good neighbor and get into the community,"" Kelly  said, referring to the returned check. ""It probably came off the wrong way."" ???He added that he was relieved Pompano Beach returned the money. ???""It gives us all a comfort level we're going to deal with it objectively,""  he said. ""Checks don't make the air better.""  ???Lisa J. Huriash can be reached at lhuriash@sun-sentinel.com or  954-356-4557. ???  ???  ?????

2022-04-16 11:56:41+00:00,true,5,"  I have reviewed the Transformer and Turbine Letter Agreements I received  today.  Transformer Letter  2(a) & 3(e):  why is there usage of ""ABB et al."" when ABB is defined?  Also,  the ""certain agreement"" referred to in both sections is NOT between ENA and  ABB.  It's now between E-Next Generation LLC as purchaser, ENA as agent for  purchaser, and ABB, as amended.  3(a):  have two sets of ""(i), (ii)"" in para.  It's also unclear what this  para actually says.  4:  definition of ""Term"" should go after (b) no?   Turbine Letter  3(a):  Para is clearer than in Transformer but still difficult to understand.  3(f):  Don't understand this para. and what happens with the final payment  due to GE.  3(g):  the ""certain agreement"" is not between GE and ENA.

Letter Agreement for the Turbine Transaction (clean copy and blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the turbine letter agreement with Coral);   2. Letter Agreement for the Transformer Transaction (clean copy, blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the transformer letter agreement with Coral, and blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the turbine letter agreement referenced as item no. 1 above);   3. Limited Liability Company Agreement (clean copy and blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the LLC agreement for CA/ED-II).  As mentioned on the telephone, I have retained a number of the representations and warranties requested by Coral, with modifications where necessary to eliminate those aspects which were objectionable to Enron.  The justification for this is that nearly any purchaser would insist on such representations, and it is often more advantageous to present a draft that appears to be neutral, rather than allow the counterparty to focus on what is not there and then have the advantage of drafting precisely what it wants.  Therefore, we suggest that Enron carefully review the representations and warranties in order that any objectionable items can be eliminated before circulation of documents to the counterparty.  Because we rearranged and reorganized the representations and warranties to make a more clear presentation, the blacklined drafts will not be very helpful fur purposes of reviewing representations and warranties.

2022-04-16 08:13:17+00:00,true,5,"  Due to Rose being out of town, I thought I would respond to a question  concerning giving notice to WestLB, and the preparation of the assignment and  assumption agreement.  The giving of written notice to WestLB may result in the equipment being  subject to the notice coming on the balance sheet.  If there is a subsequent  problem in closing, the equipment is tainted.  I believe Enron has  coordinated this with WestLB, so that the notice period can be shortened  until there is a certainty of closing.  A&K has prepared the assignment and assumption agreements in the past, and I  will go out on a limb and suggest that they conform their form for this  transaction.  We will have a couple of changes in the GE consent and assignment agreement,  based on changes requested by WestLB in connection with the TurboPark  transaction.    I'll make the changes.

ECT's role was to purchase the turbines and NEPCO did the work.   The work has been completed but is still in the warranty phase and thus the  banks want this assignment agreement so that can also enjoy the warranty  rights.

Increase the permissible power level at Gleason on each of the turbines  from 182mw to 185mw.  Specifically, SWPC will allow the three Gleason units  to each have a maximum operating capability of 185,000kw and will reset the  control curves accordingly.  SWPC further will agree that operation of the  Gleason units up to and including 185,000 kw is within normal operating  parameters and operation up to and including this level will not invalidate  the warranty.

SWPC will honor warranty claims currently  outstanding or asserted in the future by the contract assignee, assuming such  assignment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Gleason and  Wheatland contracts.  3.

2022-04-16 02:42:47+00:00,true,5,"  Don -  Please forward on to Allegheny.  In order to facilitate the smooth transfer of the assets, to close out the  turbine purchase contracts, and to provide Allegheny with unused generation  capability at Gleason, we are entering into an agreement with Siemens  Westinghouse Power Corp (""SWPC"") which will effect the Gleason and Wheatland  facilities in the following way.  1.  Increase the permissible power level at Gleason on each of the turbines  from 182mw to 185mw.  Specifically, SWPC will allow the three Gleason units  to each have a maximum operating capability of 185,000kw and will reset the  control curves accordingly.  SWPC further will agree that operation of the  Gleason units up to and including 185,000 kw is within normal operating  parameters and operation up to and including this level will not invalidate  the warranty.  SWPC has agreed to make this change within one week after we  give them authorization.  2.  SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated  warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or  in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the  Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that SWPC's consent to such assignments  will not be unreasonably withheld.  SWPC will honor warranty claims currently  outstanding or asserted in the future by the contract assignee, assuming such  assignment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Gleason and  Wheatland contracts.  3.  SWPC agrees to assist Enron in providing technical information, including  redacted copies of the purchase contracts, applicable technical bulletins,  etc. to Allegheny.  This information will be limited to information which is  currently available to Enron and of a technical nature only.  I believe all of these features are significantly beneficial to Allegheny.   Please ask Allegheny for feedback, as we will be entering into the agreement  by the end of the week.  Regards,  Mitch Robinson","Don - Please forward this to Allegheny.

As you know, the HSR Act imposes a premerger notification obligation for mergers and acquisitions exceeding certain size thresholds.  The amendments take effect as of February 1, 2001 and govern transactions that close on or after that date.  As anticipated, the amendments increase the size-of-transaction threshold from $15 million to $50 million, and they eliminate the 15% prong of the size-of-transaction threshold.  They also eliminate the size-of-person threshold for transactions with a value exceeding $200 million.  Congress projects that about half of filings will be eliminated under the new thresholds.  The amendments also adopt a three-tier filing fee structure, with filing fees increased for larger transactions.  John L.

2022-04-16 11:55:21+00:00,true,5,"  Randy:  Based upon our discussions with Intergen this afternoon, there is a desire of  both Enron and Intergen to execute the transaction documents tomorrow  afternoon.  I need to determine if RAC believes that the 11/30/00 [Coral  Energy] DASH is sufficient for the transaction signing to proceed tomorrow or  if a revised DASH needs to be prepared and circulated for re-approval.  Relative to the approved 11/30 DASH, the major changes in the deal structure  are as follows:  1.  At the request of Coral Energy, the counterparty to the proposed  transaction has changed from Coral Energy to Intergen (or its designated  affiliate, Sweetgum Energy L.P.).  2.  Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to the removal of the  requirement for an Intergen Parent Guarantee.  The major risk (i.e.  non-payment risk) associated with the removal of this Guarantee has been  mitigated by requiring Intergen to fund an escrow account with the  transaction sales proceeds prior to Enron's execution of the equipment  Assigment Agreement.  3.  Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to the insertion of a  ""no-shop"" clause which serves to prevent Enron from offering/soliciting the  turbines & transformers to other parties once Intergen has signed the Letter  Agreement(s).  4.  Enron has requested, and Intergen has not yet agreed, to the modification  of the transaction ""sunset dates"".  These are the dates by which, once the  Letter Agreement is signed, that Enron must deliver the required Facilities  Agreements, GE acknowledgement letter, and fully executed Assignment  Agreement.  This modification proposes that the dates be moved from 12/29/00  to 1/15/01.  The Enron commercial deal team is awaiting confirmation from  Enron Global Finance that the executed Assignment Agreement can be delivered  within these timeframes.  5.  Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to a modification of the  Transferability section of the Agreement in order to address an equipment  warranty risk that the current language represents to Intergen.  The  modification would serve to limit Enron's ability to exercise its ""put  option"" on its 20% member interest in the turbine/transformer L.L.C.(s) by  requiring either: 1) the expiration of the GE warranty, or 2) the written  consent of GE to Enron's ownership transfer in a form acceptable to Intergen.   This modification is acceptable to Enron as it represents an earlier  potential put option exercise date under scenario 1) above than the current  Agreement language.  Please review this information and let me know (via email) if RAC requires  the DASH to be revised and re-approved.  Call me to discuss.

2022-04-16 11:18:48+00:00,true,5,"  Randy:  As I indicated in my voicemail, Coral has requested that Intergen (or its  designated project affiliate - Sweetgum Energy L.P.) be the counterparty that  transacts with Enron.  Based on current information, the structure of the  transaction has not materially changed from the Coral deal structure  described in the 11/30/00 DASH.  Intergen is holding a Board meeting this  afternoon and the proposed transaction is on the agenda for approval.  With regard to the timing of the funding, it is my understanding that once  the Letter Agreement has been executed (target date: 12/21) and associated  documents accepted by Intergen, Enron will notify TurboPark of its intention  to assign the equipment to Intergen (target notice date: 12/22).  Once the  assignment documents are ready for execution, Intergen will fund the  transaction and Enron will execute the assignment documents immediately after  receiving written confirmation that Enron has received the transaction  proceeds.  There is a desire by East Origination to, if possible, book the  earnings from this transaction in fiscal year 2000.  Rebecca Walker (ENA development) is planning to run a D&B report on Sweetgum  Energy L.P.  tomorrow once she receives the State and Headquarters  information necessary.  I traded voicemails with Ben Glisan today on this  counterparty change.  He asked that I work with RAC deal personell on this  matter.   Based upon your voicemail it appears that we do not need to amend the DASH  based upon this change in counterparty.  Let me know if any of the above  information changes your opinion.

In order to facilitate the smooth transfer of the assets, to close out the  turbine purchase contracts, and to provide Allegheny with unused generation  capability at Gleason, we are entering into an agreement with Siemens  Westinghouse Power Corp (""SWPC"") which will effect the Gleason and Wheatland  facilities in the following way.  1.  Increase the permissible power level at Gleason on each of the turbines  from 182mw to 185mw.  Specifically, SWPC will allow the three Gleason units  to each have a maximum operating capability of 185,000kw and will reset the  control curves accordingly.  SWPC further will agree that operation of the  Gleason units up to and including 185,000 kw is within normal operating  parameters and operation up to and including this level will not invalidate  the warranty.  SWPC has agreed to make this change within one week after we  give them authorization.  2.  SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated  warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or  in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the  Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that SWPC's consent to such assignments  will not be unreasonably withheld.  SWPC will honor warranty claims currently  outstanding or asserted in the future by the contract assignee, assuming such  assignment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Gleason and  Wheatland contracts.  3.  SWPC agrees to assist Enron in providing technical information, including  redacted copies of the purchase contracts, applicable technical bulletins,  etc. to Allegheny.  This information will be limited to information which is  currently available to Enron and of a technical nature only.  I believe all of these features are significantly beneficial to Allegheny.   Please ask Allegheny for feedback, as we will be entering into the agreement  by the end of the week.  Regards,  Mitch Robinson  ","2.

Seller shall be required to inspect  the Equipment for damage at the Delivery Point. section 3.2.1 - Seller shall cause the Equipment to be delivered to the  Delivery Point on a DDP basis in accordance with Sections 10.2.1 by the date  set forth therein. section 3.2.2 - Seller shall be responsible for delivering the CT-Unit DDP to  the: (iii) u.s. port of export by any means of transport. section 3.2.3 - Seller shall perform customs clearance for the Equipment  through u.s. customs and pay any import duties. section 10.2.1 Guaranteed Unit Delivery Date - Seller will cause the CT-Unit  (author's note - includes the generator) to be delivered in an undamaged  condition in accordance with the Specification-CT to the Delivery Point (DDP)  in accordance with Schedule I below (the Guaranteed Unit Delivery Date).   (author's note - the date specified in the contract was later slipped per  agreement with enron). section 10.2.3 Completion of Delivery - delivery of the CT-Unit to the  Delivery Point shall be considered complete for the purposes of Delivery  Liquidated Damages as it pertains to the delivery of Major Components  (author's note - includes the GT and generator) when the last Major Component  of such CT-Unit is delivered DDP to the Delivery Point in complete and  undamaged condition.  ...  Purchaser shall have the right to inspect the  Equipment for condition of the Equipment upon actual delivery.  Purchaser  reserves the right to reject damaged Equipment at any location; however, in  the event a portion of the Equipment is damaged or defective upon delivery to  the Delivery Point, Purchaser after making an initial assessment of the  damage or defect and consulting with Seller as to how such damage will affect  the installation , operation, performance, reliability, efficiency, and  warranty of the damaged Equipment may either: (i) reasonable determine that such damage or defect is such that the  preceding criteria is so adversely affected that Purchaser cannot accept  delivery of the damaged Equipment and declare that delivery has not occurred,  or (ii) after taking into account such criteria and Seller's proposed plan for  correcting such damage or defect in accordance with Section 9.5, declare that  delivery has occurred: in the event Purchaser discovers such a damage or  defect, it shall notify Seller of such as soon as practical.  c) facts of the case, as we know them:  common carrier ship carrying the generator supposedly arrived in port of  houston approx. 14jul00.  i.e., that was the ship's estimated time of arrival  (eta). westinghouse is claiming that delivery occurred on or about 23jul00. enron representative (frank cervenka) went to CTSS (i.e., the westinghouse  facility here in houston) on friday, 21jul00 to inspect the combustion  turbine.  during that inspection, westinghouse employees informed him that  the generator had salt water damage at the port.  as a result, the following  monday, 24jul00, he visited the port of houston with the siemens-westinghouse  insurance adjustor and saw the damaged generator.  note - this was just a  cursory visit to verify that in fact the unit had been damaged.  the full  extent of the damage and impact on the project was not known at that time -  e.g., repair or replace were still viable options. enron received formal notification (faxed letter) of the damaged generator on  approx. 18aug00. enron has already made progress payments to siemens-westinghouse in the  amount of 95% of the contract value of the gas turbine and generator. DDP, per incoterms 1990, means delivered duty paid. Westinghouse, despite 2 prior requests from enron, has not provided copies of  the customs clearance documentation.  i.e., we don't know the exact date that  the generator cleared customs, or if it cleared customs. title means ownership, but does not imply either risk of loss or care,  custody, and control.  with title comes both ownership and the responsibility  for payment of taxes.  d) info not known by enron:  when did ship come into port? when did damage to generator occur? when, or if, u.s. customs duties were paid?  f) info known by enron:  generator is a total loss, as determined by westinghouse. per section 10.2.3 of contract, enron was not given the formal opportunity to  inspect the damaged generator until a month after it arrived in port.  as  recalled by matt tezyk, westinghouse was then advised by enron in writing  that the generator was rejected and that delivery had not occurred.   (author's note - matt to find cc of that letter).  g) enron's assertions are that:  DDP was not satisfied.  i.e., delivery of the generator did not occur in  accordance with the terms of the contract. title (i.e., ownership) remains with siemens-westinghouse. risk of loss remains with siemens-westinghouse.  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  john - plz assess the copy of the contract provided to you this afternoon  under separate cover.  we request a legal opinion as to whether delivery, in  accordance with the contract, of the CT-Unit occurred or not.  plz call with  any questions.  regards.  scott.","john - thanx for your time on the phone this afternoon. a) just received cc of letter from westinghouse. in it, they assert that: ""title to the existing generator passed to enron upon delivery into the United States."" and ""the risk of loss passed"

2022-04-16 07:20:42+00:00,true,5,"  I agree with Stuart regarding the preference for the Assignment, Bill of Sale  and Conveyance.  It is a little confusing as to why AE, who was a party to  the original Participation Agreement, is not a party to a change in that  agreement.  This being said, the Conveyance, in my opinion, is cleaner and  has a better chance of being executed in a timely manner, which is the  essence of the property tax issue.  This is probably very minor, but do we need to address any equipment that has  not been purchased to date?  Jeff, what have not we purchased yet?

To me, that is easier and cleaner  (a tax auditor would likely be more comfortable with a simple document that  unconditionally demonstrates conveyance of title).  It is also consistent  with our discussion of the other day (except now ENA is conveying the  remaining interest in Enron Sandhill Limited Partnership (which actually  makes sense)).  Please provide any comments that you might have ASAP.

I believe either approach works.  1. Assignment, Bill of Sale, and Conveyance.  This document transfers title from ENA to Austin Energy and Sandhill in the percentages that they own the facility under the Participation Agreement. It would be executed only by ENA.   2. Second Amendment to EPC Contract.  I have added a new paragraph 4 to the existing proposed Second Amendment to EPC Contract. This paragraph amends Section 7.8(a) of the EPC Contract to provide that title passes when the owner pays ENA for the equipment but no later than December 15, 2000.  Please let me know which approach you believe would be preferable.

Also, on the contract, a number of redlines were required to reflect scope of supply (addition of interconnect piping to cooling tower, unit liability amount, payment schedule adjustment and retention amount, guaranteed performance levels net of all GE supplied equipment aux. loads, guaranteed delivery schedule for purchased options.  This should be ready to go, subject to a final review of the entire contract document.   Regards,  Lee  ","Lee (and others), Exhibit B is the EECC spec, right?

I  chose to run the P&L and take reserves against the estimated revenue because  we have discovered that our purchased schedules were actually cut by the px  and iso.  And we did not know the schedules were cut as the control areas  (BPA, LA, ISO) did not inform us, so we did not resupply our firm sales which  might leave us open to Liquidated damages, once the control areas provide  final flows to the utilities.    We have begun a task force that includes risk, vol mang, real time, and  traders so that we can enumerate the schedules and their values.

2022-04-16 03:09:12+00:00,false,6,"  Per my previous memo Services Desk has a unit contingent sale for the balance  of the month to WWP. The energy is coming from Willamette and services bought  transmission from Pac to move from Willamette busbar to BPA System. Then  Snohomish transmission to move from Pac's system to WWP system.   The Pac transmission is Firm and is for 10 mw around the clock so any off  peak energy coming out of Willamette can be sold at the Pac system intertie  with BPA for no additional charge.  If there are curtailments don't resupply the schedule. Call WWP at  509-495-8534 then PAC Trans. at 503-251-5230 and Snohomish Trans. at  425-304-1620 to have the counterparties take the schedule to zero.   For Enpower the deals are as follows:  WWP Sale         471884 Willemette Buy 471891  In deal scheduling take the affected hours to zero and note that the unit was  out.  Snohomish Trans. 471938 Pacificorp Trans.   471943  In deal scheduling change the delivery point on Pac. transmission from  Willamette Busbar to show it delivered at Mid-C. This will allow the  transmission pieces to be linked together and not cause position manager to  be out of balance. Since this transmission is take or pay we will be billed  for the transmission if we use it or not so leave the volume at 10 Mw.  My Willamette contact is Doug Reiner his cell phone is 541-979-3493 his  office number is 541-926-2281.  I'd like to be called if there are any unit outages or if there are any  questions.

I ended up at a random friend's house at  about 4 a.m., then proceeded to down a couple beers and head for bed at about  6:30. I could not believe it when my alarm went off this morning - it's a  cruel, cruel world when you've got a social schedule like ours. But I  definitely had a good time Saturday, despite the fact that I was ditched by  my ride and locked out of my house, which is never fun after a dozen  cocktails.

2022-04-16 00:03:52+00:00,false,6,"  Real Time Traders,  The Services Desk has sold 10 Mw of Willamette Ind. energy, Balance of the  Month, to Avista/WWP, On Peak,  beginning 12/4 through 12/30. The energy is  unit contingent power  at the WWP system. I have placed copies of the tags  and oasis requests in the Services Books.   I have purchased PacifiCorp Firm transmission to move from the Willamette  Busbar to the BPA system interconnect. Then Snohomish network transmission to  move from PacifiCorp's system to Avista's system.  I have requested that Willamette give Enron a phone number to allow us to  communicate Real Time with their generation staff. I will pass this along  when it's received.   Although the schedule is unit contingent I would like to make a reasonable  effort to keep the schedule whole when Willamette has unit problems. If we  can show that this energy is a reasonably reliable energy source it will open  up future opportunities. If there are curtailments call Pac Transmission at  503-251-5230, Snohomish Transmission at 425-304-1620 and WWP at 509-495-8534  and inform them of the cut and whatever resupply source that maybe used.

If we buy the energy outright from our service  customer (such as with CRC), then we enter ECTRT as the counterparty in CAPS,  and input the appropriate price to pay the service customer in Enpower.  If  we enter the service customer as the counterparty in CAPS and also enter a  price greater than zero in Enpower to buy from that customer, we do NOT  receive the revenue from California AND we pay the customer the fixed price.

2022-04-16 10:39:54+00:00,true,6,"  From Bart to Duke and Chloe  CANINE HOLIDAY ETIQUETTE  (Submitted by a ""Daily Inspiration"" subscriber)  1. Be especially patient with your humans during this time. They may appear to be more stressed-out than usual and they will appreciate long comforting dog leans.   2. They may come home with large bags of things they call gifts. Do not assume that all the gifts are yours.   3. Be tolerant if your humans put decorations on you. They seem to get some special kind of pleasure out of seeing how you look with fake antlers.   4. They may bring a large tree into the house and set it up in a prominent place and cover it with lights and decorations. Bizarre as this may seem to you, it is an important ritual for your humans, so there are some things you need to know:  - don't go to the bathroom on the tree  - don't drink water in the container that holds the tree  - mind your tail when you are near the tree  - if there are packages under the tree, even ones that smell interesting or that have your    name on them, don't rip them open  - don't chew on the cord that runs from the funny-looking hole in the wall to the tree   5. Your humans may occasionally invite lots of strangers to come visit during this season. These parties can be lots of fun, but they also call for some discretion on your part:  - not all strangers appreciate kisses and leans  - don't eat off the buffet table  - beg for goodies subtly  - be pleasant, even if unknowing strangers sit on your sofa  - don't drink out of glasses that are left within your reach   6. Likewise, your humans may take you visiting. Here your manners will also be important:  - observe all the rules in #4 for trees that may be in other people's  houses. (4a is particularly important)  - respect the territory of other animals that may live in the house  - tolerate children  - turn on your charm big time   7. A big man with a white beard and a very loud laugh may emerge from your fireplace in the middle of the night.  DO NOT BITE HIM!!  God bless you! Have a great Christmas filled with God's goodness.
