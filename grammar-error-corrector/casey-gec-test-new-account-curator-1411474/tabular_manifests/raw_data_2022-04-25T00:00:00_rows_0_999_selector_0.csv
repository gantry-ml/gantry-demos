Some audiences want to read; some want to be prompted by beautiful visuals. Flodesk gives you the flexibility to choose how to format your content for maximum engagement.  ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 2️⃣ Use as much visual imagery as you like. Backed by billions of emails’ worth of data, we know that highly graphical, image-heavy emails are not at a performance disadvantage to emails prioritizing plain text. The most important factor in inbox success is designing content your subscribers are excited to get. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 3️⃣ Take up space, literally. Everyone knows I’m a huge proponent of whitespace to make designs more fluid, accessible, and easy to digest. I recommend at least a 40 pixel spacer between major elements in your emails to break up content into bite-sized chunks. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Hop into Flodesk and give our templates a try to up your email designs!

Here’s a particular favourite of mine that lets your mind paint a picture, Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening by Robert Frost.   ""Whose woods these are I think I know.  His house is in the village though;  He will not see me stopping here  To watch his woods fill up with snow.   My little horse must think it queer  To stop without a farmhouse near  Between the woods and frozen lake  The darkest evening of the year.   He gives his harness bells a shake  To ask if there is some mistake.  The only other sound’s the sweep  Of easy wind and downy flake.   The woods are lovely, dark and deep,  But I have promises to keep,  And miles to go before I sleep,  And miles to go before I sleep.","World Poetry Day  It’s that time of year to celebrate the amazing work of poets throughout the years.

That's why we've partnered with award winning mixologist Walter Pintus @waltz16  to show you how to make the most of your cocktail ingredients (and prep for your next cocktail party in doing so🍸)   *Because a #LifeHack shared is a problem solved, is it not?  You will need: A small Tupperware container - mortar or blender - saucepan - oven   Fruit breakdown / deconstruction  Pulp - juice - skin - stone  Using all of the fruit you can obtain 3-4 different ingredients for different uses.  1. Make a fruit syrup with a technique called Oleo saccharum: - this is a way of producing a very aromatic sugar-oil mixture by coating citrus or other oil-rich fruit rinds in an excess of sugar and letting it macerate for 24 hours. The liquid obtained can be used as a sweet base for cocktails.  2. At this stage you can peel off the skins and dehydrate them to make crunchy apple crisps.   3. The pulp left can be blended to make a fruit purée for bellinis or even desserts. It can also be dehydrated to make fruit lathers which can be enjoyed as a snack.  4. The core of the apple is very aromatic and has got a distinct flavour once processed. Dry the core over a saucepan or naturally break it down with a mortar and macerate it in sugar and water (1:1) to make an orgeat or almond syrup. ​ ​For more #LifeHacks, click on through to our website 💻","When it comes to sharing #GinGenius tips, great minds think alike.

Jesse grew up watching his grandfather distribute food and clothing, build churches, and provide guidance for anyone who was struggling. When Jesse's community was hit hard by the pandemic, he was inspired by his grandfather's memory to help.  ""The legacy I want to continue is the values I learned from my dad and grandpa and going out and serving the community. Loving everyone around you,"" says Jesse.  Part of honoring his grandfather is by staying connected to his heritage, especially as he raises his two children.  ""It's important for them to know they are part of this Tribe because it's something they inherited from my grandfather.""

A good time to have your fridge stocked with hearty, comforting meals that you can warm up. Go for dishes like rib-sticking Chick’n Piccata & Garlic Mashed Potatoes w/a side of Roasted Carrots (this week’s Blue Plate Special). Or Loaded Mac n’ Cheese. And get some soup or chili for the fridge too. And some pancakes to wake up to. Then bring on the cold weather - - you’ll be all ready and can stay cozy and well fed! ***NOTE: Since we’re doing Takeout & Delivery only right now, and since it’s January in New England, you can expect that your food will need to be warmed up when you get it home, before you enjoy it.  Crispy dishes like fries, mozz sticks, onion rings do great in an air fryer, or on a cookie sheet in your oven and then gently drained on a paper towel before plating. Mac & Cheese, this Blue Plate Special and soups & Chili heat up great in a microwave. A toaster oven works well for burgers and grilled sandwiches. However you do it, PLEASE do take the time to warm up your VG meal - - you’ll enjoy it so much more.  (Someone gave us a one-star Google review this week because by the time they got their takeout home it was COLD, and it was too far to go “all the way back” to complain. So we just thought we’d officially warn you that takeout or delivery around here in January is prolly gonna be cold! 😉) TLDR: Please DO reheat your Takeout/Delivery orders at home. Please DON’T give any resto a 1-star review saying your takeout/delivery order was cold when you got it home — in January, in New England. 📸: @marciocaxoeiro","Don’t know if you’ve checked the weekend forecast lately, but around here temps are going to DIVE and the wind is going to WHIP UP starting later this afternoon, giving us some really low “feels like” numbers for the weekend.
