2022-04-02 03:07:50+00:00,true,2,"  Dear all,  these are the issues from the last legal meeting that need further attention:  1). European Jurisdictions Peculiarities  Slovenia, Cpoatia, Romania must be added to Phase 1 reviews. Products that   considered are gas and power both physical and financial. 15 Jurisdictions  reviews are already received. So far they do not reveal any fundamental  problems with the overall structure. There are few recommendations on the  wording of PAA, ETA and GTC to come. CC (Tim Hueges) is summarising all the  replies and will forward a list of problematic issues for each jurisdictions  by Monday (14th) lunch time.   Possible complications are:   All documents for French and Spanish customers may need translation into  French and Spanish, as part of these  jurisdictions requirements.   Sweden and Italy have particularly strict regulations on checking  validity  of signatures => it may need to be reflected in the business processes.  It was suggested to have PAA on the screen as well, so that potential  customers may print them out, fill in and mail to Enron.  2). Read Only Access for some customers instead of ETA read only customers have to click on Read Only Agreement,  therefor it has to be drafted ASAP.  3). Product Descriptions A decision was made that they will be reviewed by internal legal team (Justin  Boyd, Mark Taylor) but not CC or S&C.  4). Timetable  GTCs in English should be finalised by the end of June.  First two weeks of  July CC will spend validating marketing data.  Project timetable was promised  to CC to be e-mailed yesterday.  5). Translation Translation of GTCs, ETA and PPA will be done internally . The first priority  languages most likely will be French, German and Spanish.  Actions:  Translations of those GTCs that we already have must be started ASAP (Justin  Boyd to co-ordinate).  Identify languages to  translate into (Elena Kapralova to co-ordinate with  Justin and traders)  6). Taxes Questionnaires similar to the one that was sent to European jurisdictions  must be sent to Canada (Janine Juggins to co-ordinate).  7). Web Page Wording The words ""I accept"" and ""Delete"" in the box that appears after a customer  clicked on price, are to be changed into ""Submit"" and ""Clear"". Lawyers are  comfortable with this.  8). Different Entities on Counterparty Side If there are a few different entities trading for the same company,  for ex.  Morgan Stanley International (MSI) and Morgan Stanley (MS), they should be  treated in the system as two separate clients and be granted two separate  System Administrator passwords. This is necessary for tax considerations. It  is confirmed once again that there will be one ETA acceptance click per  System Administrator.  9). Authorisation Risk  Because Online Trading will be Enron's software, all problems arising from  authorisation errors, for ex.  when customer that was supposedly authorised  to trade only UK Gas was able to trade power, will be entirely Enron's  liability => it highlights again an importance of very thorough testing of  authorisation functionality of the system in July and August.  10). Written and Electronic Confirmations It appears to be a difference between UK and US practices in treating  superiority of written vs. electronic confirmations. According to the UK law,  an electronic confirmation will overwrite a paper one, generated and mailed  by the Back Office, similar to the current practice for transactions done  over the telephone, when phone conversation overwrites all paper  conformations. In the US the situation is opposite. For the deals done over  the phone, written confirmations still take priority over the phone  conversation tape. In Texas anything that is not in writing, is not  enforceable.  The situation with priority of confirmations of Online trades in US must be  investigated further (Mark Taylor to co-ordinate). The result should be  reflected in US version of  ETA.   This leads to a further question, whether sending written confirmations in UK  is still necessary?  11). UN E-Commerce Directive There is a daft of UN Directive on e-commerce, which currently has very  strict rules regarding time when transaction is considered complete. It  requires mutual exchange of written confirmations etc. Enron might be in  position to lobby few items in this Directive (Justin and Regulatory Dept.)   12). Suspending Trades by Counterparty A few traders are very keen on being able to suspend trades by counterparty,  for instance in a situation when they see a counterparty making a number of  deals in the same commodity. It arises two issues: IT -  the system should be able to put a name of the counterparty on the  transaction summary page (bottom of the price page)   Legal - CC has to investigate and give a view whether it is permitted by law.   Price Check Idea  Just a thought, whether  it is technically possible to amend a price check  (the one done when the customer submitted a price, and database does credit,  GTC and price check) in a way that customer is notified about the price  change not for all changes but only when the price has moved against Enron,  i.e. if price moved in Enron's  favour transaction should go forward at the  price customer had agreed to earlier. Legally it is OK. Jay, can the system  do it?   Internal Issues still to be addressed:  1). Global Liquids Books management, i.e. how responsibilities for price  update will be managed  between London and Houston desks. 2). FX conversion including IT, business processes, tax, risk managment  issues (David Port, Janine Juggins, Jay Webb)  All comments are welcome, Regards, Elena        ","4. Actions: Translations for GTCs in the European Jurisdictions. The subjects included are gas and power, both physical and financial. 15 Jurisdictions reviews have already been received, and a number of new applications may be received by CC by Monday (14th).

It's quickly becoming one of the world's largest traded commodities, yet it's one of the last to be bought and sold over the Internet. But that's about to change today when Houston Street Exchange introduces HoustonStreet.com, a new online electric power trading floor that allows power traders to buy and sell electricity faster and better than before. Houston Street Exchange hopes to do for the power industry what E rade did for the stock market: turn the industry upside down by bringing together buyers and sellers in a real-time, efficient online format. This will shift the control of the $70 billion wholesale power market in the United States by putting it directly into the hands of power marketers, utilities and other traders that are entering the increasingly deregulated energy market. HoustonStreet.com serves as a portal for power traders, providing critical information regarding weather, energy news, stocks and other direct links necessary for trading electricity. HoustonStreet.com is pioneering the emerging business-to-business e-commerce power trading market. Lights out for phones, static Web sites HoustonStreet.com delivers what has so far been elusive to the power trader: an easy-to-use, fully Web-based trading floor that gives power traders all the information and flexibility they need to post offers, make bids, counter and re-counter instantaneously, until they close the deal. Historically, power marketers have attempted to finalize deals while juggling numerous phones and praying no one is undercutting their transactions because they can't see a real-time picture of market pricing. They lose precious time because they must call around to get the latest market prices.  HoustonStreet.com eliminates that by giving power traders instant access to current pricing fluctuations in different regional power markets. ""The real-time environment of the Web naturally lends itself to trading wholesale power,"" said Paul Messerschmidt, manager of Power Markets Services at Energy Security Analysis, Inc. ""But existing online products are inflexible and they typically require proprietary hardware or software to operate.  Until these issues are rectified, wholesale power trading online will remain dormant. Houston Street Exchange is positioning itself as the industry's wake-up call by providing a secure, reliable and flexible platform that allows traders to trade power the same way they do today, but more efficiently."" HoustonStreet.com enables traders to make deals based on the product and term of their choice, providing them the flexibility to buy and sell the same way they do now, only utilizing a much more efficient and easy-to-use medium-the Internet. ""The leadership of Houston Street Exchange has a vision for changing the power marketing industry"" said Alan Herrick, senior vice president at Sapient Corporation (NASDAQ: SAPE) the e-services consultancy that helped create HoustonStreet.com. ""They understand the importance of first-mover advantage and the need to continually provide a world-class experience for their targeted market.  Sapient is delighted to be Houston Street's partner."" Built with power traders in mind Designed by power traders for power traders, HoustonStreet.com enables users to maintain total control over each transaction, view their complete trading history, sort offers and bids by price, term, volume and delivery point, and trade 24 hours a day, 365 days a year using an online service that ensures the security and anonymity of each transaction. Easy to access, navigate and use, HoustonStreet.com gives traders up-to-the-second market information, allowing them to make the best deals at the right time without having to leave the site.  Traders are able to customize their Web page so they can see information that may impact decisions on trading strategy such as updated weather reports, news headlines about the energy industry and stock prices. HoustonStreet.com provides users with the ability to enter their own information regarding trading agreements and credit status without betraying the anonymity of other parties. Knowing whether an enabling agreement is in place and credit issues have been resolved beforehand gives a power marketer a tremendous advantage in making split-second decisions. Because of its ease of use and real-time environment, HoustonStreet.com will allow power traders to make more transactions and become more efficient. HoustonStreet.com will initially cover the Northeast regions (NEPOOL, PJM, NY) and expects to roll out the remaining trading regions of the country over the next several months. ""Wholesale power trading in the United States has grown by about 900 percent since 1996. In 1998, more than 3.0 billion megawatt hours were traded, with virtually all of it done over the telephone,"" said Frank Getman, Houston Street Exchange's president and CEO. ""We are redefining how power is traded in the wholesale market, making it much more efficient and easy for power marketers to buy and sell electricity. HoustonStreet.com represents a powerful convergence of two major trends: growth of business-to-business e-commerce and deregulation of the electric power industry.""

2022-04-02 01:48:25+00:00,true,2,"  Gentlemen:  In connection with an analysis of the tax issues presented by the E-commerce  program, it is important that all Enron entities to participate in such  system (as well the products to be traded by such entities) be compiled.   London has undertaken this with respect to Europe (and, shortly, Singapore).   I have undertaken to coordinate this with respect to North America.  Thus, if  you could send me a list of North American Enron entities to be incorporated  in the E-commerce program (and the products they will trade) I can then  undertake to determine what issues such presents.  In this regard, I will  coordinate with ECT-Legal in North America to verify that the manner such  entities are to be incorporated into the E-commerce program does not trigger  unplanned for tax consequences.  In addition, it would be helpful to obtain copies of the form of agreements  to be entered into by counterparties prior to such parties being granted  access to the E-commerce system (i.e., the form of on-line access agreements  and any agreements ancilliary thereto).  These agreements are important to  the tax analysis of the E-commerce program because the manner such agreements  are to be entered into may implicate tax nexus concerns that we will want to  work to mitigate (for example, if it is contemplated that all such on-line  agreements are to be administratively executed by a single entity  (""Administrative Entity"") on behalf of each Enron trading entity  participating in the E-commerce system, such process could expose the Enron  trading entity to tax exposure in the jurisdiction in which the  Administrative Entity is located - obviously, this may be more complicated if  it is uncertain where such Administrative Entity is located).  Finally, it is understood that the manner in which trading is to be effected  through the E-commerce system is such that the Enron trading entity  established as the entity to trade with a particular counterparty will be the  only such Enron entity transacting business with such counterparty.  In this  regard, therefore, it is not contemplated that one Enron trading entity will  transact in part with a counterparty and that another Enron trading entity  will complete such trade (for example, it will not be possible for a  counterparty to obtain an agreement with respect to a particular product with  EEL that will then be supplied by ECT - though this may occur on occasion in  a fashion no different that is currently the case).  Please notify me in the  event that this understanding is not correct so that we can plan to mitigate  the potential tax issues that will be raised if trading is to occur otherwise  (in this regard, as was discussed on Tuesday with Dave Mally and David Port,  if a trade is transacted in a manner whereby one Enron entity executes a  transaction and fulfills the requirements of such by purchasing inventory  from another Enron entity, the income derived in such transaction is  potentially subject to taxation in multiple tax jurisdictions).  Please contact either myself at x30938 or, if I am unavailable, Jeff  Blumenthal at x35777 in Houston with any follow-up questions.  Best regards.","Gentlemen: In connection with an analysis of the tax issues presented by the E-commerce program, it is important that all Enron entities to participate in such system (as well as the products to be traded by such entities) be compiled.

From what we see in the document looks like we need to:  work on the wording of the preamble make ""two-way"" protecting our terms and conditions etc. add agreement term add ""confidentiality"" term define ""products"" require their signature  Comments???

European Jurisdictions Peculiarities  Slovenia, Cpoatia, Romania must be added to Phase 1 reviews. Products that   considered are gas and power both physical and financial. 15 Jurisdictions  reviews are already received. So far they do not reveal any fundamental  problems with the overall structure. There are few recommendations on the  wording of PAA, ETA and GTC to come. CC (Tim Hueges) is summarising all the  replies and will forward a list of problematic issues for each jurisdictions  by Monday (14th) lunch time.   Possible complications are:   All documents for French and Spanish customers may need translation into  French and Spanish, as part of these  jurisdictions requirements.   Sweden and Italy have particularly strict regulations on checking  validity  of signatures => it may need to be reflected in the business processes.  It was suggested to have PAA on the screen as well, so that potential  customers may print them out, fill in and mail to Enron. YES - only in the  garden and we will need clear instrucutions on how to register there also   2). Read Only Access for some customers instead of ETA read only customers have to click on Read Only Agreement,  therefor it has to be drafted ASAP. DRAFTING REQUIRED. THIS IS ALSO A SYSTEM  REQUIREMENT FOR READ ONLY.  3). Product Descriptions A decision was made that they will be reviewed by internal legal team (Justin  Boyd, Mark Taylor) but not CC or S&C. OK  4). Timetable  GTCs in English should be finalised by the end of June.  First two weeks of  July CC will spend validating marketing data.  Project timetable was promised  to CC to be e-mailed yesterday.  OK, but timings will vary on the basis of  what timetable says.  5). Translation Translation of GTCs, ETA and PPA will be done internally . The first priority  languages most likely will be French, German and Spanish.  Actions:  Translations of those GTCs that we already have must be started ASAP (Justin  Boyd to co-ordinate).   Identify languages to  translate into (Elena Kapralova to co-ordinate with  Justin and traders)  6). Taxes Questionnaires similar to the one that was sent to European jurisdictions  must be sent to Canada (Janine Juggins to co-ordinate).  7). Web Page Wording The words ""I accept"" and ""Delete"" in the box that appears after a customer  clicked on price, are to be changed into ""Submit"" and ""Clear"". Lawyers are  comfortable with this.  8). Different Entities on Counterparty Side If there are a few different entities trading for the same company,  for ex.  Morgan Stanley International (MSI) and Morgan Stanley (MS), they should be  treated in the system as two separate clients and be granted two separate  System Administrator passwords. This is necessary for tax considerations. It  is confirmed once again that there will be one ETA acceptance click per  System Administrator.  9). Authorisation Risk  Because Online Trading will be Enron's software, all problems arising from  authorisation errors, for ex.  when customer that was supposedly authorised  to trade only UK Gas was able to trade power, will be entirely Enron's  liability => it highlights again an importance of very thorough testing of  authorisation functionality of the system in July and August.NO this would  only be the case if we reverted to asking them what they wanted to trade and  we are not going to do that from a systems process point of view - DAVID _  ISSUE  10). Written and Electronic Confirmations It appears to be a difference between UK and US practices in treating  superiority of written vs. electronic confirmations. According to the UK law,  an electronic confirmation will overwrite a paper one, generated and mailed  by the Back Office, similar to the current practice for transactions done  over the telephone, when phone conversation overwrites all paper  conformations. In the US the situation is opposite. For the deals done over  the phone, written confirmations still take priority over the phone  conversation tape. In Texas anything that is not in writing, is not  enforceable.    The situation with priority of confirmations of Online trades in US must be  investigated further (Mark Taylor to co-ordinate). The result should be  reflected in US version of  ETA. YES  This leads to a further question, whether sending written confirmations in UK  is still necessary?YES  11). UN E-Commerce Directive There is a daft of UN Directive on e-commerce, which currently has very  strict rules regarding time when transaction is considered complete. It  requires mutual exchange of written confirmations etc. Enron might be in  position to lobby few items in this Directive (Justin and Regulatory Dept.)  What th eEU piece asks for is mutual confirmations by clicking - two further  stages than we have in our system.  WE need to build a system which can  incorporate these changes at some point in the furture but not now.  12). Suspending Trades by Counterparty A few traders are very keen on being able to suspend trades by counterparty,  for instance in a situation when they see a counterparty making a number of  deals in the same commodity. It arises two issues: IT -  the system should be able to put a name of the counterparty on the  transaction summary page (bottom of the price page) YES   Legal - CC has to investigate and give a view whether it is permitted by law.  NO PROBLEM - BUILD SYSTEM NOW TO DO THIS.   Price Check Idea  Just a thought, whether  it is technically possible to amend a price check  (the one done when the customer submitted a price, and database does credit,  GTC and price check) in a way that customer is notified about the price  change not for all changes but only when the price has moved against Enron,  i.e. if price moved in Enron's  favour transaction should go forward at the  price customer had agreed to earlier. Legally it is OK. Jay, can the system  do it? YES  Internal Issues still to be addressed:  1). Global Liquids Books management, i.e. how responsibilities for price  update will be managed  between London and Houston desks.DAVID 2). FX conversion including IT, business processes, tax, risk managment  issues (David Port, Janine Juggins, Jay Webb)DAVID  All comments are welcome, Regards, Elena           ","Elena Kapralova 09/06/99 14:26 To: Louise Kitchen/LON/ECT@ECT, Janine Juggins/LON/ECT@ECT, Justin Boyd/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark - Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Marc"
2022-04-02 12:16:27+00:00,true,2,"  Elizabeth Sager, who is responsible for power trading documentation in North  America and was in large part responsible for drafting the Industrial Master  several years ago, is reviewing the proposed form.  She will have comments  for us by Monday morning, Houston time.     Martin Rosell 06/22/99 09:04 AM To: Paul Simons/LON/ECT@ECT, Matthew Landy/LON/ECT@ECT, Tomas  Valnek/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Edmund Cooper/LON/ECT@ECT, Scott Sefton/LON/ECT@ECT, Justin  Boyd/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Elliott/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark - ECT Legal  Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thor Lien/OSL/ECT@ECT  Subject: Draft Nordic Power Master Agreement  Please find attached a copy of the above document, marked to show changes  from the draft of S&M, together with a clean copy thereof (please disregard  any layout or file format deficiencies).  Besides further streamlining and  refining of the doc, I've also styled it somewhat differently why it, on the  face of the mark-ups, may appear even more amended than is the case.  I've chosen to call the doc. 'Nordic Power Master Agreement' and inserted the  Norwegian name of the Nordic Power Traders Association (""NPTA"") in the header  (hopefully, NPTA will be prepared to launch and market the doc. in its own  name).  I've also prepared a brief Schedule addressing the optionality  offered by the document.  The document is originally based upon ECT's  Industrial Master Agreement.  In the Industrial Agreement, terms such as ""the  Contract"", ""this Contract"", ""this Agreement"" and ""the Agreement"" are used  interchangeably and not always with great preciseness.  In the attached  document the terms ""this Master Agreement"" or ""this Agreement"" are used  consistently (the latter to include all Transactions).  These are my remarks  to the (principal) changes made, and to some issues that the new doc gives  rise to:  1.  Transactions.    I've introduced some ISDA wordings herein (for example, the ""Inconsistency""  provisions) and deleted text that I find less appropriate or necessary in the  current context.  2.  Obligations  This is a critical Section since it also refers to products for which there  currently are no NPTA documentation (""Options"" and ""Collars"").  When I  discussed this with the Nordic trading desk it sounded less thrilled about us  expanding the current Nordic bilateral power contracts range, and I have  therefore left references to options (other than swaptions and Asian options)  within square brackets (including related definitions).  (Supposedly, this  will be something for the Working Group, Reference Group and the NPTA to  determine.)  I've expanded the text on SWAPs and included a brief reference  to ASIAN (options) and also streamlined the Tax clause.   3.  Representation  Reps are not particularly common in Nordic law contracts.  The ""No Reliance""  reps appear to be typically American and may not be to everyone's taste.   Since parties seldom are prepared to give ""Payee"" reps I've cut out that part  and also taken out the ""Payer"" reps as something that we should be able to do  without.   I also feel a bit hesitant towards S&M's proposed ""Changes in  Representation"" and therefore rubbed that one out as well (whilst being at  it).  4.  Market Disruption  Since the underlying reference price (Nord Pool's spot price) is quoted on an  hourly basis, some wordings have been included to reflect that.  5.  Events of Default  I'm mostly concerned about the cross-default clause.  Insofar as ECTRIC (and  its possible Credit Support Provider) is concerned, we may, in this  particular context, lose more than we gain from a cross default provision.   Also, the cross default  also only appears to apply to ""borrowed money"" (and  ""such obligation"") and not default under any other ""specified transactions"".   It's worth considering making cross default optional and part of the Schedule  instead.  6.  Remedies  As the enforceability of close-out netting in certain jurisdictions may  require the automatic termination of all Transactions, it's  necessary to  offer the parties the choice of ""Automatic Early Termination"" in the Schedule.  7.  Events of Change  I've followed the route of the Nordic 'Amendment Agreement' and pulled  together ""Events of  Change"" and ""Change in Tax Law"" and done my best to  streamline this sections since it undoubtedly will raise questions from local  players in due course.  (The former sections 8 (Credit Support), 9 (Set-off) and 10 (Confidentiality)  have been edited out.  The former because of the streamlining of the credit  provisions (and related definitions) and the two latter since those concern  issues that rather should be addressed by the parties bilaterally.)  8.  Governing Law and Jurisdiction  As previously discussed, this part is something for the parties to agree upon  in the Schedule.  9.  Documents  As above under 8.  10.  Miscellaneous  I've crossed out the former ""Currency Provisions"" since it won't be  enforceable in certain jurisdictions.  (Might be something for the Schedule.)  11.  Definitions  Some of the credit terms have been stricken out.  With reference to my  earlier comment with respect to the uncertainty relating to the inclusion  into the document of further options instruments, the related terms defined  are in between square brackets.  Some of the defined terms may need to be  further refined to better reflect the products, trading routines and  settlement mechanisms in the Nordic Electricity market.  Exhibit A   The relevant details can be found in the Schedule.  ----------------------------------------------------  Please return with any comments you may have before close of business on  Thursday (Oslo time).

2022-04-02 05:41:18+00:00,true,2,"  Attached is the form of schedule to the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement we use for  purely financial transactions - swaps and options.  There are a large number  of choices and variables to consider in these documents and usually whenever  an Enron company begins financial trading in a new jurisdiction we work with  local counsel to adapt the form and then handle most of the drafting and  negotiating from here.  To the extent you are interested in using ISDA Master  Agreements, we will be happy to continue in the same way.  I'm not sure they  will be much help in constructing the type of physical commodity agreements I  suspect you need.  If you need the printed form of the ISDA Master that the  schedule relates to, let me know and I can have it faxed to you.  When the transaction is physical, even if there is an embedded swap or option  of some kind, we use physical commodity contracts which vary widely from  commodity to commodity.  I will ask Elizabeth Sager to send you some sample  electricity forms and Jeff Hodge or Dan Hyvl to send some natural gas forms.   In a trading context, since Enron may be on either side of one or more  transactions with the same counterparty, the forms are drafted in a bilateral  fashion (basically we only ask for thing we are willing to give).  If your  situation is different (e.g. our transactions with one party involve only the  purchase of fuel and with another party only selling electricity, dramatic  changes to these forms might be in order.  With regard to loan/finance transactions, I am not at all familiar with forms  they use and in fact those transactions may be individualized to the extent  that they don't even use forms as such.  I will ask Julia Murray to contact  you or have one of the people in her group get in touch with you to talk  about those types of transactions.  Unfortunately, I don't know of an  electronic table of contents to the forms.  There is a project underway to  create a forms database but it is in the very early stages of thought.

Of course these forms would be used as a guideline and would be adapted as needed to comply with local laws. We would  be interested in any electronic copies of any ECT forms where (i) Enron is a  party to either side of a physical or financial swap (fuel and/or electric), (ii) Enron is a party to fuel or electricity supply agreements (interruptible or firm), (iii) Enron is a party to loan/finance documents, and (iv) Enron is a party to construction /O&M Agreements.

Andrew.Wilkinson@cliffordchance.com cc:   Subject: Registration Process Questions  Last two days showed that there is a big confusion on how exactly the  registration process is going to work. The issue is very important and urgent  as it may cause changes to the scope for Agency.com, and changes in the ETA  and PA documents text.   The registration process appears to differ for different customer groups and,  to my understanding, the latest was agreed as below. Please provide your  comments or any corrections to the following:  1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)  will receive marketing Pack via mail approx. 2 weeks before the system goes  live. The Marketing Pack will include PA (for an appropriate jurisdiction)  and Registration Forms with questions about the customer (name, address,  e-mail, taxable entity etc.)  customers will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron After the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive  IDs and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual  traders in that company The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept  ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all  other users.  Q:  Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the  ""House""?   2. Guest Users ( also referred to as Read Only Users) - Regulators, Lawyers,  Brokers, Potential Traders etc.  will phone or sent e-mail (possibly fill in a form online, that will be  automatically e-mailed) to Enron System Administrator. Customers will provide  info on their name, e-mail address, mailing address, country of incorporation  etc. If Enron approves the customer as a Guest user, the System Administrator will  e-mail customer Guest ID and Password. When the customer logs in for the  first time as a guest, it'll  have to  accept Read Only ETA on line. Read Only ETA will depend on the guest's place  of incorporation, i.e. the system has to recognise the customer when it logs  in and display an appropriate Read Only ETA. Without accepting Read Only ETA  ""Guest"" user won't be able to view anything in the House.  Q:  1) Should Read Only ETA be printable and where?  2) What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User, i.e. one log in  session, limited time etc. - This decision has to be made in order for CC to  put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA. Read Only ETAs for all  jurisdictions have to be finalised by July 7th.  3) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform  potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be granted.  4) Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back  to Enron as a hard copy? The latest agreed was that it will be signed off  line, but accepting it online should work as well, and seems to be a cleaner  way...  3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get  Trading Access  There are two alternatives possible. Alternative One: Off Line Registration  Potential Customer will e-mail, phone to express their willingness to trade  online, i.e. get the ID and Password Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for  appropriate jurisdiction Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive IDs  and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual traders  in that company The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept  ETA.

2022-04-02 19:49:16+00:00,true,3,"  Let's be clear about all of the confusion which took place last week on how  to register,  this is what we are doing.  Any comments or problems please  reply.  I have tried to address everyone's points (see end of email).    1.  Current Customers  We are going to pre-register a large number of customers prior to the  launch.   These customers will not  receive any documentation from us apart  from the one page application form (Password Application) and a nice glossy  marketing brochure.  They will not be asked to fill in any form of registration documentation.   All of the approvals should be done internally as we already trade with these  people.  Procedure 1.  A list of customers to be pre-registered is compiled. 2.  Sign off on the list is obtained from Tax, Credit, Legal etc. 3. The customer receives from Enron a Password Application Form (postal) and  a marketing brochure (this will be very glossy with only high level details  nothing specific to the customer but will outline the registration process  (to include whether to send to UK os  US office).  The PA will be specific to  each country and therefore we should be able to send out the specific PA to  each counterparty. 4. The customer signs the document (Password Application) and returns to  Enron.  5. Enron dispatches the System Administrator password and login. 6.  The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as  loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the  country of origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the  customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice  of either ""I accept"" or ""I do not accept"" (with no default on enter).  This  ETA must be printable. 7.   The customer then enters the site and transacts.  If the customer is  transacting under a master then the GTC for a particular product will not  need to be accepted, if the customer is dealing without a master then any  person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords  can accept the GTC (it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under  this SA password).  The system will need to be loaded with the information as  to whether a counterparty requires GTC or not for each commodity/product type.  Elena's questions Q:  Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the  ""House""?  No only in the garden.  PA and ETA for all jurisdictions will be  available and printable in the garden (drop down box would be my suggestion).  2.  New Customers  There are two alternative routes possible.  Procedure 1: Off Line Registration  Potential Customer will e-mail, phone to express their willingness to trade  online, i.e. get the ID and Password Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for  appropriate jurisdiction. Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive the  system administrator login and password. The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded  for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of  origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the customer will  scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either ""I  accept"" or ""I do not accept"" (with no default on enter).  This ETA must be  printable. The customer then enters the site and transacts.The customer is transacting  GTCs for all  products and   any person using the administrator password or  any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be  accepted once by any one person under this SA password).     Procedure Two:  Partial OnLine Registration Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in  the Garden Customer has to chose (drop down box) which jurisdiction he is in,  print out  appropriate Registration Form and PA,  fill in Registration Form, sign PA and  mail it to Enron Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive the  system administrator login and password. The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded  for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of  origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the customer will  scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either ""I  accept"" or ""I do not accept"" (with no default on enter).  This ETA must be  printable. The customer then enters the site and transacts.The customer is transacting  GTCs for all  products and   any person using the administrator password or  any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be  accepted once by any one person under this SA password).    The Registration Form is currently in draft form and I attach below but  clearly Janine may want to add more on her side.  Elena's questions Q:  1) Alternative 1 or 2? Both  2) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform  potential customers that there request for access may not be granted.  YES -  In the  garden there must be a phrase that any access may not be granted and  that it is solely on our discretion (this is not just for Read Only its for  all applications)  3) Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden? CC  prefers them to be available...YES  3.  Read Only Customers  If a customer / counterparty does not respond by signing our PA and therefore  has not access to the site and we are very keen for them to be a trading  counterparty over the Internet we want a way of showing them what they are  missing.  So we will be sending them a password and login for read only  access.  We could also send out to bodies like regulators or brokers etc but  that will be up to the traders - any counterparties wanting access like this  would apply through th eroute outlined above for new counterparties and we  would authorise readonly access.  We will no be advertising read only access  as available.  They will be able to enter the site for a period for time (Enron needs to be  capable of setting system limits to the amount of time a  customer/counterparty is given read-only access for) unable to transact but  view only.    Procedure 1.  Either, Enron monitors the list of counterparties having registered  against the full counterparty list and notes that specific counterparty has  not registered.  The trading desk with primary trading contact with such  counterparty is contacted and asked if they would like to offer read only  access for a period of time. or,   a trader applies to the Online Product Control group for read only  access for one of his customers. 2.  The Product Control Group will issue a password/login which will be time  dated (only valid for a certain period). 3. The counterparty will login and immediately greeted by a Read Only ETA  -  these are to be country specific.   4. The counterparty must accept the Read Only ETA online before entering the  site where he has been given READ ONLY access.   5.   Under this scenario there is only one password and no capability of  creating any further passwords (not like a system administrator password). 6. When the password expires they will need a prompt box indicating how they  should register to continue seeing prices.  Elena's issues 1) Should Read Only ETA be printable and where? YES - should be printable  when it appears on screen at login (no need for it to be in the garden) 2) What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User, i.e. one log in  session, limited time etc. - This decision has to be made in order for CC to  put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA. Read Only ETAs for all  jurisdictions have to be finalised by July 7th. Needs to be flexible although  one password has no capability of creating further passwords, but the period  of time they are allowed access will depend on each trader.  Some customers  may be allowed in for one day others for one month. 3) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform  potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be  granted. We will not be advertising this facility and it will therefore not  be mentioned in the garden.  The only phrase in the garden refers to  customers who apply for a password may not get access (see above). 4) Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back to  Enron as a hard copy? The latest agreed was that it will be signed off line,  but accepting it online should work as well, and seems to be a cleaner  way...No this will be signed/clicked online just like the ETAs.  Mark's comments System administrator will not be a trader as far as the system is concerned.  If they are in reality that is none of our concern.  Agreed - we need to  change the name of System Administrator to Trader Administrator ETA acceptance process - we have legal confirmation of your comment? I would  expect that all users that trade on the system should read and accept it  (which I think is where Bob is coming from). Only one person per System  Administration Password / Trader Adminstrator password accepts the ETA.  Guest only users This concept was raised to us for the first time yesterday - and I have some  process queries on it. See above. How do we separate/ identify the applications? See above. What will be the process for upgrading users f they successfully apply for  full rights?  They need to receive a notice when their password expires which  prompts them to follow the application process.  2 other queries  - Why do they need an ETA when they will not be allowed to trade  electronically? Need a Read Only ETA - see document for further understanding Limitations to be imposed - where is this being coded and who by? There will  be a timetable impact. This is not new and therefore isn't  Bob's comments  1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000) The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept  ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all  other users. The first person logging on will always be the Administrator (to set up his  users) so how can a probable non-trading user accept ETAs for his traders?   Probably will be a trader - change the password to TRADER ADMINISTRATOR  PASSWORD/ MASTER TRADING PASSWORD  3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get  Trading Access Alternative 1 most closely mirrors what we're doing for our existing customer  base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control /  System Admin to run this. If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we  cut down on extra effort in a number of areas (marketing pack will be signed  off by legal, business processes already there, no extra development effort,  single point of reference). The marketing pack is a glossy brochure advertising our site within it there  will be the registration form, I think we do both alternatives.  Tim's comments   The process you have described is as I understood things, except that for Guest Users ( also referred to as Read Only Users - Regulators, Lawyers, Brokers, Potential Traders etc).  As we discussed on Wednesday and as Andrew mentioned yesterday, I understood the process to be as follows:   The Guest will phone or sent e-mail (possibly fill in a form online, that will be automatically e-mailed) to Enron System Administrator. Customers will provide info on their name, e-mail address, mailing address, country of incorporation  etc.   If Enron approves the customer as a Guest user, the System Administrator will  e-mail/fax to the Guest the Read Only ETA.  The Guest will execute the Read only ETA in hard copy and return it to Enron (by fax or post).  Enron will then issue a Guest ID and Password.  The Read Only ETA will be available on the website as a reminder to the Guest. This will not be in hard copy it will be online, see above we are not going  to advertise this read only capability.  OK?    Louise","Let's be clear about all of the confusion which took place last week on how to register, this is what we are doing. Any comments or problems please reply. 1. Current Customers.

Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)  The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept  ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all  other users. The first person logging on will always be the Administrator (to set up his  users) so how can a probable non-trading user accept ETAs for his traders? PA = Password Application, right? Hadn't heard of this until now.   3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get  Trading Access Alternative 1 most closely mirrors what we're doing for our existing customer  base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control /  System Admin to run this. If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we  cut down on extra effort in a number of areas (marketing pack will be signed  off by legal, business processes already there, no extra development effort,  single point of reference).   Any chance of seeing what format the marketing pack / application is in so  far? We'll need to make sure that the information we're requesting is  comprehensive enough from a systems' perspective.

Andrew.Wilkinson@cliffordchance.com cc:   Subject: Registration Process Questions  Last two days showed that there is a big confusion on how exactly the  registration process is going to work. The issue is very important and urgent  as it may cause changes to the scope for Agency.com, and changes in the ETA  and PA documents text.   The registration process appears to differ for different customer groups and,  to my understanding, the latest was agreed as below. Please provide your  comments or any corrections to the following:  1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)  will receive marketing Pack via mail approx. 2 weeks before the system goes  live. The Marketing Pack will include PA (for an appropriate jurisdiction)  and Registration Forms with questions about the customer (name, address,  e-mail, taxable entity etc.)  customers will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron After the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive  IDs and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual  traders in that company The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept  ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all  other users.  Q:  Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the  ""House""?   2. Guest Users ( also referred to as Read Only Users) - Regulators, Lawyers,  Brokers, Potential Traders etc.  will phone or sent e-mail (possibly fill in a form online, that will be  automatically e-mailed) to Enron System Administrator. Customers will provide  info on their name, e-mail address, mailing address, country of incorporation  etc. If Enron approves the customer as a Guest user, the System Administrator will  e-mail customer Guest ID and Password. When the customer logs in for the  first time as a guest, it'll  have to  accept Read Only ETA on line. Read Only ETA will depend on the guest's place  of incorporation, i.e. the system has to recognise the customer when it logs  in and display an appropriate Read Only ETA. Without accepting Read Only ETA  ""Guest"" user won't be able to view anything in the House.  Q:  1) Should Read Only ETA be printable and where?  2) What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User, i.e. one log in  session, limited time etc. - This decision has to be made in order for CC to  put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA. Read Only ETAs for all  jurisdictions have to be finalised by July 7th.  3) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform  potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be granted.  4) Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back  to Enron as a hard copy? The latest agreed was that it will be signed off  line, but accepting it online should work as well, and seems to be a cleaner  way...  3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get  Trading Access  There are two alternatives possible. Alternative One: Off Line Registration  Potential Customer will e-mail, phone to express their willingness to trade  online, i.e. get the ID and Password Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for  appropriate jurisdiction Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive IDs  and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual traders  in that company The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept  ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all  other users.  Alternative Two:  Partial OnLine Registration  Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in  the Garden Customer has to chose (drop down box) which jurisdiction he is in,  print out  appropriate Registration Pack and PA,  fill in Registration Form, sign PA and  mail it to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive IDs  and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual traders  in that company The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept  ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all  other users.  Q:  1) Alternative 1 or 2?  2) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform  potential customers that there request for Read Only access may not be  granted.  3) Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden? CC  prefers them to be available...

2022-04-02 11:35:37+00:00,true,4,"  June 23, 1999  Home, A sort of honor, not a building site, Wherever we are, when, if we chose, we might, Be somewhere else, but trust that we have chosen right.  W.H. Auden  The view from my living room, a southern view, begins with a mess of red tiled rooftops tumbling down to the Halic (Golden Horn).  On the other side of the Halic (a river-harbor, once beautiful and fast flowing, now stalled and polluted) are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium (later to be called Constantinople, later still Istanbul) was founded nearly six centuries before the birth of Christ.  Above a cement colored smear of apartment buildings of much more recent vintage, I can make out the outlines of towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the 500's AD. I can also see the massive Selimiye and Mihrimah Mosques, built in the 1500's during the reign of perhaps the greatest Ottoman, Suleyman the Magnificent.  Otherwise, the hillsides of Eski (Old) Istanbul are covered by the before mentioned apartment buildings, relatively new but already appearing weary from overuse and ready for replacement.  They are, I suppose, full of people who for the most part work far too much for far too little and who must wonder, more and more, with each passing day, about the relevance of their muezzins' cries.  Incongruously, hundreds, maybe thousands, of sea gulls, screeching a bit like Halloween pranksters, dip and rise in the air space between me and all of that.  I recently bought a cheap guitar (I left a better one back in the States) from my friend Ilyas, and from time to time I sit looking out my window while playing sad songs from America's south (the easiest kind to play -- slow, with three chords and, as Bono [pretentiously] said, the truth).  This evening, I did just that, singing and playing, among others, a song by Steve Earle, in which he laments having forgotten to say goodbye to some long ago love (""Was I off somewhere, or maybe just too high?"") and one by Lucinda Williams, who sings about hitting the road in order to forget (""When I get to Baton Rouge, I won't cry a tear for you"").  A pile of clouds staacked up on the horizon prevents me from seeing the sunset, but the invisible sun still makes its presence know, bordering them crimson.  I watch the neddle-like vapor trail of a jet crawl west -- until it too disappears behind the clouds -- all the time wondering about when I too will be heading in that same direction.  What will it be like to be in America again?  I don't think I've ever developed particularly deep psychic connections with places, though that is not to say I haven't loved the places I've lived.  I truly adore San Francisco and I always come to Dallas's defense.  I appreciate Aurora (Illinois) and miss Westfield (New Jersey), often wondering what it would have been like to have finished my growing up there.  But because, perhaps, I ultimately value experience more than comfort -- and, don't get me wrong, I value comfort a great deal -- maybe I haven't been able to convince myself, at some critical, fundamental level, to believe that settling down in one place (or, come to think of it, with one person) for the rest of my life is an  ultimate goal.  Of course, I worry about where this all might lead, with the specter of absolute -- and perhaps, God forbid, unbearable -- loneliness sometimes seeming a real possibility.  But, then again, maybe I'm just looking for the ultimate home, and will burrow in deeply once I've found it.  My great buddy Misha and his wife Nina just returned to their home after what was, for me at least, a wonderful ten-day visit.  They weren't so sure about the Boza (a sweet, slightly fermented drink made from millet) I accosted them with at a tiny caf? in the center of Eski Istanbul, but they tried it anyway.  Later, forgetting about how scared I had been the first time I was there, I think I spooked them a bit when I lead them on a post-dusk walk through the ""working class"" Kucuk Pazar neighborhood (on our way to the breathtaking interior and exterior views at the Suleymaniye Mosque).  While passing through Kucuk Pazar, we turned into one particularly poorly lit street and came upon a crowd of men talking and smoking in near total darkness.  (I could only tell they were smoking by the occasional flare of the embers at the end of their cigarettes.)  After first not knowing what in the world we'd stumbled onto, I realized we were passing near a hamam (Turkish public bath) -- no doubt an immensely important institution in Kucuk Pazar, as many of the apartments there (I have been told) have no showers.  Notwithstanding these, and a few other nonstarters, I still think Misha and Nina's trip was a success.  We did and saw a lot, albiet while suffering through the hot, humid beginnings of an Istanbul summer.  Probably of most significance, to me, was checking in with Misha after nearly nine months apart.  We had much to talk about, or at least to allude to vaguely.  During one of our more memorable (i.e. ridiculous) jaunts into these wordy never-never lands (which occurred on the roof porch of my building and lasted until four in the morning), Misha was patient and courteous when I suggested that maybe our lives are played out in the barely understood space between an incomprehensible universe and an equally incomprehensible self. Misha wanted to give ourselves more credit in the ability to understand department.  In response, I referred to some of the books I've read.  This summer I will not be taking formal Turkish lessons, though I plan on studying Turkish a lot; for example, translating newspaper articles and writing and, with the help of Ismail and Sukran, trying to absorb more deeply all that I have learned to date.  And I have learned a lot, including an incredible amount of grammar and vocabulary.  Still, I wonder if this old dog brain of mine is thinking less about the next meal than about where to lay down afterwards.  My biggest problem -- among many, I know -- is ""hearing"" Turkish.  (My two most used sentences are ""Ne dediniz [What did you say]?"" and ""Tekrar soyleyebilir misiniz [Can you say that again]?"".)  I will be buying a television (ugh!), as I've concluded that a television is an important way to learn how to ""hear"" Turkish.  Most importantly, this summer I will finally be beginning a regular writing program, writing for a least three hours a day, five days a week. (""Insallah [With god's help]."")  That, coupled with work and Turkish (and my reading), should keep me pretty busy and, hopefully, productive.  At least I should be sending a few more e-mails.  More later.

This month we are going to look briefly at the types of counterparty with  which we can trade derivatives in (or from) the UK under SFA (and CFTC)  rules, and at the principle of selling to them only products which are  ""suitable"".  Eligible Counterparties  All derivatives trading in the UK (as you know) must be conducted through  Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited, (""EEFT""), which always acts as  agent.  EEFT may arrange derivatives transactions only with ""eligible""  counterparties.                      In general, an ""eligible counterparty"" is either:  (i) an investment bank that is regulated by SFA (such as Bankers Trust or  Morgan Stanley) or an overseas dealer in commodity derivatives  authorised by  its local regulator; or  (ii) a company that has (or whose holding company has) total assets in excess  of $10,000,000 (approximately o6,500,000); and either   (a) 20 or more shareholders and a paid up share capital or net assets of at  least o500,000; or   (b) fewer than 20 shareholders and a paid up share capital or net assets of  at least o5,000,000.  Other types of entity may qualify as an ""eligible"" counterparty, but please  consult with the Legal Department in these cases.  Suitability Requirements  In addition to the above, each EEFT Registered Representative should  understand and apply the customer suitability principles that have been  adopted by ECT. These principles require that Registered Representatives only  offer products which are suitable for each counterparty, taking into account  its level of expertise and the use which the product serve.  This means that  in the case of less sophisticated counterparties or more complex/exotic  products (or both) extra caution needs to be exercised.  It is also essential  in all cases that no misleading statements are made (orally or in  writing).                                        Best regards                                                                             Paul                                                                            ",This is excellent -- please put a copy in our SFA compliance file.

2022-04-02 21:04:42+00:00,true,5,"  This Risk Memo relates to our first import of physical power into Italy.  Under the deal, we supply the municipality, IMOLA, with 66GWh of power at the  Swiss/Italian border for 1 year (rolling for further yearly periods if the  contract is not terminated by either party). The contract value is in the  region of o1 million. The power is for onward supply to IMOLA's own customers.  The contract is on a standard form I produced recently in conjunction with  Italian counsel, but warrants this risk memo as it is the first deal of its  kind.  It is conditional on IMOLA securing from the Italian network operator  (ENEL) transmission from the border to the ultimate customer within 90 days.  We have agreed we will extend this period by a further 90 days in appropriate  circumstances. We prepared the customer's request for transmission to give it  the best possible chance of success.  As required by Italian law, IMOLA have the right to terminate the contract at  any time (including during the first year) upon 6 months' notice. We are  raising with the Italian Energy Authority whether such a right of termination  (which was recently introduced under the new energy law) is appropriate for  one year deals such as this. In the case of IMOLA, we are seeking to restrict  their right of termination to cases where their own customers have exercised  the same right (this will stop IMOLA shopping around for a better price). It  is not clear whether this restriction is effective under the new law, but we  have principle on our side (the law is intended to protect the ultimate  customer) and there is no legal (or other) down-side in including it.  Each party has a right of termination if interconnector charges above a  certain proportion of the contract price are introduced. However, it is worth  noting that there are no such charges levied at the moment and (so far as we  are aware) none are proposed.  The contract includes a right on the part of Enron to match third party  offers IMOLA may receive when the contract expires, and Italian counsel have  confirmed that this right should be legally enforceable by us.   The deal (and indeed the standard form) is subject to Italian law and to ICC  arbitration in Geneva.  There are no particular legal risks under this transaction, but please call  me if you would like to discuss it in greater detail.  Best regards  Paul","This risk memo relates to our first import of physical power into Italy.

2022-04-02 15:26:51+00:00,true,6,"  Attorney Client Privilege--Not Discoverable  Here is a final thought about this PX situation before I take off.  In the  normal give and take of haggling that has been going on since time out of  mind in trading transactions, there is an element of deception.  The seller  always bluffs that his product is much more valuable than it actually may be,  in fact, the less valuable the product, the more the bluffing.  The buyer  always treats the seller's product with disdain.  It is fundamentally  necessary for an efficient market to work for buyers and sellers to be able  to string each other along  with various  posturing gambits.  Price is the  result of two hagglers finally coming forward out of the smoke surrounding  their ritual dance  and shaking hands on a number.  By experimenting with the  nuances of the PX software system  are traders not  merely doing what they  have been doing since Biblical times,   i.e.  interjecting the absolutely  essential ingredient of deceptive posturing  into the relatively new form of   electronic commerce?   What is the difference between  (a) one of our traders getting on the phone  when we are short of power and bargaining for a good price  with a supply  source  as though we have plenty of power and might just be willing to help  the supplier out if he gives us a good deal,  and  (b) scheduling 3000 mw at  Silver Peak when there is  15 mw of physical  capacity?  If the technology of  electronic commerce cannot absorb the artful rituals of  real haggling, maybe  it should be seen as a temporary experiment and rejected in favor of the time  honored traditions.  In any event, participants should not be expected to be  punished for experimenting.   --cgy  ","Attorney Client Privilege--Not Discoverable Here is a final thought about this PX situation before I take off.
