If we would have had any idea  that Europe could have been as big as it has become, we would have done some  things differently and we can get a head start with Japan.  Thursday sounds  great and just let me know about Friday.  Is Anthony in japan during the  trip?  Remember,  I am not a technologist and therefore can't discuss  technology specific applications just the business concepts and potential  ideas and opportunities.  A couple of other questions about the trip.  Do you want me to make any  presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans?  Also, what is  the appropriate dress code.  I am assuming suits but i didn't want to make  any assumptions about new cultures.  Do you have any cultural facts that you  can fax me about the do's and don'ts of both cultures?  Do I have clear  instruction how to take the train from the airport.  I normally get a driver,  I am uncomfortable in new countries that I can't speak any of the language.   If there is a way to get lost, I'll find a way.  One more item, could you please have your assistant set up a message for me  at the hotel.  I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it  really helps.  Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel  after the trip.  I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the  Japanese culture.

Thursday's schedule is fairly set, and we are working  on Friday.  Thursday morning through to the afternoon we would present to you  the current state of the business and the initiatives/proposition/etc for  enron.co.jp.  This would take us through mid afternoon.  We would then go  over to EPower and we would ask you to give a talk on the state of technology  at Enron and the initiatives within Net Works.  We would bring EJ over to  EPower for your talk.  Afterwards we would have drinks with the main  commercial team at EPower and EJ.  Dinner to be arranged for a smaller  group.  On Friday, we would like to use the time to set up some meetings with  key IT/tech companies here in Japan.  To date, we have not yet met any of  these companies, but there is currently an extraordinary amount of activity  in the country.  We are looking to leverage some of Enron's banking  relationships to get as high a level meeting as possible with the likes of  Softbank.  We are also asking for other suggestions from the banks.  We are  also considering a potential talk with the American Chamber of Commerce on  Enron and Enron Technology.  The ACCJ is one of the most active and largest  chambers in the world and bring in some quite interesting speakers.  We will  have more on this.

2022-04-11 11:20:28+00:00,false,2,"  Congratulations to you on a job well done!  Yesterday's meeting with Joe  Sutton demonstrated all of your hard work.    As you saw yesterday, there's a very high probability that this program will  become reality.  This means we need to consider what our next design,  development and implementation steps are.     Press Release Another important consideration includes a possible near-term press release  (three weeks or less possibly).   Those who have already press released this  (Ford, Delta, American and Intel) have included the following in their press  release : company purpose and benefits, hardware vendor/specs, web portal  elements, planned deployment period, elig. employees, co-pay if any, and  other business partners involved in this transaction.  For those of you who  are working with vendors, please pursue final steps up to the point of  contract execution.  For the portal development and IT infrastructure, please  proceed with next steps inthose areas as well.  I will work on employees  elig., updating the npv model, and drafting a press release with your input.   Co-Pay Tax and Legal have begun discussions about how a partial company subsidy or  employee co-pay impacts this program.  If you have a position on this matter,  please let Tony, Sharon or myself know.  Cynthia, what additional admin costs  are involved with a co-pay? Can you provide input?  BU Input  Cindy asked that Todd N, Allen H and myself meet with EBS upper management to  discuss this program for input.  I will call when we get on Kevin's calendar.   PGE  Tony, if we do not offer this to PGE employees, does it preclude us from  taking the positive employee tax treatment proposed in the pending  legislation?  Thanks again for all of your hard work.  I have asked Stacey Dempsey to coordinate a meeting to regroup the team to  discuss the details that I have mentioned above and any other detail  necessary.

Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May, they were making up for  reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they  are entitled but not obliged to do.  Since return from outage at the end of  May they have declined to nominate at the NBP.    From 1 January to 15 May, the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept  underdeliveries to 350 mmcf (ie one day's maximum quantity) in total.  Since  returning from the maintenance shutdown, underdeliveries have totalled 850  mmcf ( averaging 77mcf/d ).  We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the  maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than  make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the  penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of  the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily  price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm.  Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to  deliver additional volumes at  another alternative to avoid default but they  have not responded yet.  You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to  getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.  This has cost  us about $1.5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their  non performance.    Perhaps a phone call by you might help.

He is obviously wanting to  resurface Infrastructure World.  As you will note in the last paragraph, he  is basically staking out a position that EECC is going to have to spend $2  million on project management software development and  that he can capture  free optionality of doing a deal with infrastructure world.  On the surface of it, this does not make sense on several dimensions:  1. It is not clear to me why EECC has to spend $2 million on project  management software development. By definition, such software would want to  be collaborative  and I don't understand the logic of why we would do it  ourselves.  2. If there is a seperate carve-out of project management software that is  required for what we do that is separate from what existing functionality of  Cepren, Buzzsaw and Bidcom is doing; we may have an opportunity to do joint  development with any of these players. The question is picking who we think  would be a winner and figuring out if there is a deal to be done. Allan and  Drew, together with the EECC, have orchestrated meetings next week with these  three companies to figure out ways that EECC may be able to work together  with one of them. I would note that Bechtel is an investor in Cephren so it  is not clear that they expected these to entities to be directly competitive.  It is not clear that Infrastructure World is preferable to one of these other  alternatives.  3. It is obviously not my call as to whether EECC needs or will spend $2  million for Project Management software development (although I am  skeptical). From an investment perspective, there has not been that much that  has progressed on Infrastructure World in the last six to eight weeks. The  principal change has been a significant revaluation  and critical assessment  of B2B business plans and particularly revenue models. I would thus say that  two months ago my assessment given the Bechtel/Hull involvement that there  was a 75% ability to do legitimate VC at $5 to $10 million pre-money (as  opposed to the $15 million that it was done at). I would say that the  probability would be 25% of $5 to $10 million with significant risk of doing  subsequent rounds. I would thus have a view that we should pass from an  investment perspective.  I have left Larry a voice mail that I am available to meet when I am back  Thursday and Friday when I am back from my father's funeral. I will have a  discussion along these points. I am on vacation next week , but  told Larry  in the voice mail that the alternative is to meet with Allan (who is out this  week) and one of the people from my team.

Vince asked me to ask you to put a set of interviews together (as I  understand, Vince himself will be unavailable that day).    Mark Tawney should see him; someone from weather marketing and/or  structuring should see him, e.g. Gary Taylor and/or Michael Nguyen; some more  people from research should grill him on technical and meteorology issues,  e.g. Vasant and/or Zimin as well as Mike Roberts or someone on his team. Phil  has only been a ""quant"" since the departure of Koch's previous weather quant  in February; before that he was Koch's weather ""risk manager"". I am still not  sure what the distinction means, but we do need to find out how much he knows  about option pricing and meteorology. Even though his expressed desire is to  focus on weather derivatives, we should also assess how useful he would be  from research group's perspective, since research will likely be his official  home.   Finally, Jere Overdyke and/or someone else from his group (George Carrick,  if available) should also get a chance to meet with him. I've already spoken  with Phil, but I'd like to sit in with either Vasant or Zimin or Mike when  they interview him, since I wasn't able to ask any technical questions.   If I'm counting correctly, that should amount to five interview sessions,  perhaps less if we interview in groups of two. Phil's resume is enclosed  below.  Joe  P.S.

2022-04-11 09:28:17+00:00,false,5,"  John, The Policy was re-written in haste in the fall of 1998 (by some chump named  seyfried) to attempt to incorporate a new paradigm in the way we managed our  Merchant Portfolio.  The new paradigm never materialized for a number of  reasons, leaving the Policy somewhat ambiguous.  We had been hesitant to  change it given that we were never quite sure whether or not this thought  process would be resurrected.  It appears that now would be a good time to  consider changes to reflect current business practices and add clarity.  I  will take a shot at it myself for the August Board meeting, however, I would  prefer to do so with your and Lavo's input.  Please advise at your earliest  convenience.  On some specifics: Officially, the EIP portfolio has never been used.  It was a holdover from  the SPP (supply positioning pool) associated with the Sithe transaction.   There have been those that have referenced EIP/SPP in the past, however, I  believe that this was done so in error and not in compliance with Policy. The Capital portfolio was originally intended to provide capital market  hedges for the Merchant Portfolio and trade the stock of Enron Corp and other  Enron Corp public entitiies (EOG) on an opportunistic basis.  The capital  market transfer process has yet to take place (nor does it look like it is  ever going to), therefore this portfolio has been used solely for the  CFO/Treasurer to take mark-to-market postions in Enron.   I will adjust the authorized trader list to reflect the oversight  responsibility and the change of LNG to John.   Thanks for your input.

A separate message about  this visit will follow.  I would like also to talk to you  about the way we manage our relationships  with different universities. Historically, we were rather passive customers of the academic institutions, trying to hire the best students and limiting our  presence on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions.  We should rethink the way we work  with universities. The efforts to get  the best students look more and more like a hand-to-hand combat and often we  are not very successful. It is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways:  1. Involvement in research projects. For  example, we are currently   underwriting two research projects at Stanford University, involving  Ph.D. students of Professor   Nicholas Bambos (a top expert on communications networks). We shall participate in formulation of the projects' objectives and will be given access to the results. Involvement in research projects allows us to obtain  access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and  also to lock-up some very promising students. Most companies in the high tech industries have such  programs.  2. Lectures and presentations by Enron employees. Practically every  presentation I have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes  and hiring decisions. It is important that students get exposed to Enron early in their academic  program. In many cases, the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach  them during their  senior years.  3. Visits by faculty members in Enron.   Closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to  getting the best students and obtaining access to current research. The universities are very important  in shaping public  opinion on the issues critical to Enron's future (especially in the area of  deregulation and design of new markets).  Currently, the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on  personal commitment of a number of overworked Enron employees. In many cases, there is no continuity and  focus.  I want to recommend a creation of a special function (VP or MD level)  responsible for coordinating our relationships with the universities. This function would be separate from  our Analyst/Associate program. I have many ideas how this function could be structured.

It has been four years since the first edition was published. During this hiatus, a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline. The second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics.  The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity. As expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges, which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope. It includes a lengthy introduction that effectively frames risk management progress, advancements and innovations that started in the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to the natural gas and most recently expanding to the electricity industry.  Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15 chapters, all of which include an introduction, which minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from a book written by a large number of authors. Other improvements in this second edition include expanded graphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and a separate glossary, which provides the reader with additional reference material.  In particular the chapter on energy options written by Michael Hampton is a useful primer and provides the reader with a concise explanation of option theory, pricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practical guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure speculation. For the more advanced reader, the chapter on Energy Exotic Options, written by Vince Kaminski, Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni is particularly strong as it outlines the challenges associated with the exotics and effectively documents the latest methods used by leading practitioners in pricing such instruments.  Additionally, the chapter on Accounting for Derivative Contracts in the Energy Environment by three consultants from Arthur Anderson, is a well written summary which addresses the numerous tax related issues including a timely discussion on the US Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement 133 (see EPRM October 1999, page 22). Having this tax information housed in one concise chapter is of great value.  The second edition however is not without flaws. In particular, it would have been useful to have more information on the current challenges risk managers are confronted with in the power industry including latest advancements in volatility and correlation estimation techniques. Additional attention could have also been placed on the shortcomings of the current market structure and methods in finding and applying appropriate hedging strategies and instruments. In the fledgling power market, this continues to be one of the primary challenges.  In summary, this second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the new recruit or seasoned veteran. It is a welcome edition to any risk management library.       ","Krishna, I shall order reprints. Vince Shirley, Can you, please, order reprints?

I got almost same results as the  ones produced by the current production VaR model.  I did found two things:  1.  The positions in Storage-Prc changed although the total position did not  change much:  For July delivery:  delta changed from 2,682,338 to 5,695,589  For Sep. delivery: delta changed from 4,629,638 to 1,682,515.  2.  The forward forward NG volatility has a big change on Dec-01:  May 31 :   0.0122956  May 30 : 0.278       But the Original Vol curve don't change much.   I also changed code so that it will read NG forward forward vol curve from a  file.  We can run some testing today.  Look  like Jin found some problem in the factor loading  program.  If we can  produce new factor loadings we can also rerun VaR using the new factor  loadings.  If there is anything else we can do, please let me know.  Thanks!

2022-04-11 22:24:55+00:00,false,5,"  This memo follows up on our discussion this morning.  With respect to the 15 million of increased VAR that the Board allocated to  Rick Buy and Jeff Skilling I propose the following:  1.  5 Million be allocated to EES and therefore remove EES's positions from  the Wholesale gas and power groups (This has already been done).  2.  Move the control and decision making of 5 Million of VAR each to the  trading heads of North America (Lavorato) and Europe (Sherriff).  3.  With respect to North America I intend to create a group called the  ""Cross Commodity Trading Group"" which will warehouse the 5 Million of VAR and  use it as it sees fit (I will run this group and currently be the only  employee).  This will start out as an administrative structure to use if we  need to throw more VAR at certain positions (I see the individual trading  groups staying within their VAR limits).  However, I do see the need for a  true cross commodity group that would search for low risk / high probability  trades accross the commodities that we trade.  This structure may help to  start us down this path.  Please let me know what you think.  John",This memo follows up on our discussion this morning.

2022-04-11 09:38:56+00:00,false,5,"  I thought the EIP was the stock option hedging.  Who is doing that and how  are we tracking it so it doesn't get screwed up like it did earlier in the year.  John   To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT cc: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron   Subject: Re: Authorized Traders    John, The Policy was re-written in haste in the fall of 1998 (by some chump named  seyfried) to attempt to incorporate a new paradigm in the way we managed our  Merchant Portfolio.  The new paradigm never materialized for a number of  reasons, leaving the Policy somewhat ambiguous.  We had been hesitant to  change it given that we were never quite sure whether or not this thought  process would be resurrected.  It appears that now would be a good time to  consider changes to reflect current business practices and add clarity.  I  will take a shot at it myself for the August Board meeting, however, I would  prefer to do so with your and Lavo's input.  Please advise at your earliest  convenience.  On some specifics: Officially, the EIP portfolio has never been used.  It was a holdover from  the SPP (supply positioning pool) associated with the Sithe transaction.   There have been those that have referenced EIP/SPP in the past, however, I  believe that this was done so in error and not in compliance with Policy. The Capital portfolio was originally intended to provide capital market  hedges for the Merchant Portfolio and trade the stock of Enron Corp and other  Enron Corp public entitiies (EOG) on an opportunistic basis.  The capital  market transfer process has yet to take place (nor does it look like it is  ever going to), therefore this portfolio has been used solely for the  CFO/Treasurer to take mark-to-market postions in Enron.   I will adjust the authorized trader list to reflect the oversight  responsibility and the change of LNG to John.   Thanks for your input. Ted    John Sherriff 06/05/2000 09:37 AM To: Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron  Subject: Re: Authorized Traders     A couple of points and questions:  1)   Is the EIP position going to get traced on the DPR - because this has  gotten fouled up in the past 2)   Can we be more explicit on what constitutes the Capital Portfolio - I  think there has been        confusion on what is here as well. 3)  Also why not show if Lavo or I have the overview role.  For example now  that LNG has moved under Shankman       Lavo should take the oversight role rather than me.

2022-04-11 19:55:52+00:00,false,5,"  Good Morning Mr. Lavorato,  I am e-mailing you to give you an update on the appraisal process. Both appraisers went in to see the property on Friday June 16, 2000.  We are  expecting one written report today and the other one tomorrow.  We should be  in a position to give you your guarantee price by the middle of next week.  I was advise by Cendant Mobility that your spouse's first name is Dina.   Please advise me if this is not the correct spelling of her name.  I will  correct it in our system.   You can contact me by return e-mail at  Pfournie@Royallepage2.com or by phone at 416-386-6028 or 1-800-410-2983 ext.  6028 Since I'm not totally sure at this point if your family has already vacated  the property in Calgary so I don't want to send any documents there.   I am  attaching three documents to this e-mail so that you have them with you .  The first document is the offer information form and disclosure statement.   Since this document forms part of the guaranteed offer,  and would ask you to  please complete this document and return it to me by fax by Monday June  26th.  My fax# is 416-448-6358.  The second document is a blank guarantee offer.   This document will be used  in the event that you are able to negotiate a verbal agreement with a buyer  prior to a guarantee price being established. If this situation occurs, please insert the agreed upon price and sign the  RLRS Offer,.  Return it by fax , along with the Power of Attorney which forms  part of this package. Once these documents are received by RLRS, we are in a legal position to sign  an offer on your home showing RLRS as the vendor.  The last document is the amended sale program  procedures . This is the  relocation program that has been approved by your company for your  relocation. It outlines in detail the procedures to be followed under that  program. It is a program that has been designed by the I.R.S. and the U.S. relocation  council to deal with the issues of relocation and taxable benefits. One thing that I want to you to remember is that if you have an offer on your  property,  you must negotiate it verbally and please do not signed nor  initial anything on the offer.  Once you have come to a verbal agreement   with a purchaser, Royal Lepage will sign that offer on your behalf.  You can contact me at the office between 8:00 to 4:00 or leave a voice mail  message anytime.  I will be on vacation next week June 26th to June 30th. If you need  assistance during that week please contact Jessica Desouza at 416-510-5764 or  you can use the 800# and ask for ext. 5764.  Jessica will contact you next  week with your guarantee price.  Could you also please e-mail me your mailing address where to courier your  guaranteed offer.

2022-04-11 19:27:59+00:00,false,5,"  I hope that the following clears up some of the  confusion regarding the  above-captioned process.  Factor loadings are an input to Value-at-Risk (VAR).  Generally, you can  consider them the determinants of relationships between curves,and points on  curves based on trader inputs.   These pertain to all curves not just North  American Natural Gas.  There is a specific program which calculates these  relationships which requires a considerable amount of processing time (3  hours per run) as well as another few man-days to evaluate the results.    There is no ""ideal"" or recommended period in which these must be updated.   More frequent is ""better"".  Given the amount of time it takes to refresh, it  was ""agreed"" a long time ago amongst  RAC, Research, IT and Operations that  it would be done every 2 weeks.  No commercial input was received.  The roles  were to be simple as they are with most roles in and around VAR and other  risk management controls:    Research specifies the math  IT codes the program  Operations runs the program  RAC evaluates the results   The process has been run every two weeks on the second Thursday of every  month since February (as it had been prior) and RAC has rejected the results  because the results did not reflect the underlying math because of the  complexity of the math and the continuing addition of new products and  curves.  This  created the need to recode the application from scratch.   RAC  continued to agitate to get this done, particularly knowing that the pressure  on the efficacy of VAR would be questioned as we went into the volatile  period of 2000 ( e-mails from Rudi Zipter available upon request).  The new  code was implemented last Thursday and the results were accepted resulting in  an approximate 10% difference in VAR.  RAC had requested that the code be re-written on 6/10/99 @ 7:44 am with a  target completion date of  8/2/99.  This was discussed and accepted by  Phillipe Bibi on 6/17/99 in a meeting in his conference room with Rick Buy,  Dan Bruce, Jonathon Le, Ted Murphy, Bill Bradford, Debbie Brackett and Rudi  Zipter along with the rest of our task list.    We have resolved that the process will continue as stated and will  communicate to you the results.   There are dozens of other processes that are important to the calculation and  interpretation of VAR that need to be implemented, enhanced, improved or  rewritten altogether.  For example, the jump-diffusion factors for North  American Power have not been refreshed in 2000.  The prioirty is dependent on  the level of precision required.   I will provide a comprehensive list of those processes in due course.  Ted  ","I hope that the following clears up some of the confusion regarding the above-captioned process.

Vince     Benjamin Parsons 06/12/2000 05:50 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: INSEAD High-tech Acquisitions Workshop  Vince  I attended the Workshop on High-tech acquisitions at Insead on Saturday  alongside participants from Cisco, EADS, Razorfish and Cable+Wireless, and  academics from Insead and Wharton. The basic premise was to discuss and get  feedback from practitioners about the Research Project, and a PhD study which  is currently underway at Wharton. The discussions were very interesting -  especially as this was my first exposure to this area.   Examples of the discussions raised include why firms acquire new businesses instead of developing them in-house what degree of post-acquisition integration was optimal difficulties of US firms acquiring Euro/Asian high-tech companies how to value small high-tech firms how to quantify the success/failure of an acquisition  My feeling is that further work with them in this area would be beneficial to  Enron because it would help the development of the academic research and give  us first-hand access to the results. Plus it would enable us to learn from  the mistakes of others, through meeting practitioners at such workshops and  having greater access to the case studies. I guess it could also aid our  realignment within the high-tech/communication industry to be seen in such  studies.  Regards  Ben  ","Ben Thanks for attending.

2022-04-11 06:57:47+00:00,true,5,"  John,  We have  been working for the last few days on VaR related issues. The focus is on Jim Schwieger's  storage book as of 5/25 and 5/26 where we had some counterintuitive results. This book is a good candidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.  It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR  system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative  basis, jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position. This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a  big jump in VaR. This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, look at column D.  The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors:   a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the                      code to review it.   b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in                     the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can  propose, is to develop for                     the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to  review the fwd vol curve                     before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,   it can be smoothed.  Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings?   Vince","John, We have been working for the last few days on VaR related issues.

2022-04-11 14:26:44+00:00,true,5,"  Dear Dale, Stinson & Vince,  I would like to take this opportunity to communicate some information to  summarise the projects of the past six months.  Firstly, by all accounts it  has been an amazing few months for me - I believe that I have kept a large  number of commercial group heads very happy.  However, not all are aware of  my activities, so, many people (e.g. John Sherriff, Richard Lewis, Steve  Young etc.) will not know of everything I have done.  For example the amount  of work that I put into the inflation models and the extent to which I was  critical for the successful building of those curves and the consequent  impact (o7+ million for Q1) and similar large P&L swings for Eastern contract  optionality (short virtual power station) based upon my UK Power Vol Curve  Generator.  For your benefit, I have compiled a shortlist of the main projects worked on  over the past five/six months:  1) Inflation curve modelling (February and March + April internal audit +  June external audit) 2) UK Power Monthly Vol Curve generator & ideas for half-hourly vol curve 3) Nordic Power Monthly Vol Curve generator 4) Energydesk.com models & support 5) Real Options: options to build/extend power stations (e.g. Wessex deal,  Anti-Freeze project) 6) Continental power non-generic options (using arbitrary trader-specified  distributions) 7) Global products: non-generic options modelling and new commodity forward  curve construction (benzene fwd curve from naphtha) 8) Exotic options library upgrade/model test/bug fixes (e.g. testing new/old  Asian models) 9) Continental gas volatility curve construction 10) Communication objective I: two presentations to Enron Europe staff, one  to Oslo office 11) Communication objective II: meetings to gather information and present  results 12) FAS 133: working with internal and external auditors on matching  financial and physical (accrual) hedges - hedge effectiveness 13) Oslo trip: bringing Oslo up to speed on EXOTICA and option valuation 14) Houston Research staff: co-ordinating communication/meetings to maximise  productivity 15) Valuation/Marketing of Power put options for banks that hold senior and  sub debt in merchant power plant  Meeting breakdown:    Initiated by me & booked into meeting rooms  Attended (initiated by others)  Jan  4       5 Feb  6       5 Mar  23       8 Apr  25       4 May  34       5 Jun  12 (so far)       3  I believe I have kept as many commercial groups happy as is possible; it is  clear that I have been critical to large P&L sensitive projects and hope that  I can continue to help enhance earnings going forward.

As a result, the Cplex people feel that there is no  need to provide the user with the tools to represent special-ordered sets in  OPL. As a matter of fact, the incapability of Xpress to recognize them  automatically concerns me.  If you have special requirements, C code may be used to pass the information  to the solver (which is straight forward; all of Chonawee's testing was done  this way). Chonawee's benchmark shows a superior performance by Cplex (which  you indicated yourself in an earlier message). If you feel that Xpress is the only way to go, then feel free to purchase it  (the purchase order is on hold for the time being). However, we need to check  with Vince first.

2022-04-11 03:57:25+00:00,true,6,"  We are continuing to work with the Enron LNG team to set up risk books and  capture the trading postions and P/L of their business.  At the present time  we are focusing on the Elba Island transaction, however, the LNG team has  requested information concerning an accrual book to accurately capture the  risks associated with their LNG Vessel ""Mystic Lady"" as well as an additional  vessel they are looking to acquire.  Eric Groves has built a curve generating model that will facilitate the risk  books and/or any exotic option models that may be necessary.   As of Friday,  we have not received the information needed to capture all of the FOB and  Delivered Curves.  We have been in contact with Enron LNG and they will be  forwarding this information.  We are expecting to sit down with the LNG  commercial team late next week to obtain assumptions such as product sourcing  locations and the timing of anticipated spot cargoes for delivery to Elba  Island.  Once we receive the additional information for the curves and the sourcing  assumptions, we will be in a position to sit down with the research group and  determine the most appropriate means of valuing these transactions.  We are  also working with the Europe Engineering group as a source of validating some  of the information that we have received.    Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further.

I received my M.S. in Finance in May of last year, and chose  to?remain at  LSU to work on my Ph.D. At that time, I intended to pursue a  career  in?teaching and research at a four year college or university.?  In  part?because of your visit,?and my?primary interest in  normative research,  my?plans have changed.? While I?still want to  earn my Ph.D.,?I plan to  pursue a career in research in the private  sector. ? As you know, Ph.D. programs in financial economics are  designed to train  future academics.? Not surprisingly, they emphasize  methods to approach the  types of questions that are of interest to finance  academics.? What did  surprise me, however, was that these areas of interest  often had little to  do with what I imagined to be the concerns of practitioners  in the real  world.? As you mentioned in your discussion, academic  researchers know  little about what their counterparts in the private sector   are?doing.?????????????????????????????????????   ? In light of my objective, I feel I would get the most out of  the remainder  of my doctoral studies if I took some time off to work in the  private sector  to see first hand the?types of challenges I can expect to  face as a  researcher in corporate America.? As my primary interests revolve  around the  use of derivatives and financial engineering in corporate risk  management,  Enron, as the leading innovator in these areas, would be an ideal  place to  learn.? I was wondering if you were aware of any openings at the  company  that might provide me with the exposure I am looking for.? If there  are no  such positions or opportunities, any advice or suggestions you could give   me,?such as whether or not you think such a ""sabbatical"" (for lack of a   better term) would be helpful, or information on private sector careers for   Ph.D.'s would be greatly appreciated.?  ?

Posting #1 APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE  POSTED May 23, 2000  Dear West Virginia Producer,  Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing  additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative  projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you  more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our  gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression  into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a  limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make  this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.  For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a  period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and  Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for  compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE  compressor station.  The Dominion ""bubbles"" affected are 4404 & 4405.    Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental  capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental  capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the  limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.   Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it  receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably  interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering  the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the  Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the  amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement.   Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing  time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure  that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other  producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression  in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights  to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more  requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for  which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.  Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the  proposed  location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include  the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression  agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation,  phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should  be included (please print or type).  Forward this information to:        Joseph A. Thompson     Manager, Business Development     Dominion Transmission Gathering & Production Division     500 Davisson Run Road     Clarksburg, WV  26301  After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a  determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the  capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after  June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.   Please realize that this is a ""window"" and the opportunity will close  after Noon on June 23, 2000.  I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value  of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on  this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at  (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may  have regarding this compression  ""open season"" request on Dominion Gathering.

2022-04-11 14:21:05+00:00,true,6,"  Hi - I just wanted to give you a quick run down on the meeting yesterday.   Three people spoke at the meeting - Jeff McMahon, Louise and Philippe.  There  was a lot of attention given to EnronOnline and it's success.  Greg Whalley  spoke via satellite from London.  The basic theme was what it is going to  take to survive in today's fast moving markets and how we are going to get  there, and that in five years all businesses will be Internet companies or  not companies at all.....    Greg spoke briefly about what we were going to do to upgrade and expand  existing platforms and the fact that no other player in the industry can do  this but us because of our financial capabilities, reputation, and IT  resources.    Louise went over statistics, products offered, etc. on EnronOnline.  Philippe discussed all the IT projects in the works - the key one for ENA was  enhancement of deal capture, valuation and settlements (no surprises  there!).  One other common theme was streamlining our current systems.   He  also confirmed the fact that we were moving from Lotus Notes to Exchange, and  discussed the fact that we were running out of space in the building for our  equipment (and the ability to keep the room cool) so they were looking to  Ardmore for this.    Jeff M. stated that we were looking for opportunities to capitalize on  inefficiencies in the market, and get into other industries (e.g. MG Metals  in Europe).  He also stated that Enron was going to Venture Capitalists for  financial support and backing.  Of course, this means that Enron will have to  give up some control, but it leads to increased deal flow, market share and  new ideas....  He said the initial backing will be in the neighborhoods of  $1B - most likely in Q3.    I tried to capture the main topics, let me know if you have any questions!

Is it currently consistent across all regions or is it handled  differently by different traders?  Please explain this in further detail. The  Basis roll-off was done in the GRMS system in the past.  Is this still the  case?  If not, we need to capture these roll-off adjustments using  spreadsheets?

Iraq is trying to extract concessions from the US and threatens to shut down production as of Oct 1 (just in time for the US elections).  The source of this info is Phil Verlaeger (an oil analyst). He is very good but excessively concerned with Iraqi machinations. He is the source of news (reported by Friedman of the New York Times in his op-ed columns) about massive Iraqi trading in the oil futures markets. I personally discount this info: the volume and  transparency of the oil markets  would not support this type of huge scale operations by  Saddam's government. There may be some trading by Iraqi officials on the side.  Vince,An interesting piece of information from the oil markets.

I have already contacted intranet development  about updates - they don't have to do much except publish the document and  maybe add some headings, so IT resources are not really a problem.  As you  suggest, what would be great is if we can get some more content in terms of  well-explained introductions to various topics like value-at-risk, credit  risk and so on.  It should not be at too high a level and will probably have  to be written specifically for this purpose.

As you are aware, I sued them for breach.  The settlement  involved the elimination of all existing transactions between Ft. James and  Enron including the Wauna and Halsey power contracts.  It is my understanding  that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the Portland  shop.   The elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the  lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement I originated.  It seemed logical  to charge the Portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of $1.8M as  a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent  liability.  Lets discuss.

I personally like Bob a lot, and am  very interested in making sure that he is in the right role for him.  His  wife has MS in its most severe stages.  He was a manager previously, and we  jointly made the decision to reclassify him as a senior specialist in order  to reduce the expectations on him in his role at work.  He needs to be able  to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a  caregiver who is with his wife while he works.  I made a personnal commitment  to him to make sure that his work load would allow a reasonable and  predictable end to his work day, and as long as he is in my group I will  personally make sure that works for him.  I would hope for him that if he  ever considered a change that a new boss would be able to do the same.    Danny contacted me about Bob, more from the standpoint of asking me what  impact it would have on gas if he moved.  I suggested that Brent would be  better able to address that.  I did tell Danny that the onslaught of EOL  transactions has been a challenge for gas confirmations, and I am sure that  they are not long on people.

Posting #1 APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE  POSTED May 23, 2000  Dear West Virginia Producer,  Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing  additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative  projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you  more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our  gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression  into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a  limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make  this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.  For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a  period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and  Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for  compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE  compressor station.  The Dominion ""bubbles"" affected are 4404 & 4405.    Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental  capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental  capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the  limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.   Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it  receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably  interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering  the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the  Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the  amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement.   Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing  time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure  that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other  producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression  in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights  to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more  requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for  which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.  Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the  proposed  location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include  the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression  agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation,  phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should  be included (please print or type).  Forward this information to:        Joseph A. Thompson     Manager, Business Development     Dominion Transmission Gathering & Production Division     500 Davisson Run Road     Clarksburg, WV  26301  After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a  determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the  capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after  June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.   Please realize that this is a ""window"" and the opportunity will close  after Noon on June 23, 2000.  I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value  of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on  this opportunity to add compression.

I have some observations to make from my reading (and re-reading) of the  account:  1 It looks like the old ""undue influence"" problem again. It seems some  attempts were made by operations to follow up, but nothing happened.   We tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we don't  have any way to protect them if they do - there is still the fear that if  they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career. And that  is because twice a year, at the PRC, that can happen. This incident shows  some of these attributes.  For the operations process to be effective there has to be (and be seen to  be) little significant influence from Commercial Groups over the ranking of  the operations staff.   2 Whoever signed off the new deal lists in the DPR should be asked to confirm  the basis on which they signed it.  3 Why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers ? Brokerage is in  the P&L and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage  is at the agreed rate, they should simply pay the brokerage.  4 Two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable - it should be done same  day. I would not have waited for the traders to do it, but I would want to  know why it took them so long.  5 Given that these (short) trades were absent from the portfolio during a  highly volatile period of rising prices, I would wonder about motivation in  addressing the position during this time. Essentially, if it had been correct  we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did.  I would pursue explanations to points 2, 4 and 5.

The 'late' deals were done on the 3rd of February (Marcello Romano) and the  30th of March (Haakon Olafson) and were both forward starting sells for  periods in 2003-2004.  Background  1) Input errors  For some considerable time we have been concerned with the number of deal  input errors that have been occurring in the Gas area with the most  significant number coming form the UK Gas traders. Numerous errors have been  found by documentation and risk management over the accuracy and timeliness  of entering deals into the 'blue book' (the Gas traders are currently the  only traders in Europe who do not enter their own trades into the valuation  system - there is currently a big push to change this which has the support  of John Sherriff with a deadline date of 31 July).  In the past documentation and gas risk management have repeatedly highlighted  booking errors to the gas traders but the error rate has not fallen. A log of  all deal input errors has been formally maintained since the beginning of May  which highlights an error rate of 12%-15% of non EOL trades. This has been  discussed with Richard Lewis and corrective action is expected.  2) Deal booking and reconciliation process (Non EOL trades)  Deals are initially written into the 'blue book' by the gas traders when the  deal is done. This book is photocopied several times a day and the deals are  the manually input into GasDesk by documentation on the same day.  Faxed broker statements are received (usually) by documentation the next day  and these are reconciled to GasDesk with errors and amendments made by  documentation liasing with the traders as necessary. At this time brokers  were faxing one statement per trade (relevant later).  3) New Deal sign off  As part of the daily DPR process a separate new deal sheet is prepared and is  signed off by the traders to formally agree the new deals done on the day and  the implied origination P&L. For the 3rd of February Marcello signed off the  new deals sheet and for the 30th of March Jonathan Whitehead signed off.  4) Documentation convention  In the gas market the convention is that the seller sends deal documentation.  (relevant later). Documentation aim to get this out within one the day after  trade booking.  5) Brokerage invoices  Brokerage invoices are usually received monthly by settlements who then  reconcile the trades on the invoice to the valuation system to ensure the  deal is valid before passing the reconciled invoice to the traders to  authorise for payment. Any deals which cannot be found are raised with  documentation who then investigate and follow up with the traders.   Specific details of these 'late' trades  1) Summary  For both these trades no evidence can be found of receiving, or can it be  established that we did not receive, a broker statement which is a primary  control in agreeing the existence and accuracy of new OTC deals.   As Enron was the seller in both cases no documentation was received from  either counterparty which would have alerted us to the trade.  The reconciliation of the brokerage invoices was carried out by settlements  in April and was completed by the 20th with the invoices falling due for  payment on the 27th. The work practice at that time was that brokerage  invoices (including those with non reconciling trade queries) were batched  together and passed to the traders. This would have taken place on the 27th  of April. Details on exactly what was said and done in the 3 weeks between  passing these invoices to the traders for approval (although there are claims  that verbal follow up were made on a number of occasions) and when a mailed  follow up was made on the 22nd of May are hazy. What is clear is that on the  22nd of May Morgan Stanley contacted Enron to try to confirm their position  which was when it was realised that an error could well have occurred.  Over the next two weeks tapes were then checked by the traders with the deals  being booked on the 6th of June.  2) Deal specifics  EES Broker - Morgan Stanley trade on 3 Feb 2000 Trader Marcello EES Invoice date 1 March; Invoice received before 15 March as settlements  started checking it. (Keren Perrott - settlements started on 13 March) Discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 May (Chris Ware to Emma Thomson) Traders contacted  on 24 May after copy of broker confirm was sent on 22 May  as requested by documentation to prove deal. Deal entered 6 June after traders checked the tapes.   IEB Broker - NP trade on 30 Mar 2000 Trader Haakon IEB invoice date 6 April; Invoice received before 27 April as settlements  started checking it. (Keren Perrott) Discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 May (Chris Ware to Robert Vaughn) Traders contacted on 24 May after copy of broker confirm was requested. Deal entered 6 June after traders checked the tapes.     Who was at fault and where did the control break down ?  I do not feel it is constructive to try to attach blame for what happened but  there are lessons to be learned and general observations and conclusions that  can be made and drawn.  Firstly there are major concerns over the Gas trader's accuracy and  prioritisation of booking trades. Despite numerous conversations on the  subject very little improvement has been seen. It has now got to the stage  where documentation are formally recording all errors including what the  error was and who made it. This is now being communicated to Richard Lewis  every two weeks with the aim being not only to reduce the amount of time  trade support spend correcting errors and re running DPRs but also to try to  avoid the incidence of errors such as this. The current error rate is 12% -  15% of non EOL trades. Documentation currently estimate that in 9 times out  of 10 the broker or counterparty are correct.  Secondly around a month ago we contacted brokers and asked for them to  provide us with one statement per day rather than one per deal which will  eliminate any lost statements or missed deals as it will be immediately  obvious when a statement from a broker has not arrived. Most brokers have now  changed but one or two still send one statement per trade. Reconciliation's  of these daily statements to GasDesk are evidenced.  Thirdly it has been impressed on both documentation and settlements to follow  up more vigorously (and by mail) errors and omissions on a more timely basis.  There is however a backlog or broker invoices which have have been checked by  settlements but have nto been checked or approved by the traders. This is  causing concern at the brokers who are chasing payment.  Action Points  Trading  Traders to input their own deals directly into GasDesk  Traders to improve their accuracy of deal booking  Traders to approve invoices on a more timely basis  Trade Support  Settlements to clear backlog of broker invoices  Documentation to chase brokers to send daily deal statements not individual  deal statements  All follow ups to be evidenced with mails used as appropriate  Documentation to check all trades since the beginning of the year versus the  broker records  Documentation to perform a reconciliation with all counterparties to agree  our forward position from July 2000 to September 2006 (the traded part of the  curve)           ","Thanks David, I am addressing the 'undue influence' issue via the PRC process, but we all know that this is a partial solution - it's about changing the culture (Europe isn't any better or worse in this respect) and this is a more in"

I take this opportunity to request of Shirley that, subject to your approval, an overhead projector, screen and small lectern be made available for the room where the 11:30 luncheon meeting takes place.

Posting #1 APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE  POSTED May 23, 2000  Dear West Virginia Producer,  Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing  additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative  projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you  more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our  gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression  into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a  limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make  this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.  For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a  period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and  Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for  compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE  compressor station.  The Dominion ""bubbles"" affected are 4404 & 4405.    Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental  capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental  capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the  limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.   Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it  receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably  interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering  the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the  Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the  amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement.   Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing  time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure  that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other  producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression  in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights  to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more  requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for  which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.  Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the  proposed  location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include  the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression  agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation,  phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should  be included (please print or type).  Forward this information to:        Joseph A. Thompson     Manager, Business Development     Dominion Transmission Gathering & Production Division     500 Davisson Run Road     Clarksburg, WV  26301  After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a  determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the  capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after  June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.   Please realize that this is a ""window"" and the opportunity will close  after Noon on June 23, 2000.  I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value  of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on  this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at  (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may  have regarding this compression  ""open season"" request on Dominion Gathering.

2022-04-11 03:16:06+00:00,true,6,"  As requested, I've created a list of people who: have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers/companies or I think would be a great asset to Enron.  I've jotted down what I know about each person and I hope you find it  useful.  I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.  If  you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact  them, just let me know.  Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management  practice.  Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client  related), he left the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit  and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.   I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend  him to Enron.  The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to  travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not  interested in leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807  0040.  Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in  Houston.  We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for  Coral Energy and Equiva trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for  15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader,  products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery  itself as an engineer).  Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are  extremely impressed with his knowledge and background.  I would highly  recommend him for a leadership role at Enron.  I spoke to him yesterday and  he is interested in talking with you.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.   His cell phone number is 713 412 3890.  Alan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).  He works  with my husband.  I know him on a personal basis.  He is trying to find  opportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319  2000).  Marilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of  accounting for derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and  all mtm accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all  products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.   She was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.  She is extremely  diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have  to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a  client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at  the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year  as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to  me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase,  and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that  she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713  277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it  due to the PwC/alliance relationship.  Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a  year, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit  manager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very  conscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try!  (713 230 3000 general line).  Kim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred  over from KPMG.  I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing  what she had expected at AA.  I don't know her number but you could reach her  at the general AA line.  Kevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.  I do not  know him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the  audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).  Keith Considine - He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best  senior PwC Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have  ever worked with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of  work experience (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked  for me on the Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent  evaluation from both myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of  the best people any of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working  on a project at one of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office  processes .  He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of  PwC, but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to  manager.  I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1  this year, but due to capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will  be approved. Since I've only been with Enron a short time and would like to  continue good relations with PwC, I would appreciate whoever contacts Keith  to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name. His  number is 713 356 5617.  Dave Simpson - analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting  and has work experience of about 9 months.  He is very interested in leaving  Koch.  I know him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a  good guy and very likeable.  I don't have his phone number, but should be  reachable through the general number for Koch.  Admin assistants  Connie Shugart - she is currently working at PwC as an administrative  assistant.  She is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for  PwC's audit and internal audit service lines.  She is very interested in  Enron and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here.  I have not  worked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office I talked  to her a number of times and was very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC  number).  Ellen Robertson - She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave  PwC.   I have never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on  how she should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).","As requested, I have created a list of people who have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers/companies or I think would be a great asset to Enron.

Enron's president and                     chief operating officer is engineering a fundamental  strategy shift at the                     Houston energy company, aimed at making it a dominant  ""new economy""                     player across various industrial markets.                       The Dollars 446m acquisition last month of MG, the  UK-based metals trader,                     is only the first of more than Dollars 1bn in estimated  new investments the                     company is targeting.

He                     argues the electronic platforms it creates will not only  become the principal                     B2B sites for those sectors, but reshape those  industries.                       As an example, he points to Enron's new e-commerce  platform, EnronOnline,                     which has changed the way the company does business with  its customers                     while significantly increasing sales.                       The company - the largest wholesale merchant of natural  gas and power - saw                     wholesale, physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53  per cent in the first                     quarter.                       Critics argue that Enron's move away from its familiar  energy business into                     new industries, where the learning curve is steep and the  competition                     entrenched, is risky. Yet a number of industry analysts  point out Enron has                     proved it understands markets and how to manage risks  while becoming the                     largest importer of coal in the UK, the largest trader of  gas and power in the                     US and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth.                       ""It's a prudent strategy, but it's got to be done in an  orderly way,"" says Ronald                     Barone, analyst with Paine-Webber in New York. ""What  they're doing here is                     what they've been incredibly successful at doing,"" he  adds, noting that Enron                     posted Dollars 1.3bn in earnings before interest and  taxes (ebit) from its                     wholesale energy and services business in 1999, up 34 per  cent from the                     previous year.                       Earnings from that division accounted for two-thirds of  the company's overall                     income before interest and taxes last year, and Mr Barone  sees the unit's ebit                     increasing 15-30 per cent annually over several years.                       As with gas and power and now broadband, where Enron is  standardising                     contracts and creating a market in bandwidth, it wants to  create markets by                     entering as a physical player and providing merchant,  risk management and                     financial services over the internet.                       ""We will provide electronic commerce, but we will provide  liquidity and we will                     provide settlement, or fulfilment of that contract,"" Mr  Skilling says. ""That is an                     extremely powerful model. If you look at other B2B sites,  they don't do that.""                       Mr Skilling argues Enron's e-commerce platform will  triumph over the other,                     bulletin board-type exchanges, where striking a deal  depends on two parties                     hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing,  price, credit and                     fulfilment.                       Not everyone shares that view. Some energy companies, for  example, would                     rather not do business with a competitor. BP Amoco  recently purchased a 3                     per cent stake in Altra Energy Technologies, a Houston-  based, neutral                     wholesale energy exchange. With Koch Industries and  American Electric                     Power, it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of  transactions on the                     site to lend it liquidity.                       Just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals,  Enron believes it                     needs networks of strategic physical assets. In acquiring  MG, Enron got a                     stable of warehouses, lending it a strong physical  position.                       ""It should provide (MG) with a more vibrant, more active  physical spot market                     in more markets in the world,"" says Greg Whalley, chief  executive officer of                     Enron Net Works, the new division Enron is launching to  identify and enter                     commodity markets. He argues that in metals and other  markets, Enron will                     deliver better pricing, price risk management services,  cross-commodity                     transactions and flexible transactions for a wider range  of customers.                       Mr Skilling says there are significant rewards for  restructuring an industry.                       ""If you can take that platform, and you use the  capabilities the bricks bring to                     the table, e-commerce the industry and change the  structure, you're selling for                     more than a 50 multiple.""

2022-04-11 13:49:51+00:00,true,6,"  Sorry to hear about this one.   I have some observations to make from my reading (and re-reading) of the  account:  1 It looks like the old ""undue influence"" problem again. It seems some  attempts were made by operations to follow up, but nothing happened.   We tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we don't  have any way to protect them if they do - there is still the fear that if  they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career. And that  is because twice a year, at the PRC, that can happen. This incident shows  some of these attributes.  For the operations process to be effective there has to be (and be seen to  be) little significant influence from Commercial Groups over the ranking of  the operations staff.   2 Whoever signed off the new deal lists in the DPR should be asked to confirm  the basis on which they signed it.  3 Why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers ? Brokerage is in  the P&L and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage  is at the agreed rate, they should simply pay the brokerage.  4 Two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable - it should be done same  day. I would not have waited for the traders to do it, but I would want to  know why it took them so long.  5 Given that these (short) trades were absent from the portfolio during a  highly volatile period of rising prices, I would wonder about motivation in  addressing the position during this time. Essentially, if it had been correct  we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did.  I would pursue explanations to points 2, 4 and 5.

Fernley    James New 09/06/2000 10:03 To: Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Mike  Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Robert Yeo/LON/ECT@ECT, Gail Hill/LON/ECT@ECT, Ian Sloman/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors - o1.1m hit   On the 7th of June Gas Risk Management became aware that two'late' trades had  been entered into the gas trader's 'Blue book' which were both being booked  significantly late and had a material negative P&L impact (negative o1.1m).  The 'late' deals were done on the 3rd of February (Marcello Romano) and the  30th of March (Haakon Olafson) and were both forward starting sells for  periods in 2003-2004.  Background  1) Input errors  For some considerable time we have been concerned with the number of deal  input errors that have been occurring in the Gas area with the most  significant number coming form the UK Gas traders. Numerous errors have been  found by documentation and risk management over the accuracy and timeliness  of entering deals into the 'blue book' (the Gas traders are currently the  only traders in Europe who do not enter their own trades into the valuation  system - there is currently a big push to change this which has the support  of John Sherriff with a deadline date of 31 July).  In the past documentation and gas risk management have repeatedly highlighted  booking errors to the gas traders but the error rate has not fallen. A log of  all deal input errors has been formally maintained since the beginning of May  which highlights an error rate of 12%-15% of non EOL trades. This has been  discussed with Richard Lewis and corrective action is expected.  2) Deal booking and reconciliation process (Non EOL trades)  Deals are initially written into the 'blue book' by the gas traders when the  deal is done. This book is photocopied several times a day and the deals are  the manually input into GasDesk by documentation on the same day.  Faxed broker statements are received (usually) by documentation the next day  and these are reconciled to GasDesk with errors and amendments made by  documentation liasing with the traders as necessary. At this time brokers  were faxing one statement per trade (relevant later).  3) New Deal sign off  As part of the daily DPR process a separate new deal sheet is prepared and is  signed off by the traders to formally agree the new deals done on the day and  the implied origination P&L. For the 3rd of February Marcello signed off the  new deals sheet and for the 30th of March Jonathan Whitehead signed off.  4) Documentation convention  In the gas market the convention is that the seller sends deal documentation.  (relevant later). Documentation aim to get this out within one the day after  trade booking.  5) Brokerage invoices  Brokerage invoices are usually received monthly by settlements who then  reconcile the trades on the invoice to the valuation system to ensure the  deal is valid before passing the reconciled invoice to the traders to  authorise for payment. Any deals which cannot be found are raised with  documentation who then investigate and follow up with the traders.   Specific details of these 'late' trades  1) Summary  For both these trades no evidence can be found of receiving, or can it be  established that we did not receive, a broker statement which is a primary  control in agreeing the existence and accuracy of new OTC deals.   As Enron was the seller in both cases no documentation was received from  either counterparty which would have alerted us to the trade.  The reconciliation of the brokerage invoices was carried out by settlements  in April and was completed by the 20th with the invoices falling due for  payment on the 27th. The work practice at that time was that brokerage  invoices (including those with non reconciling trade queries) were batched  together and passed to the traders. This would have taken place on the 27th  of April. Details on exactly what was said and done in the 3 weeks between  passing these invoices to the traders for approval (although there are claims  that verbal follow up were made on a number of occasions) and when a mailed  follow up was made on the 22nd of May are hazy. What is clear is that on the  22nd of May Morgan Stanley contacted Enron to try to confirm their position  which was when it was realised that an error could well have occurred.  Over the next two weeks tapes were then checked by the traders with the deals  being booked on the 6th of June.  2) Deal specifics  EES Broker - Morgan Stanley trade on 3 Feb 2000 Trader Marcello EES Invoice date 1 March; Invoice received before 15 March as settlements  started checking it. (Keren Perrott - settlements started on 13 March) Discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 May (Chris Ware to Emma Thomson) Traders contacted  on 24 May after copy of broker confirm was sent on 22 May  as requested by documentation to prove deal. Deal entered 6 June after traders checked the tapes.   IEB Broker - NP trade on 30 Mar 2000 Trader Haakon IEB invoice date 6 April; Invoice received before 27 April as settlements  started checking it. (Keren Perrott) Discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 May (Chris Ware to Robert Vaughn) Traders contacted on 24 May after copy of broker confirm was requested. Deal entered 6 June after traders checked the tapes.     Who was at fault and where did the control break down ?  I do not feel it is constructive to try to attach blame for what happened but  there are lessons to be learned and general observations and conclusions that  can be made and drawn.  Firstly there are major concerns over the Gas trader's accuracy and  prioritisation of booking trades. Despite numerous conversations on the  subject very little improvement has been seen. It has now got to the stage  where documentation are formally recording all errors including what the  error was and who made it. This is now being communicated to Richard Lewis  every two weeks with the aim being not only to reduce the amount of time  trade support spend correcting errors and re running DPRs but also to try to  avoid the incidence of errors such as this. The current error rate is 12% -  15% of non EOL trades. Documentation currently estimate that in 9 times out  of 10 the broker or counterparty are correct.  Secondly around a month ago we contacted brokers and asked for them to  provide us with one statement per day rather than one per deal which will  eliminate any lost statements or missed deals as it will be immediately  obvious when a statement from a broker has not arrived. Most brokers have now  changed but one or two still send one statement per trade. Reconciliation's  of these daily statements to GasDesk are evidenced.  Thirdly it has been impressed on both documentation and settlements to follow  up more vigorously (and by mail) errors and omissions on a more timely basis.  There is however a backlog or broker invoices which have have been checked by  settlements but have nto been checked or approved by the traders. This is  causing concern at the brokers who are chasing payment.  Action Points  Trading  Traders to input their own deals directly into GasDesk  Traders to improve their accuracy of deal booking  Traders to approve invoices on a more timely basis  Trade Support  Settlements to clear backlog of broker invoices  Documentation to chase brokers to send daily deal statements not individual  deal statements  All follow ups to be evidenced with mails used as appropriate  Documentation to check all trades since the beginning of the year versus the  broker records  Documentation to perform a reconciliation with all counterparties to agree  our forward position from July 2000 to September 2006 (the traded part of the  curve)        ","Sorry to hear about this one.

Best regards  Shona  Senior level risk people  Andy Dunn until 3 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management practice.  Due  to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client related), he left  the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit and the non-audit  personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  I have worked  with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend him to Enron.   The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to travelling a lot,  but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not interested in  leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 0040.  Mark (Allan) Smith Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in Houston.  We worked  very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for Coral Energy and Equiva  trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 15 years where he had  many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, products trader, he worked  in the risk management department, in the refinery itself as an engineer).   Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are extremely impressed with his  knowledge and background.  I would highly recommend him for a leadership role  at Enron.  I spoke to him and he is interested in pursuing opportunities at  Enron.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  His cell phone number is 713 412  3890.    IT/Risk people   Shawn lafferty, Alan Beaton, & Carolyn Johnson These people are all senior managers in KPMG's Information risk management  department and are all looking for opportunities outside KPMG.  They all have  8+ years work experience in the IT field.  KPMG's main number is 713 319 2000.   Mid level risk people   Marilyn Chee  She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of accounting for  derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and all mtm  accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all  products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.   She was my main contact at Equiva when I was their auditor.  She is extremely  diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have  to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a  client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at  the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year  as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to  me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase,  and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that  she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713  277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it  due to the PwC/alliance relationship.  Scott Barnes Scott is an audit manager at PwC.  He has worked in energy for his career,  which he spent in Houston and Moscow and New York.  He has worked as an audit  manager, a special projects manager for the managing partner of the Houston  office, a manager in the capital markets group (the group responsible for  helping non-US companies prepare to register and list with the SEC), and the  transaction support group (the group that is resposnible for performing due  diligence procedures for PwC clients).  He is looking for opportunities  outside PwC.  The PwC general line is 713 356 4000.  Keith Considine He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best senior PwC  Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have ever worked  with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of work experience  (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked for me on the  Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent evaluation from both  myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of the best people any  of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working on a project at one  of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office processes .  He definitely  does not see himself as a long time employee of PwC, but is currently  planning on staying there until he is promoted to manager.  I actually  recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 this year, but due to  capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will be approved. His  number is 713 356 5617.   Junior level risk people  Robin Manspeaker  currently works as a scheduler at Equiva Trading.  She has been there about a  year and a half.  Before that, she worked at Novarco in White Plains (a  subsidiary of Marc Rich).  She was there about 3 years.  I do not know where  she was before that.  I have worked with her during my audits of Marc Rich.   She seemed very well versed in her knowledge of her job and processes  surrounding it. I do not have her number, but you can call Shell information  at 713 241 6161 and they will transfer you.  Dave Simpson Analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting and has work  experience of about 2 years.  He is very interested in leaving Koch.  I know  him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a good guy and  very likeable.  His phone number is 713 544 7649  Robert Hernandez is someone who may be able to fill an open position at Enron South America.   Last year, Robert worked for me at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on the  external audit of Coral Energy.  He was a great worker and very good at his  job.  He speaks fluent Spanish as well as fluent English.  Before working at PwC, Robert worked in the gas trading industry in the  mid/back office.  I'm not sure of all of his responsibilities, but I do know  he was involved in gas actualizations. In total, I think he has about 4 years  of work experience.  He left PwC in March to take a position with Heins in their internal audit  department.  I have not spoken to him since he left, but do know he paid a  recruiter to find him this position.  I do not know if he is happy at his  current company or not.  I do not know his number, but he can surely be found by using the general  line.  I looked it up for you and came up with two - 713 785 1494, 713 225  0565.   Admin assistants   Connie Shugart she is currently working at PwC as an administrative assistant.  She is also  involved in recruiting experienced personnel for PwC's audit and internal  audit service lines.  She is very interested in Enron and has asked me a few  times to get her a contact here.  I have not worked directly with her but due  to her close proximity to my office I talked to her a number of times and was  very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC number).  I have spoken to her  about giving her name to Tony and she is very excited about coming over and  interviewing.  She really wants to work for Enron!  Ellen Robertson She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave PwC.   I have  never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on how she  should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).","Here is a revised summary of the 13 candidates I sent to Tony Vasut. I believe he has made initial contact with each of them, so if you decide you would like to talk to them, please don't mention my name, as some of them are former clients of mine,"
2022-04-11 18:08:21+00:00,true,6,"  We can continue the discussion in Tuesday's conference call, but I discussed  with Ben about the issues below, and here are some thoughts.  This is NOT a  complete approach, but only a starting point for discussion.  The main task is to build a pricing system for many names. This has two components ---  1) How to price a single name?  1.1) How to price a liquid single name?  1.2) How to price an illiquid single name? 2) How to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names?  The approach I would take for 1.1 is  a) Define a small set of liquid names b) Apply each of the different models we have, say, the six models Ben has  mentioned below, to these names c) Include market prices, if any, for these names d) Sit with traders, get trader's intuition on where each liquid name should  price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in (b) and (c) e) Try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion  of the trader prices across the models f) Quantify these attributes, if possible g) Try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process, and see if the  decisions in the last round still make sense  The approach for 1.2 may be a) Define a small set of illiquid names b) Apply each of the different models we have to these names c) Sit with traders, get trader's intuition on where each illiquid name  should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in (b) d) Try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion  of the trader prices across the models e) Check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names f)  Define a master set of liquid names g) Look for relationships (by analyzing cross-section of data) between  attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names   Once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names  and their attributes, then this mapping can be entered into a table, and the  pricing can be automated for all names (IN THEORY)!  The success will depend  on the success of the round-table sessions for the approaches for 1.1 and  1.2.    Building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task, but we can get  going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any  new models that we may build.  New models can be added to the suite of  existing models. I do not believe there will ever be a single model that will  answer all questions for all names, but rather we can refine the mappings and  relative choices among models over time, which would mean continuing  round-table sessions with traders.  Limited data makes calibration very hard,  so I would continually ask the question ""What do we calibrate?"" throughout  the discussions for 1.1 and 1.2, and this may help guide us to new models.

Most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information,  making the challenge harder, and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage. What we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective.  Currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development: FMC Model (default probability approach). Using Bloomberg's Fair Market (par  yield) Curves, probabilities are generated from the risky-LIBOR, then  default/bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology. FMC Model (credit spread approach). Using the FMCs, then directly taking the  LIBOR credit spread at each tenor, adjusting for basis and compounding  differences. Bond Model (FMC approach). Taking the FMCs as benchmark curves, the model  regresses the input bonds (specific to a name) on the two best fitting  benchmarks. The result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the FMCs,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer. Prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches. Under testing. Bond Model (spline approach). Taking only the bonds specific to an issuer,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero-coupon price curve,  then builds a zero yield curve from this. Under testing. Market Prices. For certain liquid names, or sectors/ratings, CDS market  prices are used, then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices. KMV. Using Expected Default Frequencies (EDFs) from the KMV model and  database, we will build a model to price default swaps, making appropriate  risk adjustments. KMV is being installed now, so model will be worked on next.  Each of these models returns a price (credit default and bankruptcy), and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and CDS markets, recovery assumptions, risk premia,  capital charges, etc. The aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible, based upon these models, then use these prices, alongside  other financial information, as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system.   Our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers, alongside name-specific 'soft' data from  credit reports and financial statements. If the credit is liquid enough, a  price will be generated from their own information only. Otherwise, the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits, with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights.  The model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market (or trader) prices, and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition. In loose terms, we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices (bonds, equities, default swaps), where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis, financial ratios, etc.  The key steps to implementing such a system will be: Establishing what exactly we want to 'predict' - is it a price, a rating, a  probability, or a score? We will need a clean market history to calibrate to,  which we only really have for ratings. We will then need to develop a mapping  from rating/score to price. Getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model. Building the mechanics of the model, ie, the calibration methodology. Neural  nets/fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates, but which exact methods and  software packages to use? Determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model. Getting the ""true"" market price, in order to feed back an error. At present  such a price exists for very few credits. Allocating resources to the development. McKinsey claimed such a system would  take 6-10 man-months to develop.  Further ideas or comments are requested, as we need to develop our strategy  asap. The model description above is fairly vague, as we don't yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details. Further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at 'internet speed'.

At this point, August 18-20 is available, but the 25-28 is not.  If we can  get this signed prior to 7/31/00, your $6000 credit would be able to be  applied to this event.  Please let me know if this will work for you.  Thanks!

I know after the last fiasco with an Enron offsite you are probably running for the hills!  I do want to apologize to you and thank you for all of your assistance even though we were unable to make the trip.  However, I understand there has been an arrangement made with Enron, that if we book a time and come before Thanksgiving we can recoup the money that we forfeited?  Please let me know if I am understanding this correctly.  If so, we have been told that our group can use this for an offsite.  We are looking at the weekends of August 18, 19 and 20 or August  25, 26 and 27th.  There will be approximately 12 people.

Based on the production dates of deal# 280185 and #226563, as combine with  the fact and that I can not find anything in the CES deal listing (CES  'books') specifying a 333/day deal with Statoil I am again hesitant to use  the CES prefix (nor can I confirm that deal #226563 should have been entered  with the CES prefix.

I've removed the gas storage pricing example, and instead put in a simple  example to show that my method can reproduce decision tree approaches (should  one wish to do so).  This is a response to the heavily decision-tree  dominated approach taken by most people at the last conference I spoke at.  I  want to demonstrate explicitly that my approach covers both decision tree and  option pricing as special cases, the synthesis needed for correct real option  valuation.  My presentation now covers: 1. Decision trees. 2. Binomial option pricing trees. 3. Power station valuation. 4. Power asset development. The option pricing and power examples are based on the (too simplistic)  binomial tree method.  I obviously won't indicate my thoughts on the most  correct way to do this.

You  should check with Heidi Boyd @ CES for the actual noms into the pool.  She  should have nominated these volumnes into CES's pool since ENA does not have  a pool. As far as I know, the pool to pool transfer fee is $0.04/Dth or $100.00 which  ever is LESS.  Therefore,  for volumes over 2,500 the transfer fee should be  $100.00 no matter what the volume is.  Phillips' contract for 500 MCFD metered production  goes through NOVEMBER  (this volume may be less because of high line pressures). Power Gas Marketing's contract for 7,500 Dth /Month pool to pool goes through  OCTOBER.

It seems that might help jump start the plans around how  best to assimilate the business.  I had suggested my new hire, Shona Wilson,  as a potential resource and then there are several of us who have already  been involved in doorstep reviews that could be involved both in the US and  in other locations.  Brent has forwarded a memo to me from Naomi Connell  who  seems to be formulating a plan for the doorstep reviews.   I don't know the  names that she mentions (other than Tani Nath), and I am sure that she is  unaware of additional resources from Houston that could be used.  We can  hopefully talk about that tomorrow morning.    ","I hope that your holiday was wonderful. Nikki told me that you would be working from home today, but I decided not to bother you there.

Her name is Shona Wilson, and I do not know her extension.  She  was in orientation yesterday, and I will be meeting with her today from 9:30  to 10:30 to discuss her initial assignments, of which working with India is  one.   I will have her contact you later today.  Although she is new to  Enron, she has had extensive experience with Price Waterhouse Coopers in  internal audit, controls and process redesign for trading firms, both in the  US and in Europe.  She will work with other seasoned professionals on my team  to set up the infrastructure that is needed in India.   --Sally    To: Wanda Curry/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bill Gathmann/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT  Subject: Re: Enron Trading    Wanda/Sally,  Can I talk to the person sometime today or tomorrow?. Please provide me with  the name and tel no. Thanks and Regards.  Milind     Wanda Curry@ECT 19-05-2000 08:49 PM To: Milind Laad/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: Enron Trading    I had a chance to review your presentation.  Bill and I have been working  with Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a  resource to help  insure all internal controls (specific to  trading activities) are in place  in India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as  an origination unit  with the London office being responsible for supplying  the coal.  Therefore, the net Enron position will probably be carried in the  London books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to  determine the net  MTM  for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.  These  books should include both the intercompany purchase from London  and the 3rd  party sales.  The commercial group in India  will be responsible for local  curves  (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and  energy operations (this will probably be you  initially until the trading  activity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process  (including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management  administration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting  will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general  ledger and financials.    There will also be a logistics process.   The  following questions need to be addressed:      With the increased  coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be  required?       My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for  determining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the        policy, if necessary.      What trading activities will be performed in India vs. London?       The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure  required for the India office.      Sally's employee starts on Monday,   I will let you know who she is and  arrange a call.    You can rest assured, that although this may seen  complicated (and it is), Sally's Energy Ops team will be able to hold your  hand all the way through this process.    It will be critical that we  demonstrate the control infrastructure is in place, before we can obtain  sigh-off for trading from Rick Buy.   Looking forward to helping you get this ready for a July 1 start date.

2022-04-11 06:59:54+00:00,true,6,"  The attached files contains our daily volume requirements for  5/31 and  the following day(s) as listed .    In each file there are three  worksheets labelled as follows:  'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".    The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed  at a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\JUN_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network. 'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current  gas day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was  in fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect  to the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that  we take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume' shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be  negotiated. 'Comments':  Please note that for the month of June '00 CES is purchasing additional  volumes of gas from Enron for delivery to MME behind COH under a separate deal.  The volumes shown here are entirely separate from the aforementioned deal.

Below is a list of deals that were impacted by her moving  all of the other meters.  I am bouncing the server and it wil take about 15  minutes to complete.  After that, you will have to get completely out of all  open Sitara applications (including the Launch Pad) and get back in.  Open  the deals listed below and make sure the location field on the deal exchange  says ""inconsistent"".  You should only be concerned with the exchanges for  6/1/00 and forward.  Click Edit and then go to the location field and click  on the ellipsis.  Click OK when the Facility dialogue box opens and the  correct zone should appear automatically.  Before you tab out of that field,  make sure that the deal volume equals the expected volume.  If the volumes  are not equal, make a note of the expected volumes and how they are broken  out because they will default to the deal volume as soon as you tab out.  If  the volumes are different, update them as necessary and then release the  deal.  Repeat this for all exchanges for 6/1/00 and forward and for all  deals.  The second thing you need to do is identify any swaps that are linked  to the physical forwards.  If none are linked then that's great because you  won't have to worry about that.  If some exist, you will have to update the  swap to reflect the correct zone.  To do this, you need to edit the swap, go  to the field location, remove the current (inconsistent) one and add the  correct zone.  Hopefully this makes sense.  Please call me if you have any  questions.  I will follow up with you on the meter 006335 tomorrow.

2022-04-11 18:02:01+00:00,true,6,"  John,  It seems to me that using a risk-free rate is not appropriate. I shall  elaborate on my  position and send you a longer message this afternoon (my time).  Vince         Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe    From:  John Bottomley                           06/19/2000 05:55 AM    To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Dale Surbey/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: Equity investment Fair Value in Turkey  Vince,  John Sherriff recommended that I contact you regarding an interesting (and  potentially contentious) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with  in London.  We hold longish term options in a private company in Turkey which  is currently seeking to IPO.  The issue we are discussing with RAC is which  discount rate (i.e., risk-free? and if so Turkish or US?) should we use to  value these options  First, some additional information.  Option characteristics: -- 116,000 options (representing 9% of the company) -- Term:  minimum of 3 years but possibly longer -- still being renegotiated -- Strike price:  20% below the upcoming IPO price (either priced in US$ or  Turkish Lire)  We currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $118.75  per option but 34,800 expire on July 15, 2000 with the remainder expiring on  December 15, 2000.  The company's investment bankers (ABN / AMRO Rothchilds)  are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at  $118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $300 million.  Due  to such a large ""valuation gap"", they originally encouraged us to exercise  all of the options by the end of June (IPO target date in late Sept / early  Oct).  Our counter-proposal is to ""swap"" instrinsic value for time value by  repricing the options strike higher while extending their term.  We are currently negotiating with RAC the most appropriate discount rate to  use to value the options.  We are arguing that the US risk free is the most  appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company's  historical senior debt cost (18%) is the more appropriate number to use  (although admit that this is not justifiable -- only a proxy)  A few key points: -- RAC is valuing the options via Crystal Ball simulations such that this ""to  be negotiated"" discount rate is used to calculate the PV of the future  options intrinsic value in 3 years  (i.e., for Black-Scholes, a higher discount rate yields a higher value but  the opposite is true using Crystal Ball simulation) -- The model simulates both an IPO / no IPO case and in the case of no IPO we  have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17% return -- The model assigns a 30% illiquidity discount -- In the simulated cases where the options are out-of-the-money, we  obviously do not exercise.  We understand that for Black-Scholes option valuation, one needs to be able  to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and  the risk free in order for the valuation to hold.  And here is where we reach  our difficulty:  since the company doesn't currently trade on a public market  and since equity futures do not exist for Turkish equities, RAC is arguing  that a US risk free is not appropriate to use.  Our argument is that the  non-IPO scenario, a 30% illiquidity discount and a US$ based option  volatility are already in the factored into the simulation.  As such, we feel  RAC's approach is double counting.  If you managed to get through the above, your a patient man!  I'll give you a  call today or tomorrow after you've had a chance to digest the information.  Regards, John Bottomley       ","John, It seems to me that using a risk-free rate is not appropriate.

2022-04-11 22:19:34+00:00,true,6,"  John,  I think the crucial distinction is between recognition of risks and  elimination of risks through hedges (as correctly pointed out  in other messages). Being  aware of risk does not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it.  Now a few more detailed comments.  1. I think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined  with  a project finance discount rate. Illiquidity discount, in my view, should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without  sufficient depth. One should apply a haircut if liquidating  a position takes a long time. The  approach used in valuation of the Turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of  investments in physical assets, which are by definition illiquid. This illiquidity  is recognized  through other aspects of valuation technology used in RAROC.   If we apply an illiquidity correction in this case, we should be consistent  and use this approach  across the board for all project finance type cases (not that  I recommend this course of action).  2. Valuation of an unheadgable options.  Let's look at it from the position of a seller of the option.  He cannot hedge a short call or put and Black-Scholes valuation becomes the  floor for the valuation: the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk (as  opposed to taking a vol risk when he hedges). The issue of the compensation he will require becomes  fuzzy. The option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on  two factors:  1. risk preference 2. existing portfolio positions  Risk preference. Insurance companies typically require a payment that  consists of two parts: expected loss + unexpected loss. The latter is typically defined as 1 to 2  standard deviations. The number of  standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability  to absorb the loss. I admit that it is a bit fuzzy, but this is the way the world works. We  looked into insurance pricing at the request of Jere Overdyke. You can talk to Vasant Shanbhogue to find out more  about it.  Existing portfolio positions. An additional contract may increase or decrease  the risk of the overall portfolio. I would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification, but it does not  look to me as a deal that reduces risk (given all our positions in this region).  What are the practical implications? Pricing depends on risk appetite (the  utility function of a decision maker in technical jargon) and becomes to some degree arbitrary.   If we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged, we should subtract from the value of the contract the value of the option (that is greater than the Black - Scholes value). If we don't price this option explicitly, the valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk  premium.  In the case of an option buyer, the situation is reversed. If he cannot  hedge, he should recognize the risk of losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of  the option. How big is the discount? See the comments above.   In the special case, where hedging is possible and the Black-Scholes-Merton  paradigm applies, both values will become equal (ignoring transaction costs). The values of an option form  the point of view of  a seller and a buyer will converge.  3. What happens in case we use simulation technology?  We can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario (each scenario will  recognize the downside and/or upside at different points in time in different states of the world). If we run a sufficient number of scenarios, we shall get a distribution of  NPV as of today. Knowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk, but in most cases  we are still holding it. The expected value should be, therefore, adjusted for risk. This is  equivalent to using a  discount rate with a risk premium.  I hope this helps. Please, call me with additional questions. Sorry for a  delay in responding to this question. I ran my response by Stinson and Vasant, to make sure we  all agree. It's a very complicated technical problem and the financial theory does not  have good answers.

If you want to be that retainer client, that would be of interest to me.  Give me a shout via return email or by my cell phone at 650.218.3069 regarding schedule.  I am out of town this week but available via email or phone at the above addresses.  I really hope we can get together that week if we possibly can.  Thanks very much for considering my request, and thanks very much for being the go between with your investment guy.  I deeply appreciate it.  I hope to see you on the 5th or 7th.  Dale Nesbitt","Vince: I plan to be in Houston on July 5-7.

I would like to continue the discussions about your using MarketPoint and about your investment guy"

2022-04-11 19:24:55+00:00,true,6,"  Hi Dorn & John, as you discovered recently, I am still 'officially' in Vince  Kaminski's group (my original Enron Corp. group). This holds true for Shalesh  Ganjoo as well.  I did not explicitly pick Dorn or John as reviewers thinking  that they will show up automatically as a result of my assumed reporting  structure.    So, Vince has agreed to 'host' the review in his group and proceed to  transfer me over to EBS officially when this quarter is overs (Apprently that  was scheduled to be automatic).  In the mean time, Vasant, Stinson or Vince  would like to get a e-mail from either Dorn or John regarding my performance  from their perspective for consideration as soon as possible.  I had plan on being on vacation starting tomorrow and have made arrangement  with my family already.  Since I am not reviewing Shalesh directly (since he  is in Research under Stionson), I am assuming I don't have to attend the  review meetin tommorrow. I'll be on the road starting in the morning.  If I  change this, I am told at home, that I will be in the market for another  family!  I can phone in if that is okay.   Kayla, could you page me with the details?  Regards,   Ravi.","Hi Dorn & John, as I discovered recently, I am still 'officially' in Vince Kaminski's group (my original Enron Corp. group). This holds true for Shalesh Ganjoo as well.

2022-04-11 02:39:35+00:00,true,6,"  I found a couple of big adjustments on the April capcity sheet.  I am still  billing CES for the Union Camp capacity and it was terminated effective  3/31/2000.   The net impact is $64,104.00 that needs to be credited back to CES.    It also appears that I billed CES the scheduling fee of $20,000.00 twice.  Jeff, the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of $20,000.00  equals $1,865,705.00.  If we billed CES twice for the scheduling fee, then we  should  issue a credit to CES of about $84,000.00.  Please redraft deal  227081 and let me know what the impact is.  I would like to send out the  credit either today or tomorrow.  Thanks. cg","I found a couple of big adjustments on the April capcity sheet.
