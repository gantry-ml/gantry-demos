2022-04-14 08:11:17+00:00,true,3,"  Stuart:  Yes.  My view of the remaining activities is as follows:   #1. We (Mark Gershon/Karen Way/myself) are currently working with the  Village of Manhattan to fufil our obligation under the Annexation Agreement  to complete certain roadway improvements.  The Village has conducted a bid  process and selected a winning bidder to complete the work.  Unfortunately,  no bidders submitted a fixed price bid to the Village.  The Village wants us  to assume the financial risk (up to $500k) of any cost overruns.  We have  pointed out that the annexation Agreement does not require us to assume that  risk.  We are attempting to work this situation out with the Village.   #2. Karen Way is working with Chicago Title to bring to closure the issues  related to the pipeline lateral easements and obtain the title policy on the  entire lateral.  It was recently brought to our attention that during the  pipeline's construction the lateral was routed across a piece of People's  Energy property without an easement being executed.  The pipeline project  manager (Dave Lazzarro is currently working to obtain this easement).    Stuart:  Can you confirm for Karen/myself if the Northern Border easement was  recorded?   #3. Mark/myself are working with the Village and the plant manager on these  issues.  There are only a couple of improvements still remaining to be  completed including a ditch being re-graded and possibly a road re-graded  with gravel.  This should represent a small time commitment to close out.   #4.  Mark/myself are working with the Village on this issue.  We have  notified our surveyor of our need to prepare platts of dedication for the two  roadways bordering the project site.  The first one to be completed should be  Pauling road since that is the roadway that issue #1 relates to (the project  owns to the middle of the roadway - we do not wish construction workers  working on our property and creating any potential liability).   #5.  There are no current plans for expansion of the facility, so this item  should require negligible work.  We have filed an air permit application for  an additional 7FA turbine at the Project, but this is just to allow for  expansion if we choose to do so.  The annexation Agreement allows us to  expand the facility without any additional local approvals.  Additional:  I have had discussions with Merle Churchill (plant manager)  regarding the potential purpose of an 8 acre parcel nearby.  Merle has been  approached by a local electrical contractor who would like to relocate his  shop out to the county.  This 8 acre parcel would be ideal and would allow us  to close out a potential sound receptor necessary for the expansion turbine.   Also, the potential need for a special use permit for the generator lead  needs to be evaluated.  I will talk with Mark Gershon on this issue.  If we  decide to proceed, then this would likely be a 3-4 month project, similar to  what we completed on the facility last year.  In general, I am working to wrap up Piper Rudnick's(PR) work on the Lincoln  Energy Center ASAP.  With regard to other Illinois development sites (Pontiac  and Plano),  I have tried to keep the majority of the work to Mark Gershon  and Karen Way.  There have been some cases where others were needed and I  have tried to limit their roles to very short, specific engagements  (environmental, sound, real estate).  I met with Chris Townsend 3 weeks ago  and stressed our desire to have Mark and Karen handling the majority of the  development work (in my opinion, they are the best and most productive uses  of personnel at PR).  The rapid speed of our development activities at Plano  and Pontiac have required them to take on very integrated roles.  This pushes  the costs up but also is a big part of our successes, thereby eliminating the  need to re-complete numerous stages of the lengthy zoning process which exist  in Illinois counties.  Having said that, we need to watch PR and their  charges closely as they have a tendency to want to involve additional people  into our development activities.  Call me to discuss.

While the most significant annexation and zoning issues have been addressed by establishing the zoning and annexation agreement for the Lincoln Energy Center, there remain certain ongoing matters in which the firm may be involved, including the following:   1.   Finalizing the terms of the Roadway Construction Escrow Trust and Disbursing Agreement with the Village of Manhattan and addressing roadway construction issues.   2.  Completing the review of all pipeline easements with People's Energy and Chicago Title Insurance Company and securing the issuance of the final, master Title Policy.   3.  Completing those outstanding improvements on the facility property currently covered by the Corporate Guaranty in the possession of the Village of Manhattan.   4.  Completing the dedication of surrounding roadways.   5.  Addressing any potential expansion or modification of the Project.   Additionally, Fred Mitro has indicated that ENA may (a) acquire additional nearby property and/or (b) secure a final Special Use Permit over the Interconnection through Will County.   As always, please do not hesitate to contact me (312-368-4039), Mark Gershon (312-368-2127) or Karen Way (312-368-2152) if you have any questions.

That the son and daughter-in-law be made parties to the Agreement (they  currently own/reside in the home and have indicated they are ready to sign)  2.  That Titan LLC will pay the survey, title search and transfer fees as a  part of the closing costs of the property (approx $3-$5K)  The Ledford family understands that we wish to execute this Agreement prior  to conducting our zoning meetings next Monday and Thursday evening.

I am OK with all of John and Scott's proposed changes except the rider to replace paragraph 1(c), which deals with who has the risk/gatekeeper role on deciding whether an activity is ""hard cost"" or not.  While I would prefer to keep a ""Contractor shall not perform any ""hard cost"" activity"" -type prohibition in the contract, I understand that since financing is really an Owner issue, and Owner wants off-balance sheet financing, making sure no ""hard cost"" activity is performed is really an Owner issue.  Thus, I have taken their basic language/concept and modified it somewhat.  I have marked up EECC's proposed rider and attached the marked copy for your review.  If acceptable to the owner team, I will forward it to EECC for their review/approval.  Once we have agreement on this language, the Preliminary Eng Release Agmt should be done and ready for John Novak's review and approval and subsequent execution by ESA and EECC.  David E.

I just had a meeting cancel for tomorrow, which will help.  Kay     Rusty Stevens 09/18/2000 04:29 PM To: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron cc:    Subject: Re: Fehr Option Agreement    Kay,  We are in agreement on the x months date certain that the document needs to  end.  I have suggested that we propose one year.  If we dont extend the deal  for a second 18 month term, this actually ends the deal before the 3 year  overall contemplated date.    As to running it back through Accounting, I had hoped that we could avoid  that since its still not an obligation that we have except as a result of our  actions to begin construction of a facility, so as I see it there's no change  from the previous structure - its not a put - its an automatic call.    If I haven't talked you into it yet, and you feel it does need to go past  accounting again, please ask them to hurry since we have an incentive to get  it done quickly.  I dont recall what the paragraph 5 changes were, but we are in fact spending  a lot of time with Karen at this time to get the zoning approved at Pontiac.   This is why we are in a hurry.  We have to go for our zoning hearing on  October 5th and we know we are going to be asked about the two nearby houses  - Fehr and Ledford - and we want to be able to stand up and say that we too  were concerned about the impact on those residents and that we have  negotiated for the purchase of those homes so disturbance will be minimized.  I also don't want Mr. Ledford - who just got back from vacation - to go talk  to the Fehr's in the next day or so and make them re-think the deal we've  gotten done with them.  I know you're getting pulled in a lot of directions, and I appreciate the  help.         Enron North America Corp.

Second,  there has to be an absolute end to this agreement at some point. If we want  to have an automatic extension by commencing construction, there still needs  to be a date certain after which we can go forward without them no matter  what.  In other words, if we want to add the language Rusty suggested, it  should be limited to x months after the expiration of the option agreement.   We'll need to run this back through Accounting.  I really don't like the inclusion of the language in paragraph 5. If we add  the language requested in paragraph 5, we need to run this agreement back  through Accounting, and we may need to add some other additional language.    I don't know if Rusty and Fred think we may need a zoning change for this  parcel.  Kay        Rusty Stevens 09/14/2000 04:45 PM To: karen.way@piperrudnick.com, Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Fred Mitro/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Fehr Option Agreement  I am in receipt of the Fehr's comments to our option agreement.  In reviewing  them, I have the following comments:  The paragraph (2) change that says they can compel us to buy their land upon  a Triggering Event occurring is not going to work, because this is a put  option on their part which hurts our hard cost avoidance issues.  We  carefully reworded previous put option language to avoid this.    Also, how  can we be bound to a deal when the agreement has expired ?  I think we would  need to say that ""if we decide to build the plant after the option period  expires, then that would serve to extend the term of this agreement, however,  if the option agreement expires unexercised for a one year period then we  won't be bound to the deal.    If the provisions of his comment (5) are indeed parallel to another similar  paragraph in the document I don't have a problem with it, but ""specific  performance"" scares me in general.  Your (collective) call.   Lets wrap this one up fast.  I want to resolve it soon so I can use it as  leverage with Ledford and not have him influence them.  He picked a good to  go on vacation, but is back in on Monday.  I also told the Fehr's that if we  could do this before the 15th I would go for $185,000 vs. $175,000.  Since we  were about five days longer than promised, I can justify the delay to end of  next week, but I don't want them to think I was just blowing smoke on the  extra $10,000.   Fred :  Refresh my memory on who I need to go to for the option payment check  ?        ","As soon as I get a redline, I'll get it to Accounting and we can go forward quickly.

2022-04-14 17:27:33+00:00,true,3,"  Attached is the latest risk policy from Peoples.  It appears that they have  only made the one change that is highlighted.  However, I would request that  we all re-read the policy in its entirety to ensure that there are no other  changes which are not highlighted.  Vlady - here are some thoughts on your  comments.    1 - Stop limit size.  I don't think we will be succesful in trying to change  this at this point.  Peoples Board has been presented with the $10 million.   As we discussed, there can be no actions taken by the risk committee unless  unanimous and we can always try to change it once we get going.   2 - I changed Appendix I to reflect a Stop Loss Trigger limit determination  period of each fiscal year. 3 - There are no differences in notifications for the 50% and 75% levels.   The easiest thing to do may be to handle this internally if we want a  different notification at the higher threshhold.  It does not need to be a  formal part of enovate's policy unless we feel it absolutely necessary. 4 - The VaR language you provided has been incorporated as Appendix IV.  Overall, there have not been many changes.  I would like to get final  comments, subject of course to Peoples changing their minds on something, as  soon as possible.

Please review and discuss any comments with me or Mark Gershon.   PROPOSED CONDITIONS TO SPECIAL USE FOR LIVINGSTON ENERGY CENTER (the ""Facility"") TITAN LAND DEVELOPMENT CO., L.L.C. (""Titan"") SOUTHEAST INTERSECTION OF 1400 N. AND 1700 E. ROADS (the ""Property"")   1. The operation of the Facility shall satisfy all Illinois Environmental Protection Agency noise pollution requirements.  2. Titan shall enter into a roadway agreement with the County and Township Highway Commissioners under which Titan assumes responsibility for  repair of, maintenance of, and debris removal on Township and County roadways during construction of the Facility.  3. Contingent upon all property owners' written approval being secured, Titan shall have installed at most four monitoring wells on at most four properties within one and one-half miles surrounding the Property.  One monitoring well each shall be installed on a property to the north, south, east, and west.  Titan shall monitor well levels on each of the properties on a quarterly basis and shall make such monitoring information available to the County Engineer at his request for five years following issuance of the final Certificate of Occupancy.  If no adverse impact due to the operation of the Facility is found during the first five year monitoring period, then Titan shall monitor well levels for each of the properties two (2) times per year and shall make such monitoring information available to the County Engineer upon his request for the life of the Facility.  4. The [delete maximum] number of power generating units shall be limited to a maximum of ten (10).  5. Titan shall have repaired or replaced any drainage tile broken on the Property during construction and operation of the Facility that would adversely impact any surrounding property owner.  6. The site plan for the Facility shall allow no greater than forty percent (40%) of the site's total acreage to be developed with non-landscaped areas, open space, or agricultural uses [I don't think this is  quite correct -let's discuss]  7. Upon permanent cessation of use of the Facility as an electric generation facility, Titan shall remove all above ground buildings, equipment, footings, appurtenances and structures, including accessory buildings and equipment.  8. Titan shall make those stormwater improvements identified on the attached Stormwater Management Plan.  Additionally, a) upon adoption by Pontiac Township and Eppards Point Township of the Area-wide Stormwater Management study prepared by Farnsworth & Wylie (the ""Study"") for the Property and the surrounding area and b) upon written agreement to proceed with the stormwater management improvements identified in the Study by those property owners whose properties are identified by the Study as requiring stormwater management improvements, Titan shall commit to make those stormwater management improvements identified in the Study for the Property. Titan shall provide a corporate guaranty to the County in the amount of fifty-five thousand dollars ($55,000) with a C.P.I. escalator as security for  making those stormwater management improvements identified in the Study for the Property.  Titan shall construct such improvements contemporaneously with other such improvements being completed in the Study area.  9. Construction of each phase of the Facility from initiation to completion is estimated to require from six (6) to twelve (12) months subject to weather constraints, acts of God, materials availability, strikes and other labor issues, changes in regulations affecting development and construction, and other constraints not within the control of Titan.  Within twelve months following issuance of the final Certificate of Occupancy all improvements shall be completed and all construction equipment and trailers shall be removed.    Karen S.

As you may recall, we suggested that the draft Petition prepared by Peoples several weeks ago be revised to better explain the transactions which would occur under the Master Agreement and provide a basis for the ICC to conclude that approval of the agreement is in the public interest. At the time, Jerry said he generally agreed with the comments, but had to get more information from his client to finalize the Petition. His intent was to obtain the information in the form of draft testimony, which he has now done. My preliminary review indicates that the testimony, which would accompanying the Petition, is adequate. It explains the nature of the expected transactions, explains how Peoples' customers benefit from the transactions (i.e., why approval is in the public interest) and supports the compensation mechanism. Although the testimony is somewhat sketchy, it should be sufficient to initiate the review. The ICC Staff can ask for whatever additional information it wishes to consider. When I speak to Jerry, I plan to ask whether the initial draft Petition would be modified to discuss some of the information he now has. (I believe this could be easily done.) In any event, the basic information needed to support the filing seems to be there. Let me know of any comments. I will wait until I hear back before talking to Jerry Fox.

In order  to mark any 2000 income, we will need to get CRRA to execute the Development  Agreement in 2000.

I'll make sure Dan is in the loop on as much of that as he  cares to read.  I've heard a rumor of an issue regarding the authority of CRRA to purchase  the equipment (perhaps relating to the use of bond money for the purchase),  but haven't come up to speed on that issue yet.

If that  changes I will let you know.  As for your question regarding the amount, the  worksheet is simply an attempt to capture the potential maximum needs based  on certain assumptions.

As for Global  Finance, Sarah is back in the office so she will be handling the FASH.   Lastly, I am currently assuming that the Peoples loan will mirror our loan  with identical caps.

2022-04-14 06:56:53+00:00,true,3,"  I spoke with Wayne Duman last Thursday (9/21/00) to schedule a Enron VEPCO  meeting for September 29, 2000 to discuss VEPCO progress with the Facility  Study and processing/negotiating the Interconnect Agreement.  Wayne cancelled  that meeting later that same afternoon.  I spoke with him today in regarding  the reasons for cancellation.    As it turns out, his group--Bulk Power Delivery--is not the group executing  the PPA with Enron.  That group is Tim Talmadge's group--Capacity  Acquisition.  Once Wayne tried to schedule the 9/29 meeting, he was told not  to talk with Enron.  Further investigation on his part uncovered some  internal VEPCO issues.  He is calling an internal meeting with Capacity  Acquisition, Bulk Power Delivery, Bulk Power Operations and the Transmission  Group to discuss these issues and establish a consistent ""game plan"" for  going forward.  The Transmission Group is scheduled to finish the Facility Study on Monday,  October 2, 2000.  The study will include switchyard needs, network needs,  construction costs, and construction schedule.  He knows we have a June 2001  commercial operation date, and he knows that Capacity Acquisition is  responsible for the associated construction costs.  He is nervous that the  Facility Study will forecast construction schedules that do not coincide with  the commercial operation date.  He further indicated that acquisition of  necessary equipment--breakers, transformers, etc. specified by the Facility  Study--could be a significant challenge for VEPCO.  He understands that this  is his challenge, not ours.  He also noted that VEPCO is very sensitive and  careful to operate within FERC guidelines regarding interconnection and the  various time frames--this includes not making any special considerations to  the Capacity Acquisition guys since they are in the same company.  Wayne Duman is very involved in VEPCO's effort to develop an Interconnection  Agreement consistent with FERC.  They are within days of completing this  task--it is in legal review right now.  The current  version of the  Interconnection Agreement is a subsequent generation of the document we  reviewed at the beginning of August.  Wayne understands that the PPA which  VEPCO and Enron are negotiating is contardictory to the ""boiler plate""  Interconnection Agreement and needs to be changed to reflect the PPA defined  scopes for Enron and VEPCO.  He indicated that part of VEPCO's ""to do list""  to get ready to meet with Enron includes modification of the latest  generation of the VEPCO Interconnection Agreement to be consistent with the  Enron PPA.  He is optimistic that we would be able to meet late next week to get the  Interconnect Agreement process underway.  He assured me that he would keep  Enron informed of the progress.  In summary, VEPCO is doing the following: getting all stakeholders on the same page, finishing the Facility Study, and getting their Interconnection Agreement to agree with the PPA.

2022-04-14 02:06:07+00:00,true,3,"  Here are my observations:  I agree with Rusty re: the put option complicating things for us.  Second,  there has to be an absolute end to this agreement at some point. If we want  to have an automatic extension by commencing construction, there still needs  to be a date certain after which we can go forward without them no matter  what.  In other words, if we want to add the language Rusty suggested, it  should be limited to x months after the expiration of the option agreement.   We'll need to run this back through Accounting.  I really don't like the inclusion of the language in paragraph 5. If we add  the language requested in paragraph 5, we need to run this agreement back  through Accounting, and we may need to add some other additional language.    I don't know if Rusty and Fred think we may need a zoning change for this  parcel.  Kay         Rusty Stevens 09/14/2000 04:45 PM To: karen.way@piperrudnick.com, Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Fred Mitro/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Fehr Option Agreement  I am in receipt of the Fehr's comments to our option agreement.  In reviewing  them, I have the following comments:  The paragraph (2) change that says they can compel us to buy their land upon  a Triggering Event occurring is not going to work, because this is a put  option on their part which hurts our hard cost avoidance issues.  We  carefully reworded previous put option language to avoid this.    Also, how  can we be bound to a deal when the agreement has expired ?  I think we would  need to say that ""if we decide to build the plant after the option period  expires, then that would serve to extend the term of this agreement, however,  if the option agreement expires unexercised for a one year period then we  won't be bound to the deal.    If the provisions of his comment (5) are indeed parallel to another similar  paragraph in the document I don't have a problem with it, but ""specific  performance"" scares me in general.  Your (collective) call.   Lets wrap this one up fast.  I want to resolve it soon so I can use it as  leverage with Ledford and not have him influence them.  He picked a good to  go on vacation, but is back in on Monday.  I also told the Fehr's that if we  could do this before the 15th I would go for $185,000 vs. $175,000.  Since we  were about five days longer than promised, I can justify the delay to end of  next week, but I don't want them to think I was just blowing smoke on the  extra $10,000.

2022-04-14 02:38:38+00:00,true,3,"   HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--In the latest update of Enron Corp.'s (ENE, news, msgs)  bandwidth trading activities, the company's chairman said Tuesday that it has  completed about 90 trades of telecommunications bandwidth.   Speaking at the Dain Rauscher Energy 2000 Conference, Enron Chairman Ken Lay  talked about the current status and futures plans the company has for  bandwidth trading and broadband services.   Asked what kind of company Enron is, Lay gave an answer that shows the recent  expansion of the company's business strategy beyond energy. Enron is still  basically ""an energy and broadband company,"" he said.   While energy is still the source of most of Enron's revenue, Lay's answer  underlines the growth potential it sees in broadband services and bandwidth  trading. A number of Enron officials have been quoted in the last year as  saying that, in a few years, it could be making as much money from those  areas as it now makes from its lucrative natural gas and power businesses.   Enron plans to spend $600 million-$650 million this year and about the same  amount over the next two to three years on broadband and bandwidth trading,  Lay said. It will spend more during that time if necessary.   In fact, the company is planning to sell energy assets around the world in  emerging markets that aren't growing quickly enough to meet Enron's  standards. Proceeds will be deployed into businesses like broadband and  bandwidth trading, which are growing more quickly, he said.   In pioneering bandwidth trading as a commodity, Enron's 90 bandwidth deals  put it far ahead of competitors in that nascent market area. El Paso Energy  Corp. (EPG, news, msgs) officials have said they have done 5-10 bandwidth  trades this year. Companies like Williams Communications Group (WCG, news,  msgs) won't talk about the number of bandwidth trades they have made.   Bandwidth is the capacity to move data between two points on a  telecommunications network.   Enron will finish deploying its domestic telecommunications network by the  end of this year, Lay said. Some of the fiber-optic network will be lit, or  made operational, this year with the rest to be lit later.   The company has four bandwidth trading pooling points completed in New York,  Los Angeles, Las Vegas and London. Enron's current plans call for a total of  13 pooling points.   Bandwidth trading pooling points are facilities where telecom carriers can  connect to each other to allow data to flow from one carrier to another,  facilitating bandwidth trading.   Enron plans to begin delivering movies to home via broadband connections in  December as part of its deal with Blockbuster Video and a number of telecom  carriers.   The deal is a 20-year exclusive, worldwide deal with a potential contract  value of more than $1 billion to Enron, according to materials the company  handed out at the conference.

Please review and discuss any comments with me or Mark Gershon.   PROPOSED CONDITIONS TO SPECIAL USE FOR LIVINGSTON ENERGY CENTER (the ""Facility"") TITAN LAND DEVELOPMENT CO., L.L.C. (""Titan"") SOUTHEAST INTERSECTION OF 1400 N. AND 1700 E. ROADS (the ""Property"")   1.   The operation of the Facility shall satisfy all Illinois Environmental Protection Agency noise pollution requirements.  2.   Titan shall enter into a roadway agreement with the County and Township Highway Commissioners which assigns responsibility for repair of, maintenance of, and debris removal on Township and County roadways during construction of the Facility.  3.   Contingent upon all property owners' written approval being secured, Titan shall have installed at most four monitoring wells on at most four properties within one and one-half miles surrounding the Property.  One monitoring well each shall be installed on a property to the north, south, east, and west.  Titan shall monitor well levels on each of the properties on a quarterly basis and shall make such monitoring information available to the County Engineer at his request for five years following issuance of the final Certificate of Occupancy.  If no adverse impact due to the operation of the Facility is found during the first five year monitoring period, then Titan shall monitor well levels for each of the properties two (2) times per year and shall make such monitoring information available to the County Engineer upon his request for the life of the Facility.  4.   The maximum number of power generating units shall be limited to a maximum of ten (10).  5.   Titan shall have repaired or replaced any drainage tile broken on the Property during construction and operation of the Facility that would adversely impact any surrounding property owner.  6.   The site plan for the Facility shall allow no greater than forty percent (40%) of the site's total acreage to be developed with non-landscaped areas, open space, or agricultural uses  7.   Upon permanent cessation of use of the Facility as an electric generation facility, Titan shall remove all above ground buildings, equipment, footings, appurtenances and structures, including accessory buildings and equipment.   8.   Titan shall make those stormwater improvements identified on the attached Stormwater Management Plan.  Additionally, a) upon adoption by Pontiac Township and Eppards Point Township of the Area-wide Stormwater Management study prepared by Farnsworth & Wylie (the ""Study"") for the Property and the surrounding area and b) upon written agreement to proceed with the stormwater management improvements identified in the Study by those property owners whose properties are identified by the Study as requiring stormwater management improvements, Titan shall commit to make those stormwater management improvements identified in the Study for the Property. Titan shall provide a corporate guaranty to the County in the amount of fifty-five thousand dollars ($55,000) with a C.P.I. as security for making those stormwater management improvements identified in the Study for the Property.  Titan shall construct such improvements contemporaneously with other such improvements being completed in the Study area.   9.   Construction of each phase of the Facility from initiation to completion is estimated to require from six (6) to twelve (12) months subject to weather constraints, acts of God, materials availability, strikes and other labor issues, changes in regulations affecting development and construction, and other constraints not within the control of Titan.  Within twelve months following issuance of the final Certificate of Occupancy all improvements shall be completed and all construction equipment and trailers shall be removed.    Karen S.

If I deciphered this correctly, this is going to  be what I would call an ""autoborrow"" facility ... Enovate's cash flow is  swept into an account.  Each day:  (i) if Enovate's cash position is short  (and availability remains under the loan agreements) advances are made under  each loan agreement (probably directly into the acount), and (ii) if  Enovate's position is long, the positive balance of the account is applied  towards the outstanding loan balances, if any.  We'll need to get minimum  target amounts (i.e., do you really want them paying down $1.00 of each  loan?) from the business people.  Based on the foregoing, I suspect that these will be single-lender, prime  rate based loan agreements (otherwise it would be a huge operational  headache).  Once you confirm the single lender part, that will be enough  preliminary information for me to start on a loan agreement.","I am working with outside counsel to get a draft of the revolver prepared.

Allyson and company  did a fantastic job preparing.  Witness Keenan performed as expected.   Neither intervener (NCNG nor the Attorney General's Office) had any  questions.  Giselle Rankin asked if we would commit to establishing site  control via a lease, or similiar, prior to transferring the option.  Witness  Keenan answered in the affirmative.  She had no further questions.  The  commissioners had two questions--1) where will you connect to VEPCO's system?   2) Is this a real deal?  Everyone is behind the project and getting excited  as the external hurdles steadily disappear.  All in all, things could not have gone much better.  It was agreed at the  hearing that Allyson and Giselle would file the order jointly on October 11.   Allyson will prepare a draft of the order and deliver to us Friday.  She,  Giselle and Tom Chapman are working on the ""for any reason"" language.  They  had not discussed the language you submitted last week.  Your language is  where they will start.    Allyson feels that we have such strong support from the Commissioners that we  could fight the staff on the language (i.e. agree to disagree and let the  Commissioners decide).  Stay tuned for more action on this very hot topic.....  When you get a few minutes, I would like to disucss the county's rezoning  application and the Appian professional services agreement.

We are negotiating w/ WestLB to extend our facility until  Dec. 31, 2000.  1.C. - The ESA Option Consideration does not read like an ""option payment""  nor do the amounts look like option premiums.  This section needs to be  vetted with ENA and ESA transaction support to insure that there are no  problems.  Our normal option requirements with vendors may not be required  here since internal and all assets already off balance sheet.  1.C. - As the WestLB facility is currently drafted, ESA would have to provide  us their ""purchase option election"" by tomorrow, Oct. 12th.  I am having that  extended in the current Nov. 12 maturity deal until 5 - 10 days before Nov  12th.  WestLb has not agreed to this yet.  The purchase date can be 5 days  after we provide notice of purchase under the WestLB facility, but no later  than Nov.12 currently.  In any case, ESA must give ENA notice no later than  our required notice date and doesn't have to, at this point, provide money  and purchase the equipment 5 days thereafter.  Just explaining the deal so  you know what leeway there is for negotiating the purchase date.  1.D. - Conflicts with language in 7.  I thought the arrangement was that as  soon as ESA purchased the equipment from ENA, new purchase contracts drafted  to take ENA out of the agent loop for those assets.  In ESA's deal, they will  be the Agent of the equipment on behalf  of the SPV/Owner.  2.A & B. - The GE Change Order and ABB Change Order as defined don't describe  the actual turbines and transformers, do they?  I thought the Change Orders  were for ancillary equipment.  3.A.2. - To clarify, add ""paid to ABB"" after ""option premiums"".  3.B.3. - Insert a ""."" at end of section.  4. - Delete.  This is not an option for ESA any longer.  7. - See 1.D. above.

Kay,  To briefly answer your questions, we are contemplating another layer of  documents with the EPC contract.  There will also be a Development Agreement  that outlines our development activities and our nonrefundable fee.  I don't  read his comments to mean he only wants one EPC contract.  Let's discuss  tomorrow.  Also, we've told Bob Wright that if the plants don't work, the  state gets its money back.  I think he and everyone involved would be  amenable to a performance band provided that a comparable reduction in price  accompanies the reduced performance (to the 10 percent floor, of course).   This LOI outlines the EPC contracts only.  The Development Agreement will  cover our fee.  So, no, our fee is not at risk for the fuel cells failing to  perform.

I know  this may depend on whether CRRA or someone else is doing the balance of the  construction activities.  2.  He expects one EPC contract, and we had tried to leave room for multiple  contracts. Does anyone care?  3.  Does CRRA get a full refund of the purchase price if the fuel cells fail  the performance tests?  We have discussed with FCE the concept of a  proportional reduction if the performance is within 10 percent, then a full  reduction as to the failing unit(s) only.

2022-04-14 12:35:25+00:00,true,3,"  Attached is my red-line of Chris' redline.  I want to make sure we try to  define what they are going to do for $50,000 and that they let us know early  if it looks like the costs are going to be higher (I think optioning  premiums, survey, and landman should cost more like $100,000).    Another key facet of this deal is that we need the right to force assignment  of the easement options so we can either build the line to NGPL ourselves, or  to Nicor only (assuming they'll go for this).  If not, we may want to secure  the easements to the Nicor point ourselves so we have dual-pipe flexibility.  Finally, we need to make sure they talk to us before approaching any of the  landowners directly adjacent to our property so we can tell our nearby  neighbors that they're coming in advance, and so we can let NGPL know who to  talk to - and more importantly - who not to talk to.  I did not include this  last point in my mark-up.  The idea here is to fullfill the representations made to our potential site  buyer that we would secure easements for a gas pipeline.  Since the buyer has  a large gas marketing affiliate, they may balk at a Nicor-only gas supply  option (as did Julie Gomez).  Therefore, we feel its prudent to have a dual  pipe option so we can argue that this is a site value enhancment and that  NGPL constitutes a highly liquid supply source with pricing that would more  than amortize the incremental capital cost associated with the added 6 miles  of pipeline (approximately $4 million).  Scott has indicated that he wants us  to secure easement options for a gas line and that the buyer is willing to  pay for 50% of those costs as part of the site purchase.  Prior to signing  this authorization, we will have gotten Nicor's proposal for a 3 mile line so  we can weigh the alternatives.  Chris has already initiated contact with  Nicor (their first offer over the phone was scary).              Enron North America Corp.

Sheila Tweed advised me you were the proper  person to be looking at this matter for governmental affairs. I went ahead  and yesterday did a markup of the requested conflicts waiver from Murtha  Cullina to keep the ball moving and distributed that markkup internally via  the attachment, but nothing more has happened since then. The revised waiver  letter appended to the attachment is marked to show changes to the original  Murtha request, so I won't forward that document to you unless you want it.

Candidly, I  don't see how Murtha can continue to represent us in lobbying for the subject  transactions and represent CRRA in lobbying and legal representation for the  same transactions without conflicts or creating the appearance of  impropriety, and the markup reflects that scepticism by trying to segregate  out the representation cleanly. Also, to the extent the original draft  indicated Murtha had represented both CRRA and Enron re the transactions  until now, we need to make sure that we are OK with waiving that conflict as  a substantive matter. I'm not familiar enough with the representation to know  if Enron's interests could have been compromised during that period of dual  representation, and I do not think we should agree to the waiver until we are  comfortable on that score.The letter also now  makes clear that Murtha will  not be able to represent either party or their affiliates in litigation  involving them. Since the letter requires the signature of Enron Corp., I'm  trying to find out what clearance is required, as I customarily do not review  or initial Corp. documents for signature.

2022-04-14 08:10:14+00:00,true,3,"  Kay:  This is the last Illinois ENA project that is currently ""active.""  We have been informed that the Lake Calumet/Peoples Energy project is on hold indefinitely, pending acquisition of turbines by Peoples.  From a legal perspective, the Great Plains Energy Center/Konicek/Kendall County matter likewise is on hold, pending commercial resolution of transmission constraint issues with Commonwealth Edison Company.  However, as soon as the transmission issues are resolved, this project could move fairly quickly.  If and when ENA decides to move forward with this matter, we envision that PMRW would provide legal counsel in the following areas:  1.  Close on the Konicek property.  ENA has on option on this property that expires December 15, 2001.  Depending upon various commercial and operational issues, PMRW may also be asked to assist with closing on additional properties surrounding Konicek property.  2.  Pursuant to the terms of the Annexation Agreement, annexation of the property to the City of Yorkville may occur when (a) ENA closes on the Konicek property; (b) the property is contiguous to the City; and (c) either (i) the County issues the final Certificate of Occupancy for the facility; or (ii) the Annexation Waiver Notice is delivered by ENA's development subsidiary to the City. The property currently is not contiguous to the City border.   3.  Secure necessary environmental permits and approvals for pipelines, air emissions, water usage and water discharge.  4.   Provide legal counsel associated with negotiating and implementing roadway and maintenance agreements.  If ENA does not annex to the City of Yorkville and instead develops in the County, prior to issuance of the building permits, ENA will be required to finalize the terms of the Roadway Construction and Maintenance Agreements with Bristol Township.  If the property is annexed to the City of Yorkville, ENA still has an obligation per the terms of the annexation agreement to repair/replace the damage resulting from construction of the facility.  Typically, PMRW also provides legal counsel as needed during construction for implementing the terms of the Roadway Agreements.  5.   Provide required legal assistance regarding construction activities.  Typically, this involves securing building permits, certificates of occupancy, etc.  6.  Per the terms of the Annexation Agreement, when at least 200 acres of area around the property is developed with industrial or commercial use, the City can create a special assessment district for roadway improvements along Corneils Road.  Per Section 2(A)(E), the developer at that point is responsible for 10% or the cost of the roadways improvements or $300,000 whichever is less for all roadway assessments in the aggregate.  PMRW would assist with all legal issues arising from the creation of the special assessment district and payments in to the fund.  7.  Provide post-construction legal assistance to negotiate and secure the corporate guaranties for outstanding improvements.  8. Provide legal assistance securing the pipeline route and the accompanying easements.  9. Provide legal assistance in negotiation of a potential Assessment Agreement with the County and Township Assessors. Additionally, if the project is developed under the County's rules, it will be necessary to negotiate a similar agreement with the County Board of Assessment Review.  Even if developed under the City's rules, it may be desirable to negotiate such an agreement with the County Board of Assessment Review.  There also has been some internal discussion at ENA suggesting that this property might be sold.  If ENA chooses such a strategy, PMRW would provide the legal support for the due diligence activities associated with the sale.

If I deciphered this correctly, this is going to  be what I would call an ""autoborrow"" facility ... Enovate's cash flow is  swept into an account.  Each day:  (i) if Enovate's cash position is short  (and availability remains under the loan agreements) advances are made under  each loan agreement (probably directly into the acount), and (ii) if  Enovate's position is long, the positive balance of the account is applied  towards the outstanding loan balances, if any.  We'll need to get minimum  target amounts (i.e., do you really want them paying down $1.00 of each  loan?) from the business people.  Based on the foregoing, I suspect that these will be single-lender, prime  rate based loan agreements (otherwise it would be a huge operational  headache).  Once you confirm the single lender part, that will be enough  preliminary information for me to start on a loan agreement.

2022-04-14 22:54:00+00:00,true,3,"  Hi guys,  In looking at CRRA's comments to the draft LOI. I have these questions:  1.  I'm not sure what we mean by EPC contract.  Is this referring to the Fuel  Cell document we are working now, or is there to be another layer? I know  this may depend on whether CRRA or someone else is doing the balance of the  construction activities.  2.  He expects one EPC contract, and we had tried to leave room for multiple  contracts. Does anyone care?  3.  Does CRRA get a full refund of the purchase price if the fuel cells fail  the performance tests?  We have discussed with FCE the concept of a  proportional reduction if the performance is within 10 percent, then a full  reduction as to the failing unit(s) only.  Also, are we planning to mark up  the fuel cell contract to recover our fee?  Is our fee at risk for the fuel  cells failing to perform?

2022-04-14 07:35:13+00:00,true,3,"  Hello everyone.  More fun issues from Chicago.  I would like to discuss the  different options available for giving parent guarantees to third parties.   As everyone knows, to date we have had two third party transactions requiring  parent guarantees.  In the Trunkline transaction, each parent issued separate  guarantees for 1/2 of the requested amount, negotiated by respective  counsel.  In the Alliance transaction, Enron issued a guarantee for the  entire amount and Peoples has presented us with a reimbursement agreement  which we are reviewing.  Peoples' Board meets next Wednesday, Oct. 4, to  approve the risk management policy.  Assuming the policy is approved, deal  flow should begin to increase and I would like to discuss how these  guarantees can best be handled going forward.  My thought was an hour or so  next Monday, Oct. 2, to the extent everyone is available, with a follow up  meeting with Peoples perhaps Wednesday.  Let me know how your calendar looks  and I will coordinate the meeting.  Jeff & Kay:  Although this has been initially focused on parent guarantees,  this is part of a larger issue regarding negotiations of enovate contracts in  general.  For instance, we have agreed to templates for a Master Purchase and  Sale Agreement and a GISB Agreement.  However, who is authorized to make  changes and negotiate on behalf of enovate?  We can discuss any suggestions  for handling these situations as well.  Thanks,  Gregg","Hello everyone. More fun issues from Chicago.

I played in a tournament with some people at work out at the  Reserve last week.  Boy is that a great course.  Our tee time was at 7:30 and  we had all been out partying until 2am the night before.  So needless to say  we weren't feeling so great come tee time. However the beers were free for  the tournament and come about 7:45 we were drinking again and feeling a  little better.  We all played really well and got fourth plance out of 42  teams.  We won these sweater vests, a sand wedge, and a Nike bag.  There was  a free bar-b-que afterward with more free beer.  So by about 2pm we were all  totally schmatered.  It was a good time and I was playing with the guy that i  want to work for in Real Time Trading.  He and I are going to lunch next week  to discuss but he mentioned to me during golf that he wants me to work for  him which would be a great opportunity so things are going a little better at  work.

2022-04-14 13:46:26+00:00,false,5,"  Did you know a $96 donation provides two school-age youth access to programs  that foster resiliency by developing caring relationships, demanding high  expectations, and providing opportunities to participate in family, school,  and civic life?  The United Way-funded Youth Development Program at the Boys  & Girls Clubs of Portland Metropolitan Area promotes positive values, useful  skills and self-esteem.  It is one of many United Way-funded programs that  help youth achieve success.  Visitors to the Boys & Girls Club in Hillsboro fell youthful energy in the  air the moment they step through the front door.  Children ages 6 to 12 flock  to the club each morning during the summer to shoot pool, play air hockey,  practice kickball and much more.  Youths ages 12 to 18 serve as junior staff  members, lending a hand to regular staff and retreating to the center's teen  room when they need a break to chat with their peers.  Club Director Darrin  Marks explains that the club hosts about 100 students everyday during the  school year and 200 students daily in the summer.  The club has operated in  Hillsboro since 1992 and offers a wide variety of programs for kids.  Summer  sports activities include flag football, soccer, floor hockey, basketball and  baseball.  Other features at the club include an arts and crafts room, a  newspaper club, a science club, dance classes, and a Discovery Room with  several computers donated by Intel.  For a nominal fee, the club provides a  healthy lunch, a safe place to have fun and exposure to interesting sites in  the metropolitan area that youth might not see otherwise.  The Hillsboro club  is just one of eight sites sponsored by the Boys &  Girls Clubs of Portland  Metropolitan Area.

2022-04-14 11:52:01+00:00,false,5,"  Well, sorry to hear your weekend sucked so bad.  Mine was pretty awesome.  I  was actually very sick but ended up going out and doing stuff anyway since  Burns was in town I just didn't drink.  On Friday night a bunch of us met up  with Burns at Silver Dollar Pizza.  We hung out there for a while and then  went to the Gypsy.  I came home rather early since I wasn't drinking and  didn't want to stay in the smokey Gypsy when i was sick.  Then on Saturday  Valarie, Boyd and I drove down to the Beavers game. We had the best time.  We  went to the peacock first and the  tailgated before the game.  Burnsy, Sul,  Shef, Chris and Jimmy were so retarded by gametime.  I felt like a big  babysitter being the only sober one.  The game was awesome and everyone but  me valarie and boyd stayed down in Corvallis.  Sunday I was still feeling  sick but went to breakfast and shopping with Cheryl and then we justed vegged  at her house, watched some football, then went to the movies.  For being sick  and not touching a drop of alcohol all weekend I remarkebly had a great  time.  I still don't feel very well and had to go to the doctor yesterday  becuase I started having some bad asthma.  T  Everything else is going okay I  guess.  I have my final interview for that position I want on Thursday and  then on Friday I leave for LA .  So anyway, hope your week is going a little  better than your weekend went. Doesn't sound like you had much fun.  Were you  and Dave in a fight because he flaked on you or was it something else? ","Well, sorry to hear your weekend was sucked so bad. Mine was pretty awesome.

2022-04-14 00:43:25+00:00,true,5,"  Mike - I think we are doing a good job of isolating ourselves from the direct  risk of owning synfuel machines.  The equity owners are the ones at risk for  any amendments to Section 29 of the tax code.  Further, we have identified  the ""Class A"" machines in the market, those with the strongest PLR 's, legal  facts, and credit worthy owners, and have concentrated our activities on only  those machines.    We will be responsible for supplying coal to the machines, a short position  we enjoy today with our term sales of equity coal to Florida Powers' synfuel  group and traded coal to Sempra, and act as sales agent (obviously with  obligations to sell) for the resultant synfuel. The deals we are currently  negotiating with AIG and PacifiCorp are even more favorable then our Sempra  deal in that we will not be acting as operator of the machines.  We also  expect to receive mark to market  accounting treatment on the new deals.  As  point of reference we think AIG will be worth about $25 mm and PacifiCorp  north of $50 mm.  Although we have yet to mtm the Sempra deal, it is worth  about $25 mm on a mtm basis.   Between the above three deals we have over $100 mm of potential income this  year.  In addition we will enter into long term short positions with the  machines, which will allow us to expand our physical flows, and continue to  grow our business.  As an example, this year we will deliver about 12 - 15 mm  tons of eastern coal.  If we successfully conclude the AIG and PacifiCorp  deals, we will move an additional 11 - 13 mm tpy of eastern coal.  Sempra  will add another 2 mm tpy, for a total of 13 - 15 mm tpy.  We will be in a  position to virtually double our physical flows of eastern coal next year.  Synfuel has already had a significant impact on a number of regional markets.  Not only do we want to be in the synfuel business, we need to be in the  business in order to understand, anticipate, and take advantage of rapidly  changing market dynamics.  Synfuel represents a significant, fundamental  change in the coal business.  This changing market  will present new  opportunities for us to develop and exploit.  The key obviously is to be a  major player in both the synfuel and underlying coal markets in order to take  advantage of the information flows generated by each market.   We are already in the process of meeting with international customers about  supplying them with synfuel.  We have received a favorable reaction from both  the international utilities and steel mills.  We will gain a significant  competitive advantage in the international market by being in a position to  offer synfuel not only through Pier IX in Virginia (Sempra), but also through  New Orleans (AIG and PacifiCorp - via terminal sites on the Ohio River  system).  We have asked our regulatory people to stay on top of any activity in  Washington, and to date synfuel has not been a significant political issue.   Jordan has directed our outside tax people to monitor the IRS' temperature,   and their response to any letters they receive regarding synfuel from members  of Congress or the industry. The noise in the system has been primarily  generated by Arch Coal Co. who are not active in the synfuel market; and the  State of West Virginia, who would like to tax the production of synfuel.   The tax issue is one we will try to solve by pushing back on the equity.   Arch is no match for the combined legal and lobbying capabilities of the  large players now in the synfuel business - Florida Power, SCANA, PGE, AIG,  Sempra, PacifiCorp, Kentucky Utilities, TECO, Keystone Conemaugh, DQE,  Norfolk Southern, Fannie Mae, Drummond, Peabody (Lehman Bros.), Alliance  (Chase), Massey (Fluor) and Southern Company Services. In addition Aquila.  PSE&G, Duke, CP&L, VEPCO, Santee Cooper and others are working to locate  machines at their river terminal and generation sites.  I will be in Pittsburgh and West Virginia all of next week.  I would like to  schedule a meeting time for the group, and I will call in - preferably Monday  mid - afternoon or Tuesday late afternoon.  Angie will coordinate with  everyone to set a convenient time.  Thanks,  George            From:  Mike McConnell                           09/15/2000 04:18 PM    To: George McClellan/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Synfuel  George,  I would like to have a brief (30 minute) meeting about the noise in the  political system about synfuel and reaffirm Jordon's viewpoint on Section 29  credits.  This is big issue and without this reaffirmation I believe we will  have approval issues with RAC and others.  I want Jeff and/or I in the  meeting.

2022-04-14 15:33:31+00:00,false,5,"  Gary,  There were two such events.  On the Scott McNelly side, I realized that we  weren't too late to change our approach and take a commercial view on  technology.  None of the other companies were thinking our new way at all  plus when someone of the caliber and reputation of McNelly gives you a  general approval and confirmation, as a new guy, that meant a lot.  It  inspired me to keep going on a ""nontraditional"" path.  The other big  impact  moment was listening and having a brief conversation with John Chambers of  Cisco.  It was at the eCommerce Summit in Washington DC and he gave his, ""its  a matter of survival"" speech.  That really hit me and our conversation was  also similar about my new job and Enron's new approach.  He gave me a  positive response and also gave me some advice that included an observation  that the incumbent IT people may not have the abilities to help me lead Enron  in the eCommerce world.  It was going to take a different kind of  technologist.  That moment had the most impact on me of the two.   I saw John  again and spoke with him at an Economist  conference in Laguna Nigel and told  him of his original impact and I think he appreciated the story.  He also was  very nice to give me some time to talk after that speech as well.  I hope that clarified things,  good luck with the piece.

2022-04-14 03:59:09+00:00,true,5,"  Jeff, as we talked earlier we need to get what you want ASAP because in these  energy markets , which I think we both agree are not going to settle down any  time soon, coupled with the growth you and Mike want to see we are operating  under ridiculously small limits. 8 million VAR for a group our size , with  our turnover and number of traders just doesn't work. We have 15 to 20  million of structured deals, primarlily coming from Don S that at this time  we would have to walk away from. We can not go out and recruit more and  better traders to have them sit at their desk and not trade do to limits  which in no way are reflective of the size and risk Enron should be willing  to take if they truly have bought into this being a significant global  business. I  suggest they should have raised them already as a reflection of  where they want to take the business and thought this through prior to the  move  to Global Markets.

The application is to changeout the existing vaporizers at the  terminal and to install blending facilities to deal with higher heat value  LNG coming in to the terminal.  Our intervention gave general support to the filing but reserved the right to  comment at a later time after further analysis of the impact of introducing  high heat value LNG into the downstream pipelines had been completed.  The intervention has been fully reviewed by Shelley Corman and we believe, as  a result, the tone of the document is not adversarial.  Further to this, we  discussed the intervention with SLNG's FERC staff, and after incorporating a  few minor changes they requested, confirmed with them that they had no strong  objections to the filing.

When Jim Roundtree and I visisted the head of security at the  US embassy, he warned that an evacuation of Gaza by the US embassy is very  unlikely under any circumstances because of the difficulty of coordinating  such an excercise with the US military, and the ""political message"" it would  send.

Imagine this -  as of today, Austin has taken more than 16,425 shots and more than 27,300  finger sticks.  It never gets easier for him and it will never go away until  a cure is found.   Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, adult  blindness and non-traumatic amputations, a leading cause of nerve damage,  heart attack and stroke.  Until a cure is found, his health is better today  than it will be tomorrow.   Please let me know if I can count on you to walk with me or help raise funds  for Juvenile Diabetes.  84% of the money raised goes directly to diabetes  research.   My commitment to you is this - walk with me - I guarantee you a  morning of fun, good times and the opportunity to meet a large, dynamic group  of people committed to finding a cure.  Sponsor me - you will help millions  of kids like mine that are desperately looking for a cure.    The walk is on Sunday, November 5, 9:00 AM - 4.5 miles at Sam Houston Race  Park.   If you cannot join in the walk but want to help monetarily, please  send your check payable to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) to my  attention - 1400 Smith Street, EB 760 / Houston, Tx  77002.

2022-04-14 06:19:00+00:00,false,5,"  I have discussed this with McConnell, who has advised that Skilling will  probably not approve this deal if it requires Enron equity to appraise  reserves and if Sherrick is not willing to put equity in.  I have asked  Sherrick to define his minimal ""bottom line"" position so that we can discuss  it with Atlantis.  Sherrick's people got overly aggressive about this and tabled directly with  Atlantis a new (and in my opinion, way over the top) proposal without my  knowledge while I was in the air late last week.  Atlantis announced Saturday that they were walking the deal because EGEP's  request is so outragious.  David Wilson, head of Atlantis,  immediately  departed Houston for the UAE.  He is here now and is peddling the deal  actively to others.  I met with David today and got him to agree to give me a couple of days to  sort this out with Sherrick.  If I can't either get Sherrick on board or get  UOG to agree to a restructuring that does not require any front-end Enron  equity, we risk losing this deal.    At the same time, we have reached agreement with UOG that they will put up  70% of the $40 million front-end reserves appraisal equity and they will pay  Enron a promote and front-end success fee that will give us a return close to  30% and them a return of 18%.  We risk losing this deal over $12 million of Enron equity to appraise  reserves (and hopefully I can push a bit more of this risk onto UOG to reduce  the number a bit more.) The deal would also give UOG and Dolphin a strong  kick-start, and UOG is anxious to get it done.  Will advise after I talk more with Sherrick, UOG and Atlantis.  This deal  will live or die this week.  I will have major problems with UOG if it dies.

He is  still ready to endorse the technical viability of the project and to provide  upstream technical services to us, but is unwilling to invest with us unless  he has the right to step in to all other Atlantis properties in the region as  majority interest holder and operator.    I have felt that EGEP's willingness to be in the project as an equity holder  would give Joe and you the assurance that this deal was solid from an  upstream perspective.  However, I plan to continue developing this 25%-30%  IRR project with only Enron Middle East (30%) and UOG(70%) as equity  contributors and simply rely on Jeff to endorse the upstream numbers and  provide upstream tech services.

First, Enron Global E & P has elected to forego  an equity role in the Atlantis project.  From a technical view, EGEP has  independently verified the structure and gas column in Sharjah/Ajman and has  an optimistic preliminary view of Umm al Qawain subject to 3-D confirmation.  EGEP believes that the Atlantis concesions in the UAE offer significant  upside potential outside of the Sharjah /Ajman and Umm al Qawain Production  Areas.  It is EGEP's view that Atlantis's greatest expected value is through  NEWCO, and on the strength of NEWCO's (Enron's) leverage in the negotiation,   it should not be unreasonable for NEWCO to expect Atlantis to concede express  farmin rights to Enron to develop and produce new reserves in Atlantis's  concessions.  Jeff and team are dissappointed that Atlantis has rejected the  concept, especially since David Wilson appeared to have reacted favorably to  the idea when Jeff layed it out at the London meeting in July.   EGEP  believes that the NPV to NEWCO does not provide a sufficient hedge against  potential slippage due to factors such as price uncertainty, precessing  tarif, capex, gas GHV, etc, risks which could be mitigated and managed  through Enron(EGEP) majority ownership of the upside, i.e. earned by farmin  to the concession blocks.  EGEP has ranked Atlantis against its other  upstream opportunities based on the current deal and Jeff has decided to  conserve his limited equity for other investments.  This decision is  independent of EGEP's commitment to support Enron upstream investments with  or without equity and EGEP is continuing to develop the Technical Service  Agreements with Atlantis and NEWCO to fulfill this responsibility.

2022-04-14 15:25:32+00:00,true,5,"  Gary,  Thanks for the email.  Here is my attempt to type out a response.  I hope it  helps.  1.  It was a matrix organization.  The IT personnel reported into the Global  Tech. group but we did that for communication and consistency  purposes  rather than simply control.  They attended business unit staff meetings and  the BU had a great influence in the review process and gave constant  feedback.  It was vitally important for the ""customer"" to be happy and that  the IT person completed the projects from the BU.  When it came to the review  process itself, GT ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit  had the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated.  2.  When Enron Net Works was formed, nothing really changed on the day to day  working of the IT world.  IT (Global Technology) was folded into the newly  created 5th business unit at Enron.  Remember Global Technology had more that  IT alone.  We had an eCommerce commercial group, a principal investments  group and was developing eCommerce or Technology origination roles developing  around the world.  Philippe Bibi is the CTO for Enron and Enron Net Works.  He is in the office  of the chairman of ENW with Greg Whalley, CEO and Louise Kitchen, the newly  appointed COO.  Both LK and GW are non IT people.  There are many VPs on the  next level that are IT executives.  3.  In a nut shell, Scott grinned when I told him of my 2 weeks experience  and title as CEO with Enron's goal of becoming the largest B2B player in the  world.  He chuckled and said something like, ""That sounds like Enron, it  always looks at things differently.  He then stated that my CEO title and  Enron's approach was very unusual but that it would be more common place  soon,  as this was the way of the future and Enron was the first to recognize  it and change its culture"".  4.  When i used the word cannibalize, I meant that if we didn't change the  business ourselves, than our competition would do this for us.  For example,  we were the leading trader of natural gas in the US by far but we initiated  EnronOnline and completely changed the way we traded natural gas and did it  for free.  Thus we cannibalized our own successful business even when it was  going great.  We are looking at all of our businesses for changes like that.  Gary, I hoped that helped.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have  any other questions.

They are good background. And thanks so much for meeting with Julia and me this week. It was most  interesting and helpful. I'm confused on a couple of points, so would you mind answering a few more questions?  1. You said that after Enron created the Global Technology group, you ""seeded people out into the business units, and the way we did that is we had those people be totally accountable both to us and to the business unit head."" So,  at that point it was a sort of matrix organization, with IT people dispersed thoughout the business units but at the same time accountable to a central IT organization for things such as standards, is that correct?  2. Then, this spring when Net Works was formed, did those 1,500 IT people essentially leave the business units to join a more traditional IT  organization? Roughly how many non-IT people, and of what types, are part of Net Works? Two  of the three top managers in Net Works are non-IT (from trading), correct? Does  any given IT person now still live in a matrix world with responsibilities to IT  and to a business unit?  3. For some reason, my recorder messed up and I couldn't decipher what you  said about Scott McNealy's reaction to your background, etc. at the breakfast.  Could you repeat that?  4. You said: ""We had to cannibalize our own businesses. So what I think you'll see five years from now is that the IT world will look totally different.""  What did you mean by ""cannibalize our own business""?.  Thanks again.  Regards, Gary Anthes  Gary H.

I do not intend to circulate outside HR other than  to then 7 of you, Cindy O and the other HR leads. This essentially reflects  what I hope you already know that your HR lead support is:  ENA - Me with Sheila Knudsen (I ultimately hope Cindy Skinner will move to  take this lead sometime next year). EGM - Cindy Skinner and Shanna Funkhouser (We believe Shanna will develop to  lead this in the next 12 months) EIM - Me and Fran Mayes (the plan would be for Fran to eventually take lead  on this when she is ready).   Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  David  ****************************************************************************** *************************************************************************  TO: ALL ENA HR CC: Olson, Delainey, Lavorato, Frevert, McMahon, Bowen, McConnell, Shankman,  R. Jones, M.Barnard, M.Joyce, D.Lynch, B.VanCleve From: Oxley  Western Hemisphere Wholesale Energy HR Group Organisation Change  When we launched our HR Franchise Team structure in February this year we did  so with the commitment to continually refine and challenge ourselves to  ensure we were optimising the resources we have available to help our  businesses achieve and exceed their goals. In fact you will recall in  communicating the changes in February, we actually highlighted what we  anticipated would be a need to make further refinements and changes to  maximise our effectiveness.  A great deal has happened in these last 6 months and I am delighted that the  Franchise team concept has contributed so much towards our far greater  partnership with our individual business groups and our own outlook,  priorities and objectives. We truly have revolutionised how we provide HR  services and advice. More importantly, the business has recognised us for the  huge progress we have made to date. This success is an outstanding  achievement and one that I hope you join me in being extremely proud of.  As is always the case at Enron, continuous change is the norm and so as to  illustrate this point quite effectively the businesses previously part of ENA  have over the last 2 months, essentially been split into three: Enron Global  Markets, set up to focus on the Global Fuels markets which were previously  part of Enron Europe and CALME,  Coal, Financial Tarding and  Insurance/Weather which were all previously part of ENA. EGM is now led by  Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman. Enron Industrial Markets, set up to focus  on the Industrial markets and expand our activities across new Industrial  sectors which will build on the success of the Paper, Pulp and Lumber  business previously part of ENA and immediately develop a steel market. EIM  is led by Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen. Enron North America remains the largest  of these three businesses even after these changes and will now focus all of  its efforts on the highly successful Gas and Power markets in North America,  including Canada and Mexico. ENA continues to be led by Dave Delainey and  John Lavorato. Mark Frevert, following his return from Europe, has been  instrumental in the restructuring of these businesses and is Chairman of each  of these as well as Enron Europe, which collectively now constitute Enron's  entire activities in the Wholesale commodity markets.  These changes in the businesses we support clearly force us to re-examine the  HR business model and adjust our strategy accordingly. Fortunately, our  flexible organisation structure lends itself extremely well to realign along  these new business lines and as such the changes illustrated below in the  attached org chart are far easier for us to make than they might otherwise  have been. In addition, given the immense value and positive client feedback  we have received on our efforts to concentrate our HR resources on Franchise  skill lines, this also provides us with an opportunity to reinforce and  refine our efforts in developing market intelligence, employment  propositions, compensation ideas and best practices, as well as the  innovatively sourced talent pipelines in each of these areas to pro-actively  provide our clients with a competitive advantage.  I believe the changes outlined on the attached org chart are self  explanatory, however if you have any questions please feel free to raise them  either with your team leads or me. Given that we have a staff meeting  scheduled for Friday I would plan to walk through these changes with you and  answer any questions at that time.  Finally, to reinforce our goals and prepare you all for the next 6 months, I  would like to underline the overall commitment to continue to change and flex  our resources to anticipate, meet and exceed our businesses needs. This will  clearly mean further organisation changes as we move forward. This is not  Change for change's sake, but change, and our ability to change quickly and  as often as necessary, is essential for us to remain a competitive and  effective HR resource for our clients.

I was off  Monday & Tuesday and had four doctors appointments so that was fun.  I  finally got my bookcases cleaned (there were spider webs all over them) and  my Halloween decorations that Mom made me up.  My house looks really nice (to  nice for us actually).

2022-04-14 01:59:58+00:00,false,6,"  Jerry Scarbrough's True Orange The Internet Newsletter For The True Texas Longhorn Faithful  Volume 10, No. 23, September 18, 2000  Late, Great Rally Comes Up Short at Stanford; Texas Falls From No. 5 to No. 15 After Loss  The Longhorns couldn't run, couldn't protect the quarterback, got a punt blocked for a Stanford touchdown, and still almost won the game against the defending Pac 10 champion Cardinals. But they didn't. Stanford won a 27-24 verdict with a late touchdown that negated a 15-point fourth-quarter Texas rally. Coach Mack Brown praised the Longhorns' fight, and they did fight, and he said the team can build on the loss because it showed the young players the= y have a chance to win tough games on the road. ""We tried,"" he said. ""This one was tough because of the mistakes we made. W= e came back and had a chance to win it with those two big fourth quarter drives. We just came up a little short."" Brown said the team has to work hard to improve. He didn't single out the offensive line as a unit that needs to improve, but, while the receivers dropped some ball, the quarterbacks missed some open receivers and the defense bent more than it should, the one constant negative this year has been an inability to run the football. After playing two teams who are not very good at stopping the run, the Longhorns are last in the Big 12 and No. 112 of 114 Division I football tea= ms in average rushing yardage per game at 50. In two games, they have 100 net rushing yards. The Longhorns actually ran the ball better against Stanford than they did against a weak Louisiana-Lafayette team in their opening 52-10 win, but the Cardinal defenders had five sacks to cut into the net figure. I have been predicting a very good season, and Brown has been saying the te= am has some problems and must get better to accomplish its goals. He's right a= nd I'm wrong. Let's just hope he and his assistant coaches can work out the problems in the offense in time to let the team accomplish its goals. The victory gave Stanford, a 14-point underdog, a 2-1 record, while the Longhorns fell to 1-1. Here, briefly, is how the game went: FIRST QUARTER Stanford won the toss and took the ball. After an exchange of punts, Stanfo= rd drove to midfield, but backup DE Maurice Gordon sacked QB Randy Fasani and Fasani suffered an injured ankle and had to leave the game. He was replaced by sophomore Chris Lewis. A face-mask penalty on a bad Stanford punt negate= d that punt and gave Stanford a first down at the 47 and the Cardinal took advantage of that Longhorn miscue, scoring in four plays with Lewis hitting WR Luke Powell behind Quentin Jammer for the final 37 yards to put Stanford ahead, 6-0, with 6:06 left in the quarter. DE Cory Redding blocked the extr= a point. Ivan Williams ran the kickoff back to the 22. Texas drove to the Stanford 43 before stalling. Kris Stockton got off a great punt that kicked out of bounds at the Stanford 2. A fumbled snap pushed Stanford inside the = 2, then Redding and DT Casey Hampton led a surge that trapped FB Casey Moore i= n the end zone for a safety with 1:14 left, leaving Stanford on top, 6-2. Chr= is Simms came in at QB for Texas and the Horns were at midfield as the period ended. SECOND QUARTER Simms hit freshman WR Roy Williams down the middle for a 37-yard touchdown strike on the third play of the quarter. Williams broke an attempted tackle by CB Ryan Fernandez at the 21 and strolled in for the score. Stockton's ki= ck put Texas on top, 9-6, with 13:59 left. Applewhite relieved Simms midway through the period. Neither team threatened again until Stanford drove 67 yards, primarily on two big pass plays, to take a 13-9 left with 4:49 left. Neither team threatened again before intermission. THIRD QUARTER Texas got the ball first, but failed to make a first down and had to punt. = A horde of Stanford defenders poured through and blocked it and backup FB Emo= ry Brock covered it in the end zone for a touchdown, putting Stanford up, 20-9= , just one minute deep into the second half. The rest of the quarter was a defensive struggle, with each team making only one first down. FOURTH QUARTER Applewhite hit WR Montrell Flowers for 19 yards on the second play of the fourth quarter to revive the long dormant UT offense and get the Horns started on a drive that enabled them to get into Stanford territory for the first time in the second half, but a holding penalty and then a sack pushed the Horns back and killed the drive. With 9:39 left and Longhorn fans everywhere beginning to despair, Texas, starting from its own 29, got back = in the game on one huge play. Applewhite found freshman WR B. J. Johnson behin= d all the defenders and hit him for a 71-yard scoring strike. The Horns decid= ed to go for a 2-point conversion and, after a pass interference penaty put th= e ball on the 1, Mitchell went over the top to get the two-pointer and cut th= e Stanford lead to 20-17 with 9:29 left. The Texas defense, again forced Stanford to punt quickly. Mitchell returned the punt to the Texas 41. Applewhite hit TE Mike Jones for 25 yards to the Stanford 34, but, under a big blitz, he was intercepted at the Stanford 4 with 7:46 left. Stanford punted with 6:42 left, and Mitchell made a great punt return, dashing 48 yards to the Cardinal 18, but a holding penalty on the return pushed the Horns back to the 38. Backup TB Victor Ike was stopped for no gain and Applewhite threw an incomplete pass and to bring up third-and-10. Ike raced down the left sideline and caught Applewhite's long throw just behind a Stanford defender and sprinted in for the TD, putting Texas ahead, 24-20, with 5:44 left. Stanford got a good kickoff return to the Cardinal 46, but couldn't move and had to punt, giving Texas a chance to run the clock out with 5:44 left. A couple of first downs would have done it, but two false-start penalties left the Horns in a hole. They made 19 yards in three plays, but faced a fourth-and-1 at their own 29 and had to punt. Stanford, held in check throughout the second half by the Longhorn defense, started i= ts drive with 1:55 left. The Cardinal scored in five plays, with Lewis hitting WR DeRonnie Phipps for 30 yards to the Texas 29. The Longhorns were called for roughing the passer and a penalty to the 15 was tacked on. After an incompletion, Lewis found Pitts again and he barreled over for the winning = TD with 1:12 left. Texas had enough time to come back, but the Stanford defens= e, which already had three sacks, got two more in that final minute to finish off the Longhorns. Notes . . * The Longhorns haven't rushed for 100 net yards in their last five games. They are 1-4 in those games, with the lone victory being the season opener against Louisiana-Lafayette. * The Texas' defense allowed Stanford only one first down in the third quarter and only two in the fourth quarter, until the Cardinal's winning drive in the final two minutes. * Texas had 18 possessions. Three of them resulted in touchdown, two ended with pass interceptions, 12 ended with punts and the one at the end of the game ended on downs after Applewhite was sacked twice. * Texas' three touchdown plays accounted for 149 of the Longhorns 343 total net yards. It was a feast-or-famine kind of game for the UT offense, which only three other plays that gained more than 12 yards.  900 Number Updated Daily  I update my 900 number daily with football and football recruiting scoops. The number is 1-900-288-8839. It costs $1.59 a minute. You must be 18 to ca= ll.  Coach's Corner  Coach Mack Brown was tired Sunday afternoon for his weekly post-game news conference. The team plane left Palo Alto at 3 a.m. Texas time and got back to Austin around 7 a.m. But he was fairly upbeat. ""You always hate to lose,"" he said, ""but if you have to lose, you ought to lose early. If you're going to lose, it ought to be out of conference."" He said the only thing the lose really costs the Longhorns is a chance at going undefeated, ""and we're not a national championship caliber team, in m= y opinion."" He said the Horns can still accomplish a lot. ""Look at Stanford last year,"" he said. ""You never want to lose a game, but Stanford wins the Pac 10 last year after they leave here with an embarrassing loss."" Brown said nothing went the Longhorns' way in Palo Alto. ""It was a night th= at nothing worked for us, but the positive thing is that we still had a chance to win."" No one asked him about his starting quarterback because he says he has two starters, but it appears Major Applewhite is back in the saddle. He started Saturday night and was the quarterback on 14 of UT's 18 possessions. Sophomore Phil Simms got the other four possessions. He can't comment on officiating without getting in trouble with the Big 12 office, but there were a lot of penalties against the Longhorns that came a= t crucial times, like the flagrant face-mask call that negated Stanford's pun= t on a fourth-and-25 and gave the Cardinal an automatic first down en route t= o their first touchdown. The Longhorns also had two false start penalties whe= n they were trying to run out the clock with a 24-20 lead. They gained 19 yar= ds on their three plays that stood up, but that left a yard short and they had to run.Then there was a roughing-the-passer penalty on Stanford's winning drive in the final two minutes. While Brown couldn't comment after the game, he had several animated discussions with the officials during the action. Without commenting on the officiating, he said, ""They got a holding call on an incomplete pass on third down on one touchdown. The face mask penalty le= d to a score. There was a late hit call on the quarterback on their last (scoring) drive. Those things just abolutely kill because just about every one led to points for them."" Brown said the Longhorns didn't use their shotgun formation with four wideouts more because ""we weren't throwing the ball and catching it very well. That's something we would have done more if we had done better at it.= "" ""We didn't have a good night throwing the ball overall,"" he said. ""We had some drops, we had some passes that missed and we had some young receivers who were playing on the road for the first time. Montrell Flowers was the g= uy who played the best among the wide receivers, and he's the most experienced= . It was a combination of errors on our passing game. We were just not smooth= ."" Brown was asked about the team's performance in specific area that have caused problems in the past and have gotten special attention, like the offensive line and the special teams. He said, ""After looking at the tape, the offensive line played better than = we thought. The blitzes were our big problem. It looked worse than it was. I feel like we've made some progress with our offensive line. We've got to ke= ep working on that. I think the special teams have improved a lot. We had some kickoff returns and Hodges (Mitchell) had the good punt return, but we had = a blocked punt for a touchdown. We had to punt a lot, but that blocked punt really bothers me. We can't have one, no matter how many times we have to punt. That's the part they have to focus on."" He said Texas has to bounce back quickly from the long, tiring road trip, coupled with the loss. ""Our guys are totally exhausted. We got back at 7 a.m. (Sunday). That's why we didn't go to Hawaii =01) because we knew it would be a hard game and a l= ong trip."" ""Our team played really hard. This was tough because we played so hard, but had too many mistakes. But our kids fought all the way. That's what we have to build on. We've got another game Saturday."" ""Houston is not going to care about our loss,"" he said. ""It'll probably excite them. We can sit around and mope or we can get ready to play again. This was a little eye opener for us to get better and move forward."" He said players and coaches can't get as up or down as fans because they kn= ow they have to get ready to play another game and can't dwell on a win or a loss until the season is over. ""That's the least of my worries,"" he said. ""They really tried. When you really try and you can come back on the road and have a chance to win, that= 's something that's a positive to build on."" He said this game will help the team later on because it was a game the Hor= ns could have won on the road against a good team. ""We just made too many mistakes,"" he said. ""That's something we can correct= . If we had a team that didn't care, that it didn't both to lose, that's the worst thing that can happen to you as a coach, but that's not the problem."" After the game Saturday night, Brown said most of the players were so upset they were crying. ""We can build on this,"" he said. ""We have a really young football team. We'= ll come back and get better. We can correct the mistakes."" ""We took a big step in these big games by just hanging in there and hanging in there. As long as they'll fight, you can coach them, and they fought all the way. It was mistakes that cost them, not their effort, and that can be fixed. We made three or four mistakes that probably cost us the game."" Brown said the bottom line is ""we're a young team and we will get better."" INJURY UPDATE: Brown said safety Lee Jackson has a strained hamstring and linebacker Marcus Wilkins has a sore groin. He said those appeared to be th= e only injuries sustained in the Stanford game and both players are expected = to be back at practice by the middle of the week.

2022-04-14 15:28:50+00:00,true,6,"  Jerry Scarbrough's True Orange The Internet Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful  Volume 10, No. 26, October 9, 2000  No What-Iffing in This One =01) Sooners Turn Longhorns Every Which Way but Loose  The Longhorns had their worst day during the Mack Brown era Saturday in Dallas and they picked a bad time to do it because unbeaten Oklahoma scored on its first six possessions, and, for good measure, ran a pass back for a touchdown, too, en route to a 63-14 victory. The Sooners dominated the Longhorns offensively, defensively and on special teams. They even won the halftime, when a Billy Sims-led relay team beat an Eric Metcalf-led relay team. QB Josh Huepel passed the Longhorns to death and 5-7, 193-pound sophomore R= B Quentin Griffin broke Oklahoma's school scoring record =01) and Longhorn fa= ns' hearts =01) with six touchdowns. In short, it just wasn't a good day to be a Texas fan =01) in the cold, dam= p Cotton Bowl or anywhere. The loss dropped Texas to 4-2 for the season and 1-1 in the Big 12 and gave the Sooners a big boost in their drive toward national and Big 12 honors. It also made this Saturday's game with Colorado in Boulder the biggest game of the year. This is a season on the brink. It could go up or down. Remembe= r that 66-3 debacle with UCLA that started the slide in John Mackovic's last year? Brown is made of sterner stuff and I think he can get this team back on track. But he has to do it in a hurry. One thing Longhorn fans need to be very thankful about is that Heupel is a senior. He was absolutely awesome Saturday and he probably will be the best all-around quarterback the Longhorns will face this year. Here, even more briefly than usual, is how the game went: FIRST QUARTER Oklahoma won  the toss and deferred. Texas took the ball and the Sooners go= t the wind. A false-start penalty on the game's second snap doomed that drive and forced a quick punt into the wind. Kris Stockton got a good roll on the low kick to the OU 43. Heupel hit four of five passes to cover the 57 yards in six plays to give OU a 7-0 lead with 11:37 left. TB Hodges Mitchell made=  a great run after catching Applewhite's third-down pass to pick up a UT first down =01) but it was the only one in the first quarter.  On their second tr= y, the Sooners went 77 yards in 11 plays and ran the score to 14-0 with 3:30 left. A  holding penalty on the kickoff forced Texas to start frrom its 8. Another three-and-out series and punt out of the end zone gave the Sooners = a short field at the UT 43. They were on the move again at the UT 29 when the period ended. SECOND QUARTER The UT defense got a great leaping interception in the end zone from CB Quentin Jammer, but it was disallowed and he was called for pass interferen= ce instead, giving OU a first down at the 2. They scored on the next play for = a 21-0 lead with 14:24 left. Starting QB Major Applewhite almost connected wi= th freshman WR Roy Williams for a 45-yard completion, but the officials ruled = he lost the ball on the way down and it was ruled incomplete. The Horns couldn= 't make a first down and J. T. Thatcher ran Stockton's punt back 53 yards to t= he UT 11. A personal foul on the runback set them back to the 26, but they scored in two plays for a 28-0 lead with 12:40 remaining. Chris Simms came = in at quarterback and hit Williams for a first down, but a delay-of-game penal= ty negated it and Simms' next pass was intercepted by OU LB Rocky Calmus, who returned it for still another OU touchdown and a 35-0 lead with 11:30 remaining. That brought Applewhite back in and he hit WR Montrell Flowers f= or a nice gain on first down, but an illegal motion penalty forced a punt. The Sooners scored again, giving them a 42-0 lead with 4:43 left. At this point= , OU's offense had been so dominant that it had faced only seven first downs all day and had converted all of them. Texas offense, meanwhile, had one first down. The UT offense finally came to life, driving 80 yards in seven plays to leave OU on top, 42-7, with 3:00 left. Mitchell got the TD from seven yards out on a pass from Applewhite. The Sooners were driving again when the half ended. It was their only drive in the first half that did not result in a TD. At the half, OU led in first downs, 18-5, in rushing yardag= e, 110-13, and in passing yardage, 182-106. THIRD QUARTER Texas finally forced OU to punt quickly to start the second half, but Applewhite, under a big rush, threw an interception that was run back to th= e UT 24. OU scored in two plays for a 49-7 lead just 1:07 deep. Simms came ba= ck in at QB and played the rest of the way. OU again drove deep into Texas territory, but freshman DE Kalen Thornton's sack of Heupel forced the Soone= rs to try a field goal and it went wide.  The Sooner's next TD came after a fumble by WR Montrell Flowers at the UT 17. That made the score 56-7 with 1:26 left. Then Victor Ike, probably the swiftest of all the Longhorns, got loose on the kickoff and Sooner DB Michael Thompson caught him from behind = at the OU 17. It was an 81-yard return. But the Horns lost four yards on two plays and were facing third-and-4 at the OU 21 when the quarter ended. FOURTH QUARTER A pass interference penalty against OU gave Texas a first down at the  6. Mitchell got five yards, then backup TB Kenny Hayter took an outside toss f= or the TD to make it 56-14 with 14:09 left. OU came right back for its final T= D, driving 73 yards, primarily on runs by Griffin.   900 Number Updated Daily  I update my 900 number daily with football and football recruiting news. Th= e number is 1-900-288-8839. It costs $1.59 a minute. You must be 18 to call.  Coach's Corner  Coach Mack Brown said Sunday he accepts the blame for the big loss to Oklahoma, and he said the Longhorns have to bounce back because they still have a season to play and a lot of goals to accomplish if they play up to their capabilities. ""After reviewing the film, I still stand by what I said yesterday,"" Brown said. ""They outcoached us, they outhustled us, they outplayed us. They totally dominated the game, and when that happens, it comes back to me. It'= s my fault."" But he said the team still has a chance to repeat as the Big 12 South champion. ""Last year, we were 1-1 (in the Big 12) at this point. We're at t= he same spot as we were last season."" Asked if he thinks the team has a chance to rebound and win the title again= , he said, ""no question about that. We're far from out of anything. We just h= ad a poor, poor performance yesterday in a game that was very important for us and our fans. For me to just throw out the season because of that would be totally asinine."" He noted that Oklahoma, after it's loss to Texas last year, beat Texas A&M, 51-6, the following week, and Stanford, after giving up 69 points to Texas last year, won the Pac 10 championship and Rose Bowl berth. ""There is a lot of anger after a loss like this by our fans,"" he said. ""Wha= t I will do this week is not look at the paper, I won't watch TV or listen to the radio. I'll be working hard all week trying to get us back on track."" He said he thought the Longhorns were ready to give a good performance against the Sooners, but he said, after three straight losses to Texas, the Oklahoma players might have just been hungrier. ""Our seniors had a chance to beat Oklahoma four straight times,"" he said. ""Some of them were crying. Most of our younger players were in shock."" He said a loss like this one forces coaches to re-evaluate everything. ""We'= ll definitely go back and look very closely at everything we're doing. We'll t= ry to simplify things."" He said some of the Longhorn players played well, but he said most of them ""played hard, but didn't play well."" ""The defense had been playing so well for us,"" he said. ""It didn't even loo= k like the same defense. Part of it was (OU QB Josh) Heupel. He played great.= "" ""We had a lot of mental mistakes,"" Brown said. ""We just played poorly and w= ho knows why we played that poorly? You guys will start looking at the things = we should change. The fans will start looking at the things we should change. I've got to look at things that I think will work. I've got to get them bac= k on track."" Asked if he thinks there is a chance the team could fall apart because of t= he loss to the Sooners, Brown said, ""This team won't fall apart. It's a very young team with a lot of heart, a lot of class. We'll go back to work to fi= x things, simplify things."" He said the key thing is for him to be truthful with his players this week about the things they did wrong, the things they did right and the goals th= e team still can accomplish. ""This is a bad week to be going to Boulder,"" he said, noting that Colorado upset A&M in College Station last week. ""We won't ever forget this (OU) gam= e, but we still have goals to accomplish. We're still in the race for the championship in our conference."" ""The players are embarrassed and I know I'm embarrassed, but we've got to pull back together and get back to work. We've got to go back and make sure we are fundamentally sound.""    10th Anniversary  This is the final issue of my 10th year of publishing True Orange. Next wee= k will be the first issue of my 11th year. While this is not a happy occasion because of the football game, my first issue was after a Texas win over OU and UT is 7-3-1 against the Sooners since True Orange began. Thanks to all of you for your continued support.  True Orange Observations  This was one of those games where a team has to  figure out what went wrong= , try to correct it, and then forget it because a game like this can be a cancer that ruins a season. Remember UCLA, 66-3, and 1997? Mack Brown won't ask for my suggestions on this, and I'm sure he can figure it out for himself, but if I were in his shoes, here is what I would do rig= ht now: 1. Give a royal chewing out to my players, my assistants and myself, becaus= e this game was an embarrassment to all Longhorns. Then I would say there are=  a lot of games left to play and this game needs to be put on the shelf and th= e Colorado game should be the start of a new season for a team with a lot of goals left to accomplish. 2. Figure out the few things that have worked on offense and build future game plans around them. By the same token, I'd figure out the plays that haven't worked and quit using them. The two up-the-gut plays the Horns used on their first two plays Saturday for zero yards have been unproductive all year. Texas rarely has a running play outside the tackles, but the sweeps usually work when they are tried. I'd also ditch that sideline pass that travels 30 yards for a potential 1-yard gain =01) or an interception for a = TD =01) and start throwing downfield more often. To open the game against Oklahoma State, the Longhorns had a four-yard run and two pass completions on their first three plays and didn't pick up a first down. 3. Pick a QB and go with him. Each QB has to be nervous, knowing that if he throws an interception, he'll be jerked. 4. Quit being so predictable on offense. Example: when the Horns line up in=  a two-back offense and the tailback goes in motion, Texas has passed or been sacked trying to pass 100% of the time this season. There has been one run = by a UT fullback all year =01) Brett Robin's touchdown in mop-up duty against = OSU. That formation invites an all-out blitz. 5. If the run isn't going to be a big part of the offense, go to the shotgu= n with four wideouts as the basic formation. It gives the quarterback a bette= r chance to complete his passes, as OU QB Josh Heupel demonstrated to near perfection Saturday. Game Notes . . * Oklahoma QB Josh Heupel, one of the nation's top passers, had 34 net yard= s rushing Saturday, which was more than the 20 yards gained by the Longhorns' leading ground gainer, TB Hodges Mitchell. * This was the second most one-sided game in the series, trailing only the 50-0 Oklahoma victory in in 1908. Texas leads the series, 55-35-5. * The Sooners 534 yards and 28 first downs are both school records against the Longhorns. * This was the fifth most one-sided defeat in Texas history. The bottom 10 are: 1.  1904    at Chicago      68-0 2.  1997    UCLA            66-3 3.  1988    Houston     66-15 4.  1908    at Oklahoma 50-0 5.  2000    Oklahoma        63-14 6.  1901    at Kirksville   48-0 7.  1956    at TCU          46-0 8.  1906    at Vanderbilt   45-0 9.  1956    Oklahoma        45-0 10. 1991    Miami           46-3  Baseball Team Starts Practice  The Longhorn baseball begins fall practice Wednesday with 12 lettermen back from last year's team that qualified for the College World Series. The team will practice through Oct. 27, and the annual Fall World Series wi= ll be played from Oct. 25 through Oct. 27. All the practices will be open at Disch-Falk Field, and all the practices will be in the afternoon, but exact times have not been announced.

2022-04-14 06:17:36+00:00,false,6,"  Part 2  Scouting Oklahoma State The Longhorns open defense of their Big 12 South championship Saturday at 1= 1 a.m. against Oklahoma State in a game that will be televised by ABC. The Cowboys opened their season with a 36-26 win over Tulsa, then blanked Southwest Texas, 23-0, before suffering their first loss at the hands of nationally ranked Southern Mississipp, 28-6, Saturday. The Cowboys have one of the most balanced offenses in college football, averaging 191 yards rushing and 178 passing. The Longhorns, on the other hand, have lived and died by the pass this season. However, they ran the ball better last week and hope to be able to test the Cowboy's defense, which is No. 1 nationally against the run. QB Tony Lindsay has always played well against Texas, but he has had injury problems throughout his career and he was knocked out of the loss to Southe= rn Mississippi with a shoulder injury in the third quarter. RB Reggie White, a 230-pounder with good speed, has been the go-to guy on t= he ground for the Cowboys. White could pose a problem for the Longhorns because their normally stout middle defense has been weakened by injuries to DTs Shawn Rogers (knee), Stevie Lee (foot) and Ryan Haywood (shoulder). It is doubtful that Rogers, an All-Big 12 selection, will be able to play Saturday. Redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs played well against Houston after Rogers was hurt, but depth will be a problem unless Lee can return. He and Tubbs were the second-team tackles. Defensively, the Cowboys are led by an outstanding front four, headed by en= ds Zac Warner and Juqua Thomas, who had 13 sacks each last year to lead the te= am. The Cowboys are inexperienced in the secondary, but it won't matter if Warn= er and Thomas can get to the UT quarterbacks before they throw. The Horns should win this one, but it could be close. Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis): =01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01= )=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)= =01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01)=01) Texas                     Oklahoma State Offense (106) 65.3       Rushing Avg.

Colorado is winless, but the Buffaloes have lost by narrow margins to three very good teams and they are always tough in Boulder, so K-State probably will have all it can handle after playing four patsies in a row to open the season.

Ross, an outstanding man-for-man defender, said he had scholarship offers from Alabama, Arkansas, Baylor, LSU, Oklahoma, Texas A&M and others, but sa= id he committed to Texas ""because I've always been a Longhorn fan, and I reall= y like the Texas coaches."" He said Darryl Drake and Everett Withers were the two Texas coaches who recruited him, and he said Withers, the Texas secondary coach, came to see him play in his second game this season. He is a big, fast corner with long arms, but don't look for him to get many picks this year because he doesn't get many passes thrown his way because h= e is so good at tight man-for-man coverage. I went to Waco Friday night to see the Lions play Tyler Lee. Waco LB Derric= k Johnson scored one touchdown on an 11-yard interception return and just generally wreaked havoc on Lee's efforts to make a game of it. Waco won, 34-9, and Johnson is as good a linebacker as I have seen in Texas recently. He is 6-3 or 6-4, weighs around 205 and he can really run. He has the frame to carry 230 pounds without losing any speed. He says Texas is his No. 1 choice, but he also says he probably will take a= ll five official visits before making a decision. Other schools in contention are A&M, FSU, Oklahoma and UCLA, but he says, ""I'd like to play pretty close to home so my friends and family could see m= e play."" His teammate, DT Sharod McGowan, is listed in the program as being 6-2 and 260. He doesn't look that heavy, but he is a dominating player, too, on occasion. McGowan is very quick and might be better suited to playing DE at the colle= ge level.He doesn't play with the same intensity as Johnson, but he can domina= te a game when he plays all out. FB James Buchanon of Sarasota, Fla.,  and DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia HS in Placentia, Cal., both took their official visits to Texas last weekend, and their families said both had great times. Buchanon was heading home Sunday night, but Jakes wasn't going back to California until Monday morning. Neither had committed as of Sunday night. DE Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., is the only other recruit who has taken an official visit to Texas so far this year. Other recruits who attended Saturday's game were OL William Winston of Houston Madison, safeties Dewayne Brandon of Temple and Rufus Harris of La Porte, and two top recruits who have already committed to Texas =01) super = OL Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter and DB/WR Brian Carter of The Woodlands. Th= ey were on unofficial visits.  Winston, who dominated Aldine's fine DE Lawrence Hooper when their two team= s met earlier this season, said, ""He told me last year I was the best offensi= ve lineman he faced all year, and I wanted to be sure he didn't change his min= d."" Winston said he enjoyed the game and getting to meet the Texas players and coaches. ""They have a classy operation with classy people,"" he said, adding that UT, A&M, UCLA, Tennessee and LSU are his top five schools right now. Here's a list of the Horns' 16 early commitments: Offensive Line (7) Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter Abe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village Alfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC Mike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park Will Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls Roman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, Livingston Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, Longview Running Back (2) Cedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, Midland Lee Anthony Johnson, 5-11, 195, 4.4, Jefferson Linebacker (2) Yamil LeBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Killeen Ellison Lance McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, Jefferson Defensive Back (5) Cedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.4, San Antonio Holmes Aaron Ross, 6-1, 182, 4.42, Tyler Kendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, Wolfforth Frenship Braden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.5, Euless Trinity Brian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands * * * * RECRUITING NOTES: QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch is not blessed wi= th great receivers this year, but his team is 4-0 and it defeated defending private school state champion Houston St. Pius, 22-12 Saturday night, with Nordgren running 14 yards for one TD and hitting a 13-yard pass for another= . He completed six of nine passes for 70 yards and ran four times for 21 yard= s. He says he will visit LSU and Kentucky the next two weekends, and probably will be ready to commit to Texas by Oct. 15. . . Brent Rawls of Shreveport Evangel, the other top QB Texas is pursuing, had an awesome game Thursday i= n a battle between Louisiana powers Evangel and and Shreveport Byrd. Rawls completed 22 of 37 passes for 477 yards and three TDs and ran for 42 yards and two more scores to lead Evangel to a 49-45 comeback victory. He visited Purdue last weekend and will visit Florida State the Oct. 14 weekend. He al= so is considering LSU . . Midland Lee, which had won back-to-back state titles in Texas, picked the wrong year to tangle with Louisiana powerhouse West Monroe. Lee hung with West Monroe for a half before falling, 36-8. Benson, who is running behind all all new offensive line (he is one of only two starters back on offense), scored Lee's only TD when he broke loose for 78 yards on his third carry. He wound up with 151 yards on 23 carries and also caught a 17-yard pass to account for most of the Rebels' yardage.  Softball Team Gets Big Pledge Cat Osterman, a super 6-1 left-handed pitcher from Houston Cypress Springs, has committed to play for the Longhorn women's softball team. She said she will sign with Texas during the early signing period that begi= ns in November. In adding to pitching for her high school, she was the ace pitcher last summer for the Katy Cruisers team that won the national title for the ASA 18-and-under Gold Division, which was the top national group. At the ASA National Tournament in St. Louis, she struck out 106 in 53 innin= gs and pitched one perfect game and one no-hitter while going 7-1 against the top high school seniors and college freshmen in the country. Osterman pitched against the U. S. Olympic team last summer while playing f= or the Katy Cruisers and struck out 11 of the 16 batters she faced while allowing just one hit in five innings. The Cruisers were the only team to take the Olympic team to extra innings, losing 1-0 in eight innings. The only other pitchers who struck out more Olympians were professional tea= m pitchers who went seven full innings, and none of them struck out more than 12. Carol Adcock, Osterman's coach at Cypress Springs, said, ""She could have go= ne anywhere she wanted. Every top softball program in the nation wanted her."" Adcock said Osterman compares favorably with former Longhorn All-American a= nd current Olympian Christa Williams at a comparable stage in their careers. ""Cat doesn't throw quite as hard as Christa did in high school,"" Adcock sai= d, ""but she has more movement on her pitches. She is as dominating as any high school pitcher I have seen."" Osterman had a 16-4 record last season at Cy Springs. She gave up only one earned run during the season and had an ERA that looks like a misprint at 0.08. Adcock said she struck out 377 in 169 innings last season, averaging 15.6 strikeouts per 7-inning game. Adcock said, ""Her best pitch is a rise ball. It's great, but she also has a very good drop ball and a great curve."" UT softball coach Connie Clark can't comment on recruits until they sign, b= ut Osterman is clearly the kind of dominating pitcher she has been looking for since Williams skipped her senior season to play on the Olympic team. Osterman's final five schools were Texas, Stanford, Washington, Oklahoma an= d UCLA. She also is an outstanding student who ranks in the top 10% in her class. S= he is dedicated, too. She was pitching to her dad in the family driveway when = I called her Sunday at 6:30 p.m. to confirm her commitment.  Top Pitcher Commits to UT Luis Cortez, 5-11, 180, a hard-throwing right-handed pitcher with outstandi= ng control, has announced he will sign a baseball scholarship with the Longhor= ns. Cortez had a 0.82 ERA at Sinton last year and he played with a top AAU team= , the Ohio Thunder, this summer and went 4-0 with one save and a 0.91 ERA. He was the youngest player on the Ohio Thunder and was one of only three players on the team with remaining high school eligibility. His best pitches are a slider and a fast ball that has been clocked as high as 92 miles per hour, but is consistent in the 88-89 mph area. He also has = a good curve and a changeup. He averaged two strikeouts per inning at Sinton last season. Cortez also is an outstanding student. He makes straight A's and is fifth i= n his class.

2022-04-14 06:17:16+00:00,true,6,"  Jerry Scarbrough's True Orange The Internet Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful  Volume 10, No. 24, September 25, 2000  Defense, Special Teams Dominant in 48-0 Rout; Longhorns 2-1 Heading into Big 12 Action  The Longhorns stampeded past the Houston Cougars, 48-0, Saturday night in Austin, posting their first home shutout in nine years and getting dominati= ng play from the defense and special teams. The victory got Texas back on the winning track and pulled the Longhorns up to No. 13 in both major polls. The Longhorns are 2-1 heading into their Big 12 opener Saturday against Oklahoma State. The Longhorn defense was so dominant that it scored two touchdowns, and Houston, which has one of the nation's most potent offenses, got inside the Texas 20-yard line only two times. The defense blocked a field goal to blunt the first threat and sacked Couga= r QB Jason McKinley, forcing a fumble, to kill the second one. Special teams, a headache a week ago in the loss at Stanford, were outstanding. Kris Stockton punted for a 45.6-yard average and had three pun= ts killed inside the UH 20, including one at the 1-yard line. UT also blocked = a field goal and got a special teams touchdown when Quentin Jammer caused a fumble on a punt and Michael Ungar recovered it in the Houston end zone. The offense started slowly, making only two first downs and getting only on= e net yard in the first quarter, but the great defensive effort provided a safety net and the offense started moving more efficiently as the game progressed. Head coach Mack Brown and offensive coordinator Greg Davis said the offense has been under so much pressure to play better that they thought the player= s were a little too tight to start the game. McKinley was one of the nation's top passers heading into the game after three straight 300-yard passing game, but a fierce Texas pass rush limited him to 173 yards through the air on 14 of 34 passing and sacked him nine times for minus 59 yards. The Horns also picked him off twice and returned both for touchdowns. Here, briefly, is how the game went: FIRST QUARTER Texas won  the toss and deferred. Houston drove to midfield and punted. Sophomore Chris Simms' got the start at quarterback for Texas, but his firs= t pass bounced off WR Montrell Flowers' hands and was intercepted by Cougar F= S Hanik Milligan at the UT 37. The Longhorn defense held, with LB Everick Raw= ls getting a sack, and Mike Clark tried a 39-yard field goal, but UT LB Tyrone Jones blocked it. But the Horns couldn't move and had to punt. Then the defense took over, putting Texas on top to stay. Redshirt freshman SS Dakar= ai Pearson, getting his first start in place of the injured Lee Jackson, intercepted McKinley's pass down the middle and galloped 42 yards untouched to put Texas on top, 7-0, with 6:56 left. Moments later, Stockton got a gre= at punt that went 63 yards and was killed at the UH 1. The Longhorn defense forced Houston to punt from the 3 and TB Hodges Mitchell ran the kick back = 16 yards to the 27. Applewhite came in at QB and backup TB Victor Ike got 4 yards, then 6 more to the 17 behind good line blocking. But the Cougars swarmed Ike for a 1-yard loss on the last play of the quarter. The Cougars had a big statistical advantage for the quarter, leading 5-2 in first downs and 61-1 in total offense, but, thanks to the blocked field goal and the defensive TD, UT led, 7-0. SECOND QUARTER Applewhite fumbled the snap, but recovered it for a 3-yard loss. He hit Mitchell for 8 yards to the 13, and Stockton kicked a 30-yard field goal fo= r a 10-0 lead with 13:26 left. Pearson recovered a Cougar fumble a minute lat= er at the Cougar 37, and the Longhorns' third TB, Kenny Hayter got five yards = in two tough runs, then Applewhite hit freshman WR B. J. Johnson for 17 yards = to the UH 14. A sreen pass to freshman WR Sloan Thomas lost 4 to the 18, but then Applewhite found Johnson again with a quick pass in the flat and he turned on the speed to the 1-yard line. Ike scored on the next play and Stockton's kick gave UT a 17-0 lead with 9:34 left. The Longhorn defenders again forced a quick Houston punt, but Applewhite threw an interception to give Houston another shot from midfield. Simms came back in at QB on the ne= xt series and played the remainder of the quarter. At the half, despite having three passes intercepted and having gained only 86 yards, the Longhorns wer= e in control at 17-0. Houston had only 88 yards offensively. THIRD QUARTER With Applewhite back at the controls, Texas opened the second half by drivi= ng 58 yards to set up a 39-yard Stockton field goal that raised UT's lead to 20-0 with 11:20 left. A 16-yard run by Mitchell and passes of 17 and 11 yar= ds from Applewhite to WR Montrell Flowers did most of the damage on the drive. The Cougars came right back with their only sustained drive of the game, zipping from their own 22 to the UT 6, but DE Cory Redding sacked McKinley and he fumbled, with Redding covering the loose ball. That was the Cougars' last scoring threat. The Longhorns punted quickly, but Jammer's jarring tackle forced a fumble on the return and Ungar fell on it in the end zone f= or another Texas TD and a 27-0 lead with 8:29 left. Neither team threatened again in the quarter. FOURTH QUARTER Applewhite hit Mitchell for 27 and Flowers for 15 on the Horns' first possession, then Mitchell ran 12 yards to the Houston 2. Hayter came in and got the TD to give Texas a 34-0 advange with 9:51 left. On Houston's next possession, UT LB O. J. McClintock intercepted McKinley's pass and returned it 23 yards for a score and a 41-0 lead with 9:21 left. Simms came back in and engineered the Horns' final TD drive, hitting passes of 12 yards to backup TB Ivan Williams, 16 to Flowers and then the 6-yard scoring pass to fullback Matt Trissel with 3:11 left. The Horns almost scored again in the final minute when Simms hit true freshman WR Sloan Thomas for 44 yards to t= he Cougar 10, but Williams fumbled on the final play. SUMMARY The Texas defense was a picture of consistency Saturday, never allowing Houston to get anything going offensively. The Cougars  ran 21 plays for 61 yards in the first quarter, 15 plays for 2= 7 yards in the second period, 11 plays for 57 yards in the third quarter and = 23 plays for 53 yards in the fourth quarter. The Texas offense started slowly, running 12 plays for one net yard in the first quarter, getting 19 plays for 85 yards in the second period, running = 20 plays for 102 yards in the third quarter and wrapping up with an 18-play, 161-yard final period. UT-OU Likely 11 a.m. Start The official announcement won't come until noon today, but it's pretty certain that the Texas-Oklahoma game will begin at 11 a.m. on Oct 7 in Dall= as and will be televised by ABC.  Computer Guru Nixes Horns  Jeff Sagarin, the MIT mathermatics graduate who rates football teams for several major publications, currently has the Longhorns right in the middle of the Big 12 pack. Sagarin has Nebraska No. 2 in the country and No. 1 in the Big 12, followed by Kansas State at 13th and second, Oklahoma at 16th and third, Texas A&M a= t 21st and fourth and Texas way back at 34th and fifth.  900 Number Updated Daily  I update my 900 number daily with football and football recruiting news.

Coach's Corner  Coach Mack Brown said Sunday afternoon the Longhorns are improving in a lot of areas, but still need to play better. ""On defense, our secondary has improved a lot,"" he said. ""Our young defensi= ve ends are playing a lot better. Last night was one of the few times that we didn't give up big plays in the passing game. We had a good pass rush, and the secondary did a good job."" ""Offensively, we are starting to run it a little bit better, but we are sti= ll not running it like we need to,"" he said. ""I also think we are gaining a lo= t of depth."" ""Our special teams last night were outstanding,"" Brown said. ""They were as good as they have been since we got here."" He said TB Hodges Mitchell was chosen as the offensive player of the game, and FS Quentin Jammer, whose hard tackle on a punt forced a fumble that resulting in a Texas' touchdown, was the defensive player of the game. He said three players shared the honors for the special teams. They were LB Tyrone Jones, who blocked a field goal, Jammer and walk-on Michael Ungar, w= ho covered the fumbled punt Jammer caused for his first collegiate touchdown. Brown said he was pleased the offense did ""score four of the five time it g= ot in the red zone, with the only failure being the one at the end of the game= ."" He also said some of the Longhorns' young defensive players really came of age against Houston. Brown said sophomore DE Cory Redding ""played by far his best game,"" and he said redshirt freshman DT Marcus Tubbs ""had two of our nine sacks. ""We're really excited about his quickness off the ball and his explosiveness. He a= nd (redshirt freshman safety) Dakarai Pearson were really pleasant surprises."" Asked about throwing deep in the final minute of the game, Brown said, ""It'= s really a hard decision when you look at it. My job is to do what's best for our football team."" He said the two big factors to consider were that sophomore QB Chris Simms ""needed some confidence, and Houston had just gone for a fourth and six at their 45-yard line."" ""We had five freshmen in there at the end of the game and Chris hadn't had = a lot of success. I wasn't trying to run up the score, but I have to do what'= s best for our team.""  INJURY UPDATE: Brown said the rash of injuries at defensive tackle has real= ly cut into the team's depth. All-Big 12 Shaun Rogers suffered a sprained ankle on an illegal chop block and Brown said he won't have any idea how long Rogers will be out until he talks to the team doctors Monday. Freshman Stevie Lee (sore foot) and redshirt freshman Ryan Haywood (sore shoulder) didn't suit up for the Houston game. Brown said Haywood might hav= e a rotary cuff problem, which might require surgery to repair. Safety Lee Jackson, who missed the Houston game with a strained hamstring, = is expected back for Oklahoma State. Freshman wide receiver Roy Williams also suffered a bruised arm early in th= e Houston game, but it did not appear to be an injury that would sideline him against Oklahoma State. Junior offensive tackle Mike Williams sustained a bruised collarbone that sidelined him for the rest of the game, but its severity is not known.  Football Notes . .  Five players scored their first touchdowns as Longhorns. They are redshirt freshman safety Dakarai Pearson, who had a 42-yard interception return for = a score; sophomore linebacker O. J. McClintock, who ran another interception back 23 yards for a touchdown; redshirt freshman running back Kenny Hayter, who scored on a 2-yard run; sophomore fullback Matt Trissel, who ran six yards for the final touchdown, and walk-on Michael Ungar, who recovered a fumble in the end zone. * * * * The official statistics for the game credited Texas with eight sacks, but coach Mack Brown said Sunday the defensive staff said the team had nine sacks. Either way, it's great pass rushing. Defensive ends Jermain Anderson and Cory Redding had three of them. Defensive coordinator Carl Reese has be= en saying he needs to get more production from his ends, and he got his wish Saturday night. * * * * The victory gives the Longhorns a 14-7-2 lead in their matchups with the Cougars. Texas leads 8-4-1 in games played in Austin. * * * * The home crowd of 81,592 was the 14th largest in Royal Memorial Stadium history and was the ninth sellout in the last 11 home games. Nine of the to= p 16 crowds in school history have come during Brown's tenure as head coach. * * * * The Longhorns are 16-0 under Brown when they outrush their opponent. Texas had 96 net yards rushing Saturday. Houston had 13. * * * * The Longhorn defense has denied opponents a first down in 22 of 38 possessions this season. * * * * Texas has returned three fumbles for touchdowns in its last nine games afte= r going 50 straight games from 1995 to 1999 without one. * * * * Texas' last home shutout was 32-0 over TCU on Nov. 16, 1991. The last shuou= t was last season's 62-0 victory over Baylor in Waco.

2022-04-14 15:29:16+00:00,true,6,"  Scouting Colorado  Colorado, playing the toughest schedule in the country, was winless in four games before storming into College Station and ending the Aggies' 22-game home winning streak, 26-19, last week. And the Buffaloes get to play the host this week when Texas comes to mile-high Boulder for a 2:30 p.m. game Saturday. It will not be televised. ""That sure got my attention,"" said Texas coach Mack Brown. ""College Station is a tough place for the visiting team."" Colorado coach Gary Barnett has had a tough year up to last week. The Buffaloes opened the season with a 28-24 loss to Colorado State, then fell = to Southern Cal, 17-14. Next up was Washington and the Huskies prevailed, also by a 17-14 score. Powerful Kansas State pulled away in the second half for = a 44-21 victory. After the K-State loss, Barnett threatened to strip the Buffalo decals off his players' helmets if they didn't start playing better. Barnett went with true freshman QB Craig Ochs  all the way against A&M, and he came through big, hitting 15 of 25 passes for 239 yards and one touchdow= n and running 18 yards for another touchdown. Sensational freshman RB Marcus Houston is out with an injury, but Cortlen Johnson dented the tough Aggie defense for 99 yards and a touchdown Saturda= y. WRs Javon Green and Roman Hollowell are swift and productive and TE Daniel Graham also is a threat. Defensively, the Buffs are led by a trio of returning linebacker starters, headed by Jashon Sykes. The Buffs return five offensive and six defensive starters from a team that went 7-5 last year in Barnett's first season at the helm. For the Longhorns to win, the defense has to prove the Oklahoma game was a one-time disaster and go back to playing smash-mouth defense. It also has t= o pressure Ochs into some freshman mistakes. Offensively, the Horns have to come out with their best shots early. They haven't scored an offensive TD all year and haven't moved the ball at all i= n some of their first quarters this season. Unless the offense plays better than it has been playing, it will be tough to win this game. Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis): Texas                               Colorado  Offense (104)   78.8         Rushing Avg.

Tommie Harris, the great DT from Killeen Ellison, is the No. 1 guy on UT's wish list, with Kaelen Jakes of Valencia HS in Placentia, Cal., the only other big defensive lineman who is seriously considering the Horns. This is a bad year for the big guys in the middle, so Harris and Jakes are = as important as anyone remaining on the Longhorns' wish list. Here's a list of the Horns' 16 early commitments: Offensive Line (7) Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter Abe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village Alfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC Mike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park Will Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls Roman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, Livingston Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, Longview Running Back (2) Cedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, Midland Lee Anthony Johnson, 5-11, 195, 4.4, Jefferson Linebacker (2) Yamil LeBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Killeen Ellison Lance McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, Jefferson Defensive Back (5) Cedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.4, San Antonio Holmes Aaron Ross, 6-1, 182, 4.42, Tyler Kendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, Wolfforth Frenship Braden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.5, Euless Trinity Brian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands As you can see, the Longhorns are almost through recruiting offensive linemen, running backs, linebackers and defensive backs. They want to sign one QB, one TE, one or two WRs, Waco's great LB Derrick Johnson (who had 30 tackles in his team's loss to power Tyler John Tyler about 10 days ago) super safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple and any other gre= at prospect who wants to come. They should be able to get a QB and TE, and they might get one WR, but probably won't be able to get two. They lead for both Johnson and Brandon. If things fall like they appear to be developing, there will be at least fo= ur spots left for defensive linemen, and possibly more, depending on whether t= he coaches will sign 25 players. But right now, it doesn't look like Texas will be able to sign a lot of top defensive linemen because the only ones who are leaning the Longhorns' way are Jakes, DE Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., DE Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson (who might be better suited to playing TE). Harris appears to be wide open. If the Horns don't fill all their defensive line needs this recruiting season, they should be able to next year because there is a much better gro= up of the big guys who are juniors this year. RECRUITING NOTES: QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch visited the Texas practice Thursday and spent a lot of time after practice talking to head coach Mack Brown and offensive coordinator Greg Davis, but he said he isn't ready to commit and wants to look around some more . . . The other QB Texas is recruiting, Brent Rawls of Shreveport Evangel, visits Florida State this weekend and says he might be ready to make a decision by next week. He also has visited Texas and Purdue, and Purdue appears to have a slight lead base= d on his belief that he would have a chance to play quicker with the Boilermakers. . . LB/DE Jonathan Jackson of Galena Park North Shore is bein= g recruited by most colleges, including UT, as a defensive end. Colleges are wanting DEs with great speed as outside pass rusher and Jackson ran a 4.56 = at a summer camp. That is very fast for a 6-3, 230-pounder.  Olympic Gold  Current and former University of Texas  student-athletes and coaches accounted for 22 medals at the 2000  Summer Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia which concluded on Sunday,  Oct. 1. Longhorns captured 18 medals - seven gold, nine silver and two bronze - whi= le Longhorn coaches worked with teams that won four gold medals. The 18 medals earned by the UT competitors tied Texas for first with UCLA nationally for most medals won by current/former student-athletes among all NCAA institutions. Former Longhorn basketball star Nell Fortner (1981), coached the gold-meal winning  U.S. Olympic Women's Basketball Team,  while current Longhorn men'= s track coach Bubba Thornton was an assistant coach forwho helped bring home three gold medals. Thornton tutored the U.S. in three events at the Games - the 400 meters, 400-meter hurdles and the 4x400-meter relay. Coaches do not receive Olympic medals. Here are the current and former Longhorns who won Olympic medals in Sydney: Gold Medals Erin Phenix, Women's 400-Meter Freestyle Relay (Swimming) Gary Hall, Jr., Men's 50-Meter Freestyle (Swimming) Gary Hall, Jr., Men's 400-Meter Medley Relay (Swimming) B.J.

The trouble is that few players have all of those abilities. But coach Jody Conradt, who already had two outstanding recruits with all four of those traits, landed two more last week for the Texas women's basketball team. Kala Bowers of Woodward, Okla., and Jody Bell of Chestermere High School in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, two 6-2 stars who are so versatile that they have played point guard at times, are the latest additions to Conradt's recruiti= ng class. Bowers is a national top 25 player who was one of just four high school underclassmen to be invited to try out for the 2000 junior national team She also considered Colorado, North Carolina, Stanford and Nebraska. She averaged 15.8 points and 7.4 rebounds last season. Her high school is 53-2 for the last two seasons, winning one Oklahoma stat= e title and finishing as the runner-up to the state champion the other season= . ""Last year, our point guard got hurt, so Kala played point guard for us,"" Woodward coach Kim Kramer said. ""She's so versatile she can play any position."" Bell averaged 14.5 points and 11.4 rebounds for Chestermere High School in Calgary. She was a member of the Canadian junior national team. She considered only warm-weather schools and wound up  picking Texas over Arizona State. Chestermere coach Brian Utley said Bell ""is a 6-2 player who can handle the ball like a guard, run the floor and shoot the three. She's an inside/outsi= de player with skills you normally don't see in a girl her size."" ""She has great all-around skills,"" he said. ""Texas got an outstanding playe= r. She really enjoyed her campus visit to Texas and really liked coach Conradt= . She said there were too many good things about Texas for her to go anywhere else."" Conradt also has commitments from forward Heather Schreiber, 6-2, of Windthorst, the state's hottest prospect, and 5-11 forward CoCo Reed of Houston Jersey Village. Like Bowers and Bell, they  are fine ball handlers and shooters. Schrieber and Bowers are both on at least one national top 25 list. Schrieb= er has led her volleyball team to three straight state championships and alrea= dy has been the state tourney MVP three times, with her senior season still remaining.  Support UT  Do you love UT athletics? Are you one of the thousands of loyal fans tho tu= rn out for football, baseball and/or basketball games? If you are, then you need to join the Ex-Students' Association.  If you hav= e already joined, recruit a  Longhorn friend and get him or her to join. There has never been a better time to join because this is the year the Ex-Students Association is sponsoring a membership campaign to better serve the university in many ways, including expansion of the scholarship program that already funnels nearly $2 million annually to deserving students who want a degree from the University of Texas. Jim Boon, executive direction of the association, says all UT supporters ar= e welcome to join, not just those who attended or graduated from Texas. ""We're letting people know you don't have to be a UT graduate to join the only organization that serves all of UT-Austin,"" Boon said. ""It's a matter = of pride that the country's largest university have the largest alumni association"" ""But even more importantly,"" he said, ""we couldn't continue to reward outstanding professors, encourage excellent teachers in our public schools, talk to legislators about improvements in higher education and provide all = of our other behind-the-scenes services without growing our membership."" Boon pointed out that whille every UT graduate is a Texas Ex, not every UT graduate is a member of the Ex-Students Association.

On another note, and I recognize there are signficant business issues you  both are dealing with, but we need to start thinking about the PRC process.   Specific questions that EGM business heads have asked are:   With the exception of VP's and above, do we want to isolate EGM employees  and review them only within EGM, regardless of location?   Or, do we want to segregate those EGM employees below VP that were formerly  EEL or ENA and review them separately with EEL or ENA?    (ex., Europe, Singapore, Sydney, etc. employees review with EEL;  North  American based employees review with ENA   We'll have to integrate the former CALME employees as well.    Shawna and I have ascertained that your management team would prefer a  separate EGM PRC so employees can be evaluated with peers in global emerging  markets, rather than with mature (and high revenue generating) markets like  North America gas and power.  Obviously, this is your call.  But time is growing near to plan for whatever  direction we decide to go in.  The PRC system opens for feedback on approx.  10/20/00.  PRC meetings need to be held between 11/20/00 and 12/15/00.  Thanks,  Cindy    ",I think doing an EGM only prc is probably the right way to go.

Steve can keep this individual busy with other projects  so it would not be a full time expense for Global Products.  our excel  spreadsheets methodology is not stable enough given the increasing  unreliability of the London servers which keep falling over and thus the  traders without any pricing tools.

In answer to your question, there are no special requirements.  Back in the  day, they would have been looking for actual pipeline scheduling experience,  but anymore, the liquidity for gas schedulers is so low, that they will  consider most people, with an analytical or coordinative type background.  I  think it's one of those things that once you ""get your foot in the door"", you  can move on from there.  Just be aware, that if you were to become a gas scheduler, it may require  working on weekends, and late nights from time to time.  As far as the next step, I would suggest that you just simply send an e-mail  to George Smith, Manager of Logistics on the Central Desk, and ask him if he  has time to visit with you.  I think that by simply expressing an interest,  and learning what his expectations are of a scheduler, and also, learning  what you can expect to learn from him, should serve as the first step.    Also, if he is interested, and does not have a position currently open, then  he will pass on your name to some of the other managers.  They're actually  pretty good about that!  I'll mention to George that you may give him a call.  Let me know if you have any further questions, or want to visit some more!  Take care!
