2022-04-29 09:38:00+00:00,true,4,"  OATI webCARES Security Officer,  As many of you already know, the JTSIN OASIS Systems will begin using X.509 Digital Certificates very soon.  In order to allow the JTSIN OASIS Administrators to efficiently link a customer's OATI Digital Certificate to their JTSIN OASIS user account, OATI has implemented infrastructure that will allow JTSIN OASIS Administrators to programmatically access webCARES Digital Certificate public key information.  The Digital Certificate public key information is made public in two formats: through the use of LDAP technology and as a CSV hourly file dump accessible from the OATI Certificate Repository website (www.oaticerts.com/repository).  However, due to input from our customers, each Company has to affirmatively choose to make their Company's public certificate data available through the LDAP interface and CSV dump.  OATI has specific customer's whose security policies and procedures require that this data not be made available to the public.  Therefore, each Company's Security Officer has the ability to make this data publicly available.  To make your Company's data publicly available, login to the webCARES System, then under Options, click on User Settings.  In the User Settings interface, you can check the box to ""Make Certificate Data Public"" then click on Submit to accept the change.  For all Company's, the default setting is to make the data non-public.  When a Company choose to make this data available to the public, the following Certificate information is available: Certificate Common Name, E-Mail address on Certificate, Certificate Status, Certificate Serial Number, Certificate Subject, and the Certificate Content in text format (base 64).  For those Companies that do not want to make this data available to the public but would like to send the information to a particular third-party, such as a JTSIN OASIS Administrator, the Security Officer can use the webCARES Certificate Report feature (available by the end of the week).  The Certificate Report feature allows the information listed above to be e-mailed to a designated e-mail address that is entered by the Security Officer.  The Certificate Report feature can be found under the Certificate Management page within webCARES.  The report is generated for all certificates the Security Officer displays on the Certificate Management screen.  The Certificate Management screen can be configured to display up to 200 Certificates simultaneously.  If your Company chooses to make its Certificate data public, please make the change in webCARES soon.  OATI would like to announce this new feature to the JTSIN OASIS Administrators shortly so they can begin testing with the data.  Finally, the JTSIN OASIS Administrators are making their final decisions on what vendor's Certificates to accept.  To make sure your Company's input is heard, please contact the JTSIN OASIS Administrators for the nodes that your Company does business with to let them know that your Company would like them to accept OATI's Digital Certificates.  If anyone has any questions about this new webCARES feature or the implications of this change, please feel free to contact me for more information.

2022-04-29 12:54:49+00:00,false,4,"  My Sincere Greetings,  I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your participation in the roll out of OATI webCARES certificates within your organization. I enjoyed the contact I had with you and because of your direct involvement with webCARES your users are properly authenticated to the ETS 1.7 Tagging system and their data is encrypted and securely transferred.  I would greatly appreciate your constructive feedback on webCARES by taking a few minutes to respond to the following questions. Your response will help us plan future enhancements to webCARES products, services and support to meet your needs.  Note: Please use ""reply"", NOT ""reply all"" when responding to this email.  1.) What improvements, if any, would you recommend to the webCARES web site to better accommodate your needs?  2.) What improvements, if any, would you recommend to the certificate delivery process (i.e. exporting and importing of certificates)?  3.) In general, do you believe it is better for company Security Officers or end users to have control of certificates and corresponding private keys?  4.) Do you believe there is a need for security related classes covering topics like SSL (https:), encryption, digital signatures, PKI and troubleshooting certificate related issues? Would you be interested in attending?  5.) Do you believe there is a need for a monthly security related newsletter covering topics useful to you in your role as Security Officer, Backup Security Officer, or Audit Officer?       5a) If interested in a security newsletter would you like to receive it in plain text, rich text, or html format?  6.) Do you want to pay approximately $170/ea for a DST certificates when your OATI certificates will work on OASIS nodes?   (if not please contact your OASIS node administrator(s) to let them know you do NOT want to pay for DST certificates and would like to use your existing OATI certificates for OASIS access? They are facing an important decision and feedback from you (their customer) is the only way they can make the RIGHT decision for your company.)  7.) OATI webCARES certificates are X.509 compliant and thus can potentially be used to secure any application. Just as OATI secured it's ETS (Tagging) system, you can use existing webCARES certificates, or create new ones, to secure your in-house or third party applications. Do you have any interest in using OATI webCARES certificates to secure your in-house or third party applications?       7a) If yes, would a ""Certificate Integration Toolkit"" or direct involvement from OATI staff be more useful to you?   Once again thank you for the important role you played in rolling out certificates within your organization and for your responses to the above questions. If I can assist with any certificate related questions please do not hesitate to contact me.    Sincerely,   Patrick Tronnier Principal Security Architect Open Access Technology International Inc.

Please let me know the instant Riverside refuses our energy delivery schedule. Since we have purchased the entire month of June, we will be in a position of liquidating that length should Riverside refuse delivery. Once Riverside refuses delivery,  we should plan on attempting to schedule at least once again to demonstrate their intent to continue to refuse delivery. Therefore, we need to discuss strategy before selling Riverside length back into the market or, alternatively, booking out with the energy supplier. Let me know if you have any questions.

She said, ""I  don't know, but it's always been there."" We gave her a note pad and asked if  she could draw a picture of it. So she makes a circle about 3 1/2 inches in  diameter and in the center she writes 710.
