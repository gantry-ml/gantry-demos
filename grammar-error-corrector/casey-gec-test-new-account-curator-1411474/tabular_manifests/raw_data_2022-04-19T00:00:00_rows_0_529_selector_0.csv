EOL and Broker market:  COB $30 @ $40. 2.  We put out a COB/MC market $4 at $7. 3.  In EOL, Product 1 = COB and Product 2 = MC.  Here's what will happen in the broker market:  (A) If someone hits my bid of $4 in the broker market I will BUY COB at something like $35, and I will SELL Mid-C at $31. (B) If someone lifts my offer of $7 in the broker market I will SELL COB at something like $35, and I will BUY Mid-C at $28.  If you take the same assumptions and show this market on EOL, here's my understanding of what will happen:  (C) If someone hits my bid of $4 on EOL, I will SELL COB at $35, and I will BUY MC at $39 (compare this with (A)) (D) If someone lifts my offer of $7 on EOL, I will BUY COB at $35, and I will SELL MC at $42 (compare this with (B)).  Clearly this doesn't work.  One possible solution, I think, is to examine what happens if you put out a COB/MC product on EOL, but switch the products such that Product 1 = MC and Product 2 = COB, and assume we put the underlying Product 1 market out as MC $30 @ $40.  (E)  If someone hits my bid of $4 on EOL, I will SELL MC at $35, and I will BUY COB at $39 (achieves same result as (A), which is what we want). (F)  If someone lifts my offer of $7 on EOL, I will BUY MC at $35, and I will SELL COB at $42 (achieves the same result as (B), which is what we want).  I realize (E) and (F) don't jive with our long contract description, but conceptually it works.  If you have any questions, let me know.

Assume you want to put out the COB/MC spread -4 at 4.  Also assume COB is 275 at 300.  As you know, if you put this out in the broker market, you would expect to buy COB $4 under Mid-C or sell COB $4 over.  If you want to duplicate these trades on EOL you could put out COB/MC -4 at 4, but here is what's going to happen (assume COB mid is 287.5).  If somebody 'hits' your 'bid' you will sell COB at 287.5 and buy Mid-C at 283.5.  If somebody 'lifts' your 'offer' you will buy  COB at 287.5 and sell MC at 291.5.  Effectively the EOL transaction turns your bid into an offer and an offer into a bid, or the title is COB/MC but the transaction is MC/COB.  The problem it seems to me is that, fundamentally, bid is always first, offer is second.  For this to work as is, the market would have to accept that, in all cases bid/offer applies except with EOL spreads where it's offer/bid.  This seems too confusing to me.  I'm not sure how you guys feel about  it, but I want to give you a heads up.","Message-ID: 595232.1075840065515.JavaMail.evans@thyme> Date: Thu, 19 Apr 2001 23:50:00 -0700 (PDT) From: sean.crandall@enron.com To:"

2022-04-19 15:07:44+00:00,true,1,"  T O D A Y    G O D    I S    F I R S T Marketplace Meditations by Os Hillman  Being an Overcomer  I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world. - (John 16:33)   ""Why does it seem that those involved in Christian enterprise find the way so hard? It seems as though it is harder for those who are committed Christians in business. Have you found this to be true?"" This was the comment from a business associate recently. My answer was a definite yes. In fact, if you were not a Christian and sought to do a similar business without regard to maintaining a biblical philosophy, the way would be much smoother sailing. It makes us think of the prophet who asked, ""Why do the wicked prosper?"" (see Jer. 12:1)  It is a spiritual principle of which we speak. When the Israelites crossed the Jordan before they entered the Promised Land, they fought only two battles. Then after they entered the Promised Land, they fought 39 battles. The way of the cross is not paved with lilies; it is paved with grace. When we seek to honor God in our business life, we will be met with opposition from the spiritual forces of this world. This is why each of us must commit ourselves to walking in the power of the Holy Spirit and to be as gentle as doves but as wise as serpents.  Do not be surprised when you find the way harder as a believer than when you were a non-believer. You now have more at stake among the spiritual forces that desire you to be defeated and ineffective.  Stand firm against the evil forces that desire to keep you from walking in freedom in the Promised Land. Jesus is your victory for every battle you will encounter.

""What if there were two doors to choose from; behind one door was the complete will of God for your life and behind the other door was how life could be according to your own preference. Which door would you choose?"" The struggle for most lies in the desire to follow God completely and the fear of what might be behind the door of full surrender. Most of us desire to follow God, but few of us will do it at any cost. We do not really believe that God loves us to the degree that we are willing to give Him complete permission to do as He wills in us.  If we desire to fully walk with Christ, there is a cost. We may give intellectual assent and go along with His principles and do fine; however, if we are fully given over to Him and His will for our life, it will be a life that will have adversity. The Bible is clear that humans do not achieve greatness without having their sinful will broken. This process is designed to create a nature change in each of us, not just a habit change. The Bible calls it circumcision. Circumcision is painful, bloody, and personal.  If God has plans to greatly use you in the lives of others, you can expect your trials to be even greater than those of others. Why? Because, like Joseph who went through greater trials than most patriarchs, your calling may have such responsibility that God cannot afford to entrust it to you without ensuring your complete faithfulness to the call. He has much invested in you on behalf of others. He may want to speak through your life to a greater degree than through another. The events of your life would become the frame for the message He wants to speak through you.  Do not fear the path that God may lead you on. Embrace it. For God may bring you down a path in your life to ensure the reward of your inheritance.

""What if there were two doors to choose from; behind one door was the complete will of God for your life and behind the other door was how life could be according to your own preference. Which door would you choose?"" The struggle for most lies in the desire to follow God completely and the fear of what might be behind the door of full surrender. Most of us desire to follow God, but few of us will do it at any cost. We do not really believe that God loves us to the degree that we are willing to give Him complete permission to do as He wills in us.  If we desire to fully walk with Christ, there is a cost. We may give intellectual assent and go along with His principles and do fine; however, if we are fully given over to Him and His will for our life, it will be a life that will have adversity. The Bible is clear that humans do not achieve greatness without having their sinful will broken. This process is designed to create a nature change in each of us, not just a habit change. The Bible calls it circumcision. Circumcision is painful, bloody, and personal.  If God has plans to greatly use you in the lives of others, you can expect your trials to be even greater than those of others. Why? Because, like Joseph who went through greater trials than most patriarchs, your calling may have such responsibility that God cannot afford to entrust it to you without ensuring your complete faithfulness to the call. He has much invested in you on behalf of others. He may want to speak through your life to a greater degree than through another. The events of your life would become the frame for the message He wants to speak through you.  Do not fear the path that God may lead you on. Embrace it. For God may bring you down a path in your life to ensure the reward of your inheritance. ""For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all"" (2 Cor. 4:17).     ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Bush said on Tuesday he planned to nominate three top businessmen to the civilian positions of Army, Navy and Air Force secretary at the Pentagon.   Bush chose James Roche, corporate vice president and president of the Electronic Sensors and Systems Sector of the Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC), to be secretary of the Air Force.   Before joining the private sector, Roche served as Democratic staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee and as principal deputy director of policy planning at the State Department.   Thomas White, Bush's choice for Army secretary, is currently vice chairman of Enron Energy Services (ENE).  He served in the Army for 23 years, retiring as a brigadier general and was executive assistant to the current Secretary of State Colin Powell  when Powell was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Bush also said he intended to nominate Gordon England to be secretary of the Navy.  England is currently executive vice president of General Dynamics (GD), where he has worked for 17 years.   All three nominees must be confirmed by the Senate.

In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world. - (John 16:33)   ""Why does it seem that those involved in Christian enterprise find the way so hard? It seems as though it is harder for those who are committed Christians in business. Have you found this to be true?"" This was the comment from a business associate recently. My answer was a definite yes. In fact, if you were not a Christian and sought to do a similar business without regard to maintaining a biblical philosophy, the way would be much smoother sailing. It makes us think of the prophet who asked, ""Why do the wicked prosper?"" (see Jer. 12:1)  It is a spiritual principle of which we speak. When the Israelites crossed the Jordan before they entered the Promised Land, they fought only two battles. Then after they entered the Promised Land, they fought 39 battles. The way of the cross is not paved with lilies; it is paved with grace. When we seek to honor God in our business life, we will be met with opposition from the spiritual forces of this world. This is why each of us must commit ourselves to walking in the power of the Holy Spirit and to be as gentle as doves but as wise as serpents.  Do not be surprised when you find the way harder as a believer than when you were a non-believer. You now have more at stake among the spiritual forces that desire you to be defeated and ineffective.  Stand firm against the evil forces that desire to keep you from walking in freedom in the Promised Land. Jesus is your victory for every battle you will encounter.

2022-04-19 03:39:19+00:00,true,2,"  With reference to our meeting that we had on Monday morning (4/2) regarding competing suppliers for capacity on the Crawford Lateral (Duke and EPFS), Planning has determined that the capacity of the Crawford lateral is 86 MMcfd with current facility configurations.  The pipeline capacity is based upon several conditions: 1) WT-1 max suction is 640 psig to allow receipts from Maljamar, Zia, and Attoka on low pressure line to MLV 109, 2) Maximum operating discharge pressure at Crawford CS discharge is 720 psig, 3) All receipts enter pipeline at end of lateral either through Crawford CS or into discharge, and 4) 720 psig max operating discharge pressure is based upon Crawford CS being online.  The maximum capacity through Crawford compressor station as limited by current staging, differential pressure, and horsepower at 720 psig discharge pressure is 60 MMcfd (typical suction pressure is about 450 psig.)  Having stated the above and regarding your request for a new EPFS interconnect, EPFS crosses the Crawford lateral near the end of the lateral.  Therefore, based on current firm obligations with Duke through Crawford CS at 20 MMcfd and actual volumes of 54 MMcfd, TW could physically take EPFS volumes of 32 MMcfd.  EPFS would need to have approximately 740 to 750 psig to get into TW line pressures anticipated near 720 psig.  Or if EPFS chooses to firm up all 50 MMcfd then Duke will be limited to 36 MMcfd physical capacity through Crawford CS.  It is a battle of firm, so however you slice it (volumes) is purely a commercial issue.    As promised, the Level ""A"" cost estimate for connecting EPFS to the Crawford Lateral is $400,000.  Tax gross ups are not included.  This proposal includes the major items listed below.  The proposed facilities should be designed so that TW Gas Control has telemetry and full remote control of volumes or pressures.

2022-04-19 09:14:00+00:00,true,2,"  FYI  Tuscarora Proposes to Expand Nevada Pipe  Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co. wants to expand its 229-mile pipeline system extending from Malin, OR, to capture a growing Nevada market. Under an application filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, it would add three compressor stations and a 14-mile pipeline extension to nearly double capacity to 220 MMcf/d, up from its current 124 MMcf/d. The in-service date, if approved, would be late 2002.  ""The expansion of the Tuscarora Pipeline is a key ingredient in the continued economic prosperity of northern Nevada and will meet the growing natural gas needs of new and existing customers well into the future,"" said Greg Galbraith, director of marketing and transportation for Tuscarora Gas.  The expanded capacity would serve two new power generation facilities in Nevada near Tracy and Wadsworth. Duke Energy plans to construct a 540 MW plant near Wadsworth, and Morgan Stanley is now constructing the 360 MW Naniwa Energy facility near Tracy.  The added capacity also would supplement the growing gas distribution needs of Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Southwest Gas Corp., which collectively distribute natural gas to all of northern Nevada and portions of northern California.  If FERC approves the application, Tuscarora said it would begin construction in April 2002 and begin service by the end of that year. The $60 million project expansion would be supported by long-term, firm transportation contracts ranging from 10-to-15 years that are contingent upon completion, said Tuscarora. The contracts would meet new power generation loads as well as growth in existing local distribution company markets.  ""The contracts that underpin this project demonstrate that there is a growing demand for natural gas in the markets served by Tuscarora and that Tuscarora is well positioned to capture that growth,"" said Ron Turner, CEO of TC PipeLines GP Inc., a subsidiary of TC PipeLines LP, which owns 49% of Tuscarora. It also is a subsidiary of TransCanada.  The pipeline was constructed in 1995 in a partnership with Sierra Pacific Resources and TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. It stretches from Malin, OR through Northern California to Sierra Pacific Power Co.'s Tracy Power Station near Reno.

2022-04-19 00:12:38+00:00,true,2,"  I quickly reviewed the Engelhard technology. It may have some nice applications.  Here are the issues with this nitrogen rejection technology. Adaptation of PSA technology, controls pore diameter (pd) at 3.7 A, and excludes methane which has a pd of 3.8 A and captures the nitrogen with a pd of 3.6 A. Nice feature, there is only a 15 psi pressure drop between the feed gas and the product gas for this technology. Issues At low inlet pressures or low nitrogen concentrations the methane recovery can be as low as 80% unless a recycle system is utilized.  Then the recovery rate improves to greater than 90%. As the inlet pressure increases, the recovery improves to 95+% but the recycle is approx. 15%. PSA technology has operated at a 600 psig maximum pressure economically, since it uses many 300 ANSI flanges and valves.  Higher pressures are achievable, but the gas recoveries costs are required to be offset the higher cost of 600 ANSI valves and flanges. The tail gas stream needs to have an economic home.  This stream operates in the 7 psia to 15 psia range and has a 300 Btu/scf. If the feed gas has a high concentration of C3s and C4+ a pre treatment BPSA is required to extract the heavies for the nitrogen removal PSA. Gas impurities like CO2 or H2S each require evaluation based on feed gas analysis.  Engelhard claims for 300 to 800 psia operating range, it can deliver 4% nitrogen in the residue gas and will achieve a 97.5% methane recovery for 5% nitrogen stream and the recovery falls to 90% methane for a feed stream of 25% nitrogen.

At suction pressure of 225 psig and discharge pressure of 560 psig the capacity is 36 mmcf/d.         The 36 mmcf/d is not a fixed capacity, if discharge pressure increases the capacity decreases.

I am working with the following assumptions:  1.      The 120 monthly spreadsheets will be maintained and updated to the EBB every hour between 6:00 am and 6:00 pm.  This is consistent with the historical updating since mid 1998, and I will continue to do this until the new CAS process is tested and released for your group to use(Best guess  2 more month-end nom cycles).  2.      The new CAS process will update the EBB with the same data as the spreadsheets.  We need to determine if we will include all receipt & delivery points, and if we will include a partial group/path list as we currently post.  Currently the spreadsheet contains only those points and/or groups that we thought our shippers might be interested in using monthly.  3.      The Gas Control Allocation and Facility Planning unsubscribed modules are adopting new standard group names,  I will let you review what those will be prior to any changes to production.   4.      The ROFR flag is now in the new CAS and will reduce the unsubscribe numbers past the contract expiration date.  This will be effective after CAS is released to you.  Currently the 120 monthly spreadsheets tract subscribe FT to the contract expiration date, no reservations past the expiration date.   Let me know if my assumptions are correct, and any changes that might effect the above efforts.  I need to let the IT group start their development process, as to,  What we will post from CAS?

Ideally, I would like no more than 3, Steve and Drew however agreed to no less than 5 years.  Their only qualification was if you concurred.  I understand we have made certain posting representations in our FERC Capacity Options filing.  Drew and Steve thought it better to wait until after the Options approval from FERC before we made any changes to the EBB.  Are you OK with this?  From a business perspective, posting TW capacity for 10 years reduces our negotiating leverage on long term contracts.

2022-04-19 00:52:42+00:00,true,2,"  Upon further review of previous recommendations to install recycle and cooling at CS P-2 to provide greater turndown, it has been determined that the P-2 turbine has too much horsepower and has single stage wheeling that would not allow turndown less than its current minimum capacity of about 125 MMcfd.  Previous attempts by Operations to turndown the P-2 unit using the surge valve for recycle allowed approximately 100 MMcfd before reaching high discharge temperature, but high suction pressures were available from P-1 compression in a north flow scenario.  Volume analysis over the past year to date indicated volumes through P-3 of 100 MMcfd; thus, with 150 MMcfd proposed to be scheduled through the NNG Gray I/C, a balance of 50 MMcfd would have to flow south to P-2.  Throughput analyses were based upon needing to have P-2 turned down to a volume of at least 50 MMcfd.  Additionally, P-2 throughput analyses considered available pressures that would be available on NNG's KB line.  KB line pressures can be expected to get as low as 600 psig; therefore, pressure drop from the NNG Gray I/C to P-2 suction would yield P-2 suction pressures between 570 to 550 psig for low volumes of 50 to 80 MMcfd, respectively.  Required discharge pressures at these volumes would be 850 to 885 psig.  The P-2 single wheel stage will not handle a differential pressure of 270 to 335 psig.  P-2 is designed to handle differential pressures of 180-190 psig.  Re-wheeling the P-2 unit (3 stage) is not a viable option due to the operational flexibility that would be required to maintain Panhandle Lateral certificate capacity of 250 MMcfd.  Due to the pressure spreads that would be required to meet low flow demands, consideration was given to add additional reciprocating horsepower at P-2 to handle low flow demands without P-1 online.  50 MMcfd throughput at P-2 would require 1200 HP and 80 MMcfd would require 2100 HP at pressure differentials of 270 and 335 psig, respectively.  The cost of adding horsepower and piping modifications at P-2 is not a feasible option for accommodating NNG-Gray volumes.  Also new air emissions permitting and regulatory filing would be a greater concern compared to installing a new line as follows.  The most viable option would be to install a new tap on the KB Line closer to P-3, install approximately 1.75 miles of 16"" from tap to P-3, and modify station yard piping for various control configurations.  The existing NNG-Gray measurement and control facilities would be relocated to the end of the new lateral and located inside P-3 plant boundaries.   This new tap, lateral and meter relocation option would provide the following benefits:  1. Receipt of 150-175 MMcfd 2. Greater operational flexibility utilizing NNG/TW synergies 3. Long-term operational reliability 4. Greater horsepower utilization at single location 5. Guarantee of receipt capacity from NNG regardless of low KB line pressure 6. Possibility of free-flow capacity from NNG not requiring P-3 compression during winter times with NNG Pampa on-line, which could be possible at high or  low flow conditions depending on TW pressures at Roswell (Sta. 9) 7. Fractional increase of O&M expenses at P-3 compared to higher O&M expenses of adding horsepower at P-2  A level ""A"" cost estimate for installing a new tap on the KB Line closer to P-3, installing approximately 1.75 miles of 16"" from tap to P-3, and modifying station yard piping for various control configurations would be $1,300,000.  Due to the complexity of configurations that P-3 is already capable of and introducing a new stream with various flow paths that may become possible, a field visit to the proposed construction sites would be recommended prior to submitting a Level ""B"" or ""C"" release.  See attached sketch for general route information proposed.  Moreover, the relocation of the NNG interconnect and installing the new lateral should create the opportunity for greater receipt volumes from NNG considering larger pipe and expanded I/C facilities because P-3 has plenty of available horsepower to utilize.  Actual conditions were provided by Operations from dates in the past where P-3 was actually compressing 370 MMcfd w/ units 3,4 & 5, Ps-599psig/Pd-874psig; also 265 MMcfd w/ units 2 & 5, Ps-540 psig/Pd-844 psig.  Depending on NNG conditions greater volumes than 150 MMcfd may be realized into TW having 250 MMcfd flowing south and additional volumes available to flow to Red Deer, Lefors and Cactus Laterals if needed.  I will be attending an offsite ETS Planning & Power Services department conference on Wednesday and Thursday.  Perhaps on Friday or early next week we should convene for further discussions via conference call with all interested parties call for direction of this proposal.

2022-04-19 15:26:34+00:00,true,2,"  Third Western Canada Pipeline Expansion Proposed  Where's that scorecard? It's never around when you need it. By our count there are now three new proposals on the Canadian side to upgrade service through southern British Columbia and into the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Westcoast Energy entered the Northwest expansion lists last week with an announcement of an open season to run through the end of May for more capacity on its Southern Mainline and Westcoast Alberta line to accommodate additional volumes from supply areas in British Columbia, Alberta and the Northwest Territories.  The supplies would be directed by Nov. 1, 2003 to ""growing market demand in the BC Lower Mainland and the U.S. Pacific Northwest."" Westcoast is looking to expand its Southern BC Mainline from Compressor Station 2 to the Huntingdon delivery area (Zone 4) by about 200 MMcf/d and its Westcoast Alberta line from Nova/Gordondale to ABC/Gordondale, westbound by about 100 MMcf/d. The Canadian pipeline said its latest proposal matches the timing of an expansion by Northwest Pipeline, which connects with Westcoast at the border at Sumas/Huntingdon.  The mainline expansion ""provides a very cheap expansion going straight south to Sumas. It can be done very quickly and very cheaply because it will loop existing line,"" said spokesman Robert Foulkes.It will start at the northern end from the T-South junction of various gathering lines, including the line south from the hot Northwest Territories development area. It's also possible the pipeline will look at a later expansion north of Fort St. John to increase the flow from that area. The Gordondale expansion also will bring in additional volumes from Alberta.  ""This is in response to very good exploration and production results. Our line has been operating almost full, consistently through the winter,"" Foulkes said.  Westcoast's proposal came a week after BC Gas Utility Ltd., said it was pursuing a plan to expand its brand-new Southern Crossing Pipeline also to increase pipeline capacity in southern BC and into the U.S. Pacific Northwest at Huntingdon, BC, across the border from Sumas,WA (see Daily GPI, April 4 <d20010404g.html>). BC Gas' plan calls for a 161-mile long expansion pipeline, costing about C$460 million. Questioned, Foulkes said he did not consider the BC line a competitor for Westcoast's proposal, since Westcoast would be providing direct service from the north through a less expensive looped line.  TransCanada PipeLine also has announced an expansion of its Nova Gas Transmission system and its BC System to its border connection at Kingsgate, B.C./Eastport, ID to match an expansion of PG&E GT Northwest (see Daily GPI, Feb. 26 <d20010226k.html>, March 26 <d20010326j.html>). Following an open season, TransCanada said it would expand its Alberta system by 227 MMcf/d and its BC system by 216 MMcf/d.  For its venture Westcoast is looking for binding commitments for 15-year contracts. For shippers with existing service on the two legs, ""relinquishment is being requested and will be considered."" Also, ""Westcoast is concerned about expiration of existing firm service agreements. Where appropriate, Westcoast may ask shippers to renew service for a mutually agreeable period.""  The expansion could increase the toll on the mainline by 1-2 cents (Canadian), and on the Alberta segment by a half a cent (Canadian).

2022-04-19 19:52:12+00:00,true,3,"  Just wanted to make sure you saw this from Les Rawson concerning Grays Harbor and Willamette. -Bill  Beginning immediately Enron has purchased Control Area Reserves service from BPA.   The allows Services to sell Unit contingent energy as hourly firm since BPA is suppling reserves for up to 60 Minutes. If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage RT should notify BPA dispatch immediately and make the reduction in the schedule during the next ramp. For example should Grays unit trip as 1333 RT would notify BPA and the sink that across the top of the hour for 1400 the schedule would be taken to zero for HE 1400. The bottom line is that 60 minutes is the maximum time BPA will carry the schedule.  Send me a e-mail concerning any reductions for Grays since the energy would need to be repaid back within 168 hours.  Also, for May Services sold 10 mw of UC energy to EWEB from Willamette all hours. As part of this sale Services bought 18 Mw of firm transmission from PACW to BPAT for all hours. 10Mw of this purchase will be used for the monthly sale with the remaining 8Mw used for day ahead and hourly sales. The Assignment Reference # 139990. The cost for this transmission is $2.72 per hour vs the $5.84 we normally pay for hourly non-firm so hopefully we can save some money on PAC transmission.  Also, beginning May 1 Services purchased Ancillary Services from PacifiCorp to allow Willamette's Unit Contingent energy to be sold as 1-hour firm with reserves. The procedure for dealing with inner hour cuts is similar to Grays with the exception of not calling PAC RT dispatch. Simply cut or reduce the schedule at the next ramp and note the derate in a e-mail to Services. This service adds .43 cents per Mw to the term sale costs. However, this service applies to Willamette's sales up to 30Mw.  Let me know if there are questions.

They wanted all of the plants to be built in other states such as Arizona and Nevada.  Environmentalists (fish people) were trying to get rid of the hydro dams in the Pac NW.  It is definitely an issue they, as well as California will experience this year as the dams are only filled to 55% of normal.  This equates to approximately 3000-4000 MWh short.

2022-04-19 04:56:06+00:00,true,3,"    1. Introduction: Why Do We Need Humans?  So you've decided to get yourself a human being.  In doing so, you've joined the millions of other cats who have acquired these strange and often frustrating creatures.  There will be any number of times, during the course of  your association with humans, when you will wonder why you have bothered to grace them with your presence.  What's so great about humans, anyway?  Why not just hang around with other cats?  Our greatest philosophers have struggled with this question for centuries, but the answer is actually rather simple:  THEY HAVE OPPOSABLE THUMBS.  Which makes them the perfect tools for such tasks as opening doors, getting the lids off of cat food cans, changing television stations and other activities that we, despite our other obvious advantages, find difficult to do ourselves.  True, chimps, orangutans and lemurs also have opposable thumbs, but they are nowhere as easy to train.  2. How And When to Get Your Human's Attention  Humans often erroneously assume that there are other, more important activities than taking care of your immediate needs, such as conducting business, spending time with their families or even sleeping.  Though this is dreadfully inconvenient, you can make this work to your advantage by pestering your human at the moment it is the busiest.  It is usually so flustered that it will do whatever you want it to do, just to get you out of its hair.  Not coincidentally, human teenagers follow this same practice.  Here are some tried and true methods of getting your human to do what you want:  Sitting on paper:  An oldie but a goodie.  If a human has paper in front of it, chances are good it's something they assume is more important than you. They  will often offer you a snack to lure you away.  Establish your supremacy over this wood pulp product at every opportunity. This practice also works well with computer keyboards, remote controls, car keys and small children.  Waking your human at odd hours:  A cat's ""golden time"" is between 3:30 and 4:30 in the morning.  If you paw at your human's sleeping face during this time, you have a better than even chance that it will get up and, in an incoherent haze, do exactly what you want.  You may actually have to scratch deep sleepers to get their attention; remember to vary the scratch site to keep the human from getting suspicious.  3. Punishing Your Human Being  Sometimes, despite your best training efforts, your human will stubbornly resist bending to your whim.  In these extreme circumstances, you may have to punish your human.  Obvious punishments, such as scratching furniture or eating household plants, are likely to backfire; the unsophisticated humans are likely to misinterpret the activities and then try to discipline YOU. Instead, we offer these subtle but nonetheless effective alternatives:  * Use the cat box during an important formal dinner.  * Stare impassively at your human while it is attempting a romantic interlude.  * Stand over an important piece of electronic equipment and feign a hairball attack.  * After your human has watched a particularly disturbing horror film, stand by the hall closet and then slowly back away, hissing and yowling.  * While your human is sleeping, lie on its face.  4. Rewarding Your Human: Should Your Gift Still Be Alive?  The cat world is divided over the etiquette of presenting humans with the thoughtful gift of a recently disembowelled animal.  Some believe that humans prefer these gifts already dead, while others maintain that humans enjoy a slowly expiring cricket or rodent just as much as we do, given their jumpy and playful movements in picking the creatures up after they've been presented.  After much consideration of the human psyche, we recommend the following: cold blooded animals (large insects, frogs, lizards, garden snakes and the occasional earthworm) should be presented dead, while warm blooded animals (birds, rodents, your neighbour's Pomeranian) are better still living.  When you see the expression on your human's face, you'll know it's worth it.  5. How Long Should You Keep Your Human?  You are only obligated to your human for one of your lives.  The other eight are up to you.  We recommend mixing and matching, though in the end, most humans (at least the ones that are worth living with) are pretty much the same.  But what do you expect?  They're humans, after all.  Opposable thumbs will only take you so far.","1. Introduction: Why Do We Need Humans? So you've decided to get yourself a human being.

I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their website.  I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.  I'm not saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's filings/online info.    2.  If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's obligations, then we are in great shape.  United Technologies is A+ rated, with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.  3.  If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we definitely need to see their financials/management notes.

2022-04-19 04:52:43+00:00,true,3,"      BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets has recently completed the first transaction for a new 60-day fixed price product for the lumber industry. Available for delivery in Houston and Dallas, the product is offered by Enron in the over-the-counter market and via Clickpaper.com, Enron's Internet-based transaction system dedicated to the forest products industry. The first transaction was completed via Clickpaper.com on March 14 with a major lumber buyer in the southern United States. This represents the first online fixed price transaction contract in the industry. With the growing volatility in the lumber industry, the availability of a long-term fixed price product provides companies with another opportunity to mitigate their exposure. Additionally, this transaction represents the convergence of Enron's increasing involvement in physical lumber transactions with our recognized expertise in financial risk management.  In addition, EIM has announced that it has completed its acquisition of the Quebec City, Canada newsprint mill and related assets from Daishowa Forest Products Ltd. In July 2000, Enron purchased Garden State Paper, a recycled newsprint mill located in Garfield, NJ. The acquisition of the Daishowa mill now positions Enron as the seventh largest producer of newsprint in North America. The Daishowa mill in Quebec City will now be called Papiers Stadacona. The new name has great historical significance to the local community in Quebec City. When Jacques Cartier first explored the mouth of the St. Charles River in 1535, the aboriginal people living there referred to the village as Stadacona. This is now the site of modern-day Quebec City.   Enron Freight Markets In March, Enron Freight Markets (EFM) completed the acquisition of Webmodal, Inc to help launch the traditional intermediary transportation business.  EFM also started its spot trading business and completed 981 transactions in its first month.  East Power Origination On Tuesday, April 3, the St. Lucie County Commission voted 3-2 to approve the Midway Energy Center near Fort Pierce, Florida, which is a 510 megawatt peaking power plant.

2022-04-19 22:08:53+00:00,true,3,"        By Timothy Gardner     NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Adding stress to an already frazzled power market, a nationwide coal shortage could spawn electricity brownouts in northeastern states and in the West this summer, experts said on Thursday.     While coal provides the country with 51 percent of its power, years of industry underinvestment and record prices for competing fuels natural gas and fuel oil this year have pushed utilities' coal stocks to their lowest levels since 1974.     In January, the last month of available government data, stocks at electric plants were 94 million tons, 27 percent less than a year earlier, according to the Energy Information Administration, the Department of Energy's number cruncher.     Thin coal stocks compound a U.S. natural gas shortage that led to rolling brownouts in California last winter. That came after a failed deregulation plan and amid natural gas infrastructure bottlenecks. Natural gas prices have fallen from last summer's all-time highs, but are still nearly twice what they were last year at this time.     ""In certain regions we would expect brownouts this summer,"" said Deck Sloan, spokesman for Arch Coal Inc. <ACI.N>, the nation's second largest coal firm. ""In California that seems to be a very high likelihood, especially given the situation with reservoir levels behind the hydro-dams in the West,"" he said.     Los Angeles has avoided brownouts, largely because it has a coal cache in Utah. L.A.'s power department is the largest participant in the 1,600 megawatt (MW) Intermountain Power Project in Utah. The project supplies L.A. with 14 percent of its power and lesser amounts to nearby cities Anaheim and Pasadena as well as parts of Utah.     One megawatt powers about 1,000 homes.     Mike Nosanov, the operating agent of the 1,600 MW Intermountain project, said the plant now has 700,000 tons of coal, or 60 days supply. ""That's more than enough to keep us out of trouble this summer,"" he said.  Still, L.A. mayor Richard Riordan has been meeting with Utah Governor Mike Leavitt to discuss adding another 500 to 1,000 MW to the Utah plant, though it would take years to add the capacity.      OVERLOADED RAILROAD     Another potential problem is stemming from the nation's largest coal producing state, Wyoming, which delivers coal to 24 states.     The two major railroads at Wyoming's Powder River Basin, Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe, operate a joint line out of the mines that has reached its capacity of 64 trains per day or more than 300 million tons per year.     ""The two lines could probably carry another 10 to 20 million tons (per year) out of Wyoming's Powder River Basin. Beyond that it may take additional investment by the railroads in order to get more production out of the basin,"" said Sloan.     The Midwest is also thirsty for Wyoming coal. A proposal to build a $1.4 billion coal rail project from Wyoming to power plants in the Midwest is in the works.     Hill and Associates, an independent industry consulting firm, agrees that Wyoming coal trains are at their limits, a problem that will take years to solve. ""The question is who is going to make the investment?"" asked Hill and Associates Vice President John Hanou. ""The mines or the railroads?""      COAL DROUGHT ALL OVER     Northeastern states, where years of production underinvestment has led to thin stocks, are also in danger, said Arch Coal's Sloan. ""We could also see the Northeast, if the summer is normal or hotter than normal, suffer brownouts as well,"" he said.     Adding to the mix, Massey Energy <MEE.N>, the nation's seventh-largest coal company, experienced flooding last month in one of its major mines in Appalachia.     ""In this current atmosphere, that is a hell of a big story, said Jim Thompson, general manager of Energy Publishing, a Hill and Associates affiliate.     And the EIA reported utilities so far this year are burning six percent more coal than last year. Prices on the spot market have jumped, though long-term contracts make up 80 percent of coal deals, which mean consumers will mostly be protected from rising prices.     But utilities may find themselves scrambling for coal. ""As far as we can tell there is no coal available anywhere,"" warned a Hill and Associates supply report this spring.     ""Brownouts are possible,"" said Lehman Brothers coal analyst Peter Ward. ""Utilities have gotten complacent. Coal has been a buyer's market for about two decades. That has suddenly changed in the past three months, and for many utilities with low inventories, that is a scary situation.""     Analysts said high coal prices should eventually spur increased production of the fuel, and new natural gas and coal plants will eventually clear up brownout threats. ""But we're not going to see much capacity come on line for at least three years,"" said Hanou.

2022-04-19 03:54:31+00:00,true,3,"  Group,  When doing an import or an export from California there are a few important guidelines to remember.  IMPORT-This must be FIRM.  A firm import is required so that we provide the spinning reserves to California (we do this by buying firm energy for the import).  If the import is non-firm, California will charge us their price for spinning reserve margins.  This could easily be $400 per mw come this summer.   EXPORT-This must be NON-FIRM.  A non-firm export allows us to provide spinning reserves to our bilat trading partners (or to simply sell the energy without spinning reserves as ""non-firm""), and NOT have to pay the California price for spinning reserve margins.  Conversely if we do a firm export, we would have to pay for California to supply spinning reserves.  And because California will sometime use actual purchased energy for spinning reserves, this could easily be $400 per mw this summer. California has also proposed cutting firm exports this summer, so a ""firm"" export does not imply that the energy would actually be exported anymore than nonfirm.  IF you have other questions.  Please let me know.  Thanks, Bill","Group, When doing an import or an export from California, there are a few important guidelines to remember. IMPORT-This must be FIRM.

2022-04-19 12:33:00+00:00,true,3,"  ENRON MS WALK - RAIN OR SHINE Saturday, April 21 Walk Begins 9:00 am sharp World Trade Center  121 SW Salmon Portland, Oregon   CONGRATULATIONS!  Your commitment to join TEAM ENRON has helped our TEAM be the LARGEST MS team in the state of Oregon.  This is a great achievement and one that we can all be proud of.  Your commitment to this Walk and the pledges you raise will help to find the cause and cure for multiple sclerosis.  At the time of this email notice, approximately 150 TEAM ENRON walkers have registered.  The following Q&A will provide instructions/directions in order for us to have a successful Walk this Saturday!  Where is the Enron MS Walk held this year? This year's Walk begins and ends at 1st & Salmon Street, near the Salmon Street Springs - in Waterfront Park.  Registration will be  directly across the street at Two World Trade Center (middle building of PGE's offices at 2nd & Salmon).  What time does the Walk begin and how far is it? The Walk begins at 9:00 am - rain or shine!  You can elect to walk in the 5K or 10K - no decision or commitment needs to be made; just decide the day of the event.  It is recommended, due to parking constraints, that all Walkers arrive downtown by 8:00 am, in order to complete required tasks before the Walk.    Can I bring my dog with me? You sure can!  All TEAM ENRON dogs are welcome to walk with their owners for this great cause.  All dogs should have leashes.  Just be sure to bring along your own pooper-scoopers for this purpose.   Where do I meet up with TEAM ENRON? TEAM ENRON walkers will meet around 8:30 am near Salmon Street Springs - look for the TEAM ENRON sign.  There will be lots of activity and people in this area, so plan ahead to meet up with your fellow TEAM ENRON walkers no later than 8:45 am.    I haven't received my TEAM ENRON t-shirt - what do I do? Because of the number of TEAM ENRON registrants and the various locations of our TEAM walkers, it may not be possible to deliver t-shirts to each walker.  Therefore, if you HAVE NOT received your TEAM ENRON t-shirt by the end of the work day on Friday, April 20, please plan on picking up your t-shirt between 8:00-8:30 am on Walk Day.  Pick-up location will be at One World Trade Center on the Bridge Level (at the top of the escalators).  T-shirts will be distributed at this location from 8:00-8:30 am  ONLY..  Am I suppose to wear my TEAM ENRON t-shirt at the Walk? Yes, yes, yes!  As the title sponsor of this year's Walk for the state of Oregon, we want to show off our name and support for this great cause!    What if I have NOT turned in my pledge form to a Team Captain before the Walk? No problem.  We encourage you to turn in your pledges at the MS registration tables at Two World Trade Center prior to the Walk that morning.  Most of you have received the yellow notice and white envelope in the mail from the MS Society.  This envelope is to be used to put your pledge form and collected dollars/checks in.  If you did NOT receive the yellow notice and white envelope in the mail from the MS Society, they will provide an envelope for this purpose at the MS Registration table.   Upon turning in your pledge form at the Registration table, you will receive an MS walk t-shirt.  (For those that have already turned in their pledges prior to Saturday, the MS Walk t-shirt will be delivered or sent to you.)  I thought I was pre-registered and the pledges would be picked up prior to the Walk. Again, because of the various locations for our Walkers, it may not be possible to pick up all pledges.   If your pledge form is NOT picked up prior to the end of the work day this Friday, you will need to do the following: 1) Pick up your TEAM ENRON t-shirt (instructions above) 2) Go to MS Registration Table to turn in your pledge form 3) Pick up your MS Walk t-shirt at the same time you turn in your pledge form. (You will only receive your MS Walk t-shirt once your pledge forms have been turned in.)  I have a friend that wants to walk but isn't registered, can they register the day of event? Absolutely.  Send that friend to the ""Walk On's"" table in the Registration area.  Be sure to have them sign on as TEAM ENRON walker!  Do I need to bring anything else with me for this Walk? If you plan on carrying anything with you, ie,identification, wallet, MS walk t-shirt, water, umbrella, camera, munchies, etc., you may want to carry a backpack.     Does Enron match employee contributions? Enron will match Enron Broadband Services and Enron North America employee contributions.  If you have not completed a matching form, please contact your team captain.  These employee contributions are matched 100% and adds up easily.  Is this tax-deductible and how are receipts given? You bet it is tax-deductible.  If a pledge is $75 or greater, a tax-deductible receipt will be sent directly from the MS Society.  However, if the pledge is less than $75 and a receipt is requested, a receipt needs to be provided by the Walker.  You can pick these receipts up at the MS Registration Table or contact Judy Timson, 503/886-0501 or email her at judy_timson@enron.net.  What if I have not collected all my pledges OR have forgotten my pledge form at home? Not to worry.  You have until May 25 to turn in your pledge forms and dollars to the MS Society, in order to be eligible for the prizes offered by the sponsors of this Walk.  If your pledges are turned in after the MS Walk, they should be sent as follows:     National MS Society    Portland Chapter    1650 NW Naito Parkway    Suite 190    Portland, OR  97209    (Phone 503/223-9511)  How does this work for TEAM ENRON prizes IF my pledge form does not get turned in the day of the Event? The TEAM ENRON deadline is earlier due to the key prize award of two round-trip airline tickets on Continental Airlines. In order to be eligible for this prize, you must have ALL your pledges into the MS Society by April 30th.   How am I eligible for the two round-trip Continental Airline tickets? One of the TEAM ENRON walkers will walk away with this grand prize.  On May 1, the MS Society will confirm with Judy Timson which TEAM ENRON walker successfully raised the most dollars.  Judy will then contact the grand prize winner by phone. Notification of the WINNING WALKER will be sent out, via email, to all registrants that provided an email address.  GOOD LUCK and continue collecting - you could be the lucky winner of this wonderful prize!   I thought there were other incentive prizes - what are they AND how am I eligible for those? For every TEAM ENRON walker participating in the MS Walk, your name will be in a drawing to receive one of the following prizes: ? Overnight Hotel Package at The Benson Hotel ? Overnight Hotel Package at The Riverplace Hotel ? Overnight Hotel Package at The Marriott Downtown Hotel ? Overnight Hotel Package at The Marriott Residence Inn This drawing will take place on April 25.  The winners will be contacted by phone; notification of these WINNING WALKERS will be sent out, via email, to all registrants that provided an email address.  Are kids allowed to walk and is there a Prize for them? Yes, kids can participate in the Walk.  All kids will be eligible for a $25 gift certificate to Toys-R-Us, with one lucky winner taking home this gift certificate.  This drawing will take place on April 25.  The winner will be contacted by phone; notification of this WINNING WALKER will be sent out, via email, to all registrants that provided an email address.  Are TEAM ENRON walkers to meet after the Walk? No, due to participating in the 5K or 10K and due to people's own walking times, it would be difficult to hold a gathering afterwards.  However, we encourage all TEAM ENRON walkers to enjoy the activities, booths, music, refreshments, food, etc., that will be provided at the end of the Walk.  What if I have questions? Please feel free to call Judy Timson, 503/886-0501 or email your question: judy_timson@enron.net.    Walk in good health and have great time!

I have asked Terri Sue to forward NUI's Notice Information (Exhibit A) to Stacy.  Stacy, upon receipt, can you please generate the final agreement?  2. Physical Transaction Agreement - I need to review Section 4 with Bob Lurie who will be back in the office tomorrow.  3. April Transaction Confirmation Letter - Stacy, this letter should be addressed to Thomas E. Smith, Director, Energy Planning (who signed the Confirmation).  Also, please confirm that the Exhibits are NUI Confirmation Nos. 31060 and 46669.  3. Swap Transaction Agreements - I am attaching a revised version of the Transaction Agreement and Exhibit for Swap V09140.4 from Enron's review. As Mark and I discussed, NUI Corporation, not NUI Utilities, will be the Guarantor. In addition, I have modified the form of Guaranty to make it clear that it only applies to these two Swaps; this is similar to what Enron had agreed to when we were contemplating an NUI Corp. Guaranty for the Enfolio Agreement.  I have made this change to the Guaranty because I am not satisfied that the discussion within the Confirmation that purports to limit the scope of the Guaranty is sufficient.  I think the limitations need to be set forth within the four corners of the Guaranty itself.   If acceptable, the same changes should be made to the Transaction Agreement and Exhibit for Swap V09140.5.  <<ENA Swap Confirm Red 4-16-01.doc>>   - ENA Swap Confirm Red 4-16-01.doc","Sara, Number 3 concerns the Swap piece of this deal.

Typos in the model should be caught and corrected while checking out with counterparties and running the CARP.  The ancillary service (spin) deals need to sum into the ancillary section at the bottom...not with the regular deal entry summary.  We need to use the reconciliation sheet when appropriate (which has not been used since Feb--and this will haunt us when Houston tries to check out March and April).  We do a good job trading for EPE and managing their system but I am not impressed with our attention to detail for this customer on deal entry.  I continue to see the same mistakes which suggests that procedure questions exist.  Please ask myself or a senior member of the group if you have any questions.  I look for us to improve going forward.

That puts the fixed price about $5.50 - $5.75.  Peak Palo Verde Bids are  Q3 - $520 Q4 - $190 Q1 2001 - $125  It looks like you are in the money at least through the end of the year.  We have been looking at the transmission issue.  What substation would you be able to deliver to?  We can determine if transmission is available.    Irrespective of availability, I still believe Salt River or APS will be the best physical bid for your energy as they can keep it in their system and avoid transmission.    I would like to push forward to get ISDA swap contracts in place with BHP.  I remember losing a deal with Francis Mcalister a few years ago despite being a better offer because contracts were not in place.  Enron North America does not have an ISDA with BHP.  We could also push to get a physical electricity contract in place.  I think we have a physical gas contract.  Would you like to push ahead to get contracts in place?  Let me know.  It is not too early to start the process as it typically takes a month or so to make it happen.  What would be the name of the counterparty?  You are the US subsidiary of BHP correct?

As for a volume cap, I don't think that one is necessary in this case.  Their TW contract limits them to 1000 MMBtu/day.  Any prices that are fixed will not include TW transport charges.

Dan J Hyvl 04/02/2001 08:55 AM To: Kim Ward/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: Eastern New Mexico Gas Company     Kim,  I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.   1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase ""with annual redetermination"" however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would suggest that the phrase be deleted. 2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap? 3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?    Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.

2022-04-19 11:37:25+00:00,true,4,"  To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge.   The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.  The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.  Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.  On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.  By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization.   Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to: Joe Deffner  853-7117 Alan Quaintance 345-7731","To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book.

2022-04-19 03:36:21+00:00,true,4,"  Good morning,  I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to update you regarding the Homestead Expansion Precedent Agreements (PA's) status.  As I presented in my letter to you last month, I expected to be in a position to distribute the  PA's this week.  However, that schedule was fairly aggressive and TCO Homestead project team is currently in the process of completing some critical analysis that we need to support our recommendations to TCO management.  TCO will distribute the PA's as soon as TCO management has reviewed and approves the recommendations made by the Homestead project team.  At this time, I am not expecting any significant delay and remain hopeful that TCO will be able to distribute the PA's during the week ending Friday, April 13.  (I am not superstitious!)  I apologize for any inconvenience this unexpected delay may cause you.  Please call your account manager or me if you have any questions  or special needs related to the Homestead PA's.  Thank you for your patience and support of this project.  I look forward to working with you in the near future.

2022-04-19 15:52:55+00:00,true,4,"  Hi Jay, I thought I'd send you some lite reading.  May provide a distraction for you from your normal day.  This is a first hand account I received from Capt Greider. He didn't (couldn't?) go into detail in some areas I would be interested in, but at least it is the true story and account.  Suprisingly not a whole lot different than the media reported.  The ROC vs PROC point was interesting.  Shows the thought process of an insecure government. Anyway enjoy. Dad  AN INSIDE LOOK AT THE CHINA RESCUE MISSION April 12, 2001 By Captain Guy Greider Continental Airlines Since the mid-air collision on April 1, 2001 between a U.S.  Navy EP-3 surveillance aircraft and a Chinese jet fighter, I had watched the news with mild interest.  This was mostly due to the proximity of Guam to China.  I never dreamed that I would play a role in this intensely watched international drama. Somewhere in the negotiations between the United States and the Chinese Governments, it was decided that a civilian aircraft should be sent to retrieve the 24 crewmembers being detained on Hainan Island, China.  A call was made to Continental Airlines headquarters in Houston, Texas. Continental was chosen because of its Guam base and its ability to launch this kind of operation at a moment s notice.  From there, the operation took shape through the tireless efforts of many people working behind the scenes in a coordinated effort between the airline, the military, and the State Department. On Saturday, April 7, 2001, I received a call at home from Captain Ralph Freeman, Continental Micronesia Director of Flight Operations.  Ralph told me that the military wanted to charter one of our jets to conduct a rescue mission and asked if I would be one of the crewmembers.  I said yes without hesitation. Later we were told that we would need to get passport pictures taken in case the Chinese Government required visas.  We got the required photos and were under the impression that we would leave immediately.  However, the negotiations slowed over the demand from the Chinese that the U.S.  issue an apology that the U.S.  was unwilling to give.  Meanwhile, the Continental crew remained on call 24 hours a day.  Our Uniforms were laid out and our bags were packed and waiting by the door. On Wednesday evening April 11, 2001, at about 6:30 PM Ralph called again to say that the two parties were very close to an agreement to release the U.S. crew and to come to the airport.  Upon arrival, we were given a briefing sheet listing the information that we would need to conduct the flight. We would carry a Repatriation Team consisting of Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force specialists, 14 people in all.  Doctors, Psychologists, and communications people with lots of gear showed up on the ramp near the airplane, ready to board.  They were all dressed in casual civilian clothes. The 155-seat jet was fitted with 2 full stretcher kits bolted in over rows of seats complete with Oxygen tanks and I.V.  bottles.  They did not know the condition of the 24 detained crewmembers and they were not going to take any chances.  They were prepared. When our crew was fully assembled, it consisted of 11 people.  2 pilots to fly the jet and an extra to provide relief because of the extensive flight time involved. They were Captain Tom Pinardo, Captain Pierre Frenay and I.  We also carried 5 very experienced Flight Attendants. They were Debbie Percell, Susanne Hendricks, Jean Tang, Cynthia Iverson, and Beverly Haines.  Our 2 onboard mechanics were Peter Lum and Julius Aguilo. Our load planner was Mike Torres. At about 9:30 PM we received a call asking that we arrive in China no earlier than 6:00 AM, just about sunrise.  It was obvious that the entire exchange would be photographed and they wanted daylight conditions.  We estimated that a 2:15 AM departure from Guam would put us on the ground in Haikou precisely at 6:00 AM local China time.  (2 hours earlier than Guam) Some of us just stayed on the plane, others accepted the company s invitation to come to the Continental President s Club, a local VIP lounge at the airport to try to get some rest.  It was difficult to get any rest with our much-anticipated mission so near. By 1:00 AM the pilots were back in the briefing room going over the weather, flight plan, fuel requirements and everything else that goes into a flight. Again, we loaded up the airplane and finally departed Guam International at precisely 2:15 AM. The stretcher kits and medical gear were not the only special additions to the airplane.  The company had loaded a special file into the navigation database of the flight management computer (FMC).  This allowed us to gain access to navigation data needed to operate in this part of China, which is not in our normal route structure.  The Repatriation Team carried sophisticated equipment to communicate with the military and government officials that would monitor our progress throughout the flight. The route of flight took us straight west from Guam toward the Philippines along the G467 airway.  About half way across we turned north directly toward Hong Kong. This routing was designed to avoid flying through Taiwanese airspace, something that the Chinese could consider offensive. Approaching the Chinese coastline, we contacted Hong Kong radar control. After establishing radar contact with us, the controller gave us a short cut to expedite his traffic flow.  This was bad because it cut off considerable distance and would result in arriving too early.  We compensated by slowing our airspeed until the computer again estimated a 6:00 AM arrival.  The instant we turned across the short cut, the interphone rang from the back of the plane.  They wanted to know why we had deviated from the flight plan. We told them it was due to Hong Kong traffic and that we had adjusted our airspeed. We were still on schedule. Now we were approaching our destination, Haikou airport on Hainan Island. Captain Pierre Frenay was at the controls.  The weather was 2000-ft overcast with 5 miles visibility and light winds out of the east.  Pierre made an ILS approach to and landed on runway 9.  Haikou airport is much the same as many other airports in the world that serve jet transport aircraft.  It has an 11,000-ft runway with standard lighting and navigational facilities.  We touched down at 6:07 AM.  The first early morning light was beginning to illuminate the sky. The local air traffic controller instructed us to follow a vehicle that was beside us on an adjacent taxiway.  He led us to a remote part of the airport, away from the main terminal buildings.  Once we had parked and shut down the engines, we saw many uniformed Chinese military personnel and vehicles.  They did not appear to have weapons.  Portable stairs were brought up to the airplane and we opened the main cabin door. The Repatriation Team that we carried had been briefed to close down all of their communications equipment prior to landing and put it away.  They were also briefed to remain in their seats in a non-threatening posture in case the Chinese military came aboard.  The first and only person to come aboard was an Air China employee.  He spoke English and was to act as the translator between our group and the Chinese military.  He instructed us to have everyone fill out both arrival and departure documents. He collected all of our passports and left the aircraft. Before he left, he said that only one person at a time would be allowed to deplane. Peter Lum, one of our mechanics went down to supervise the re-fueling and servicing of the airplane.  When that was complete, I went down to do the walk-around inspection.  I did this rather slowly because I wanted to have a chance to look around.  While I was out on the ramp, a skirmish developed between people who were trying to climb a wall to photograph our aircraft and the Chinese police.  Somehow, CNN managed to carry our arrival and departure live. Once the airplane was serviced and ready to go, we looked anxiously around for any sign of the buses that carried our 24 detainees.  Before that could happen however, we had a problem to deal with.  A U.S.  military General who was on the scene to assist in the transfer came storming up the stairs and demanded to speak with the Captain.  Tom Pinardo responded.  The General said that the entire mission was now in jeopardy.  A document called the general declaration, which is standard on all international flights had listed the destination as Haikou, China R.O.C.  The initials ROC stand for Republic of China which is ..  Taiwan!  The Chinese were very upset over this.  Tom quickly crossed out ROC and replaced it with P.R.O.C.  the Peoples Republic of China.  This seemed to satisfy them. With the airplane ready to go and the paperwork complete, 2 buses pulled up and the 24 U.S.  service men and women saluted as they bolted up the stairs and settled into the back of the plane.  When the last one was aboard, our passports were returned to us.  The stairs were withdrawn, the cabin door closed, and we started the engines and departed. It was my turn at the controls. Once airborne heading straight south we broke through the clouds into the bright sunshine.  Pierre made a PA announcement that we were over international waters and leaving Chinese airspace.  A great cheer rose from the back of the airplane.  A short while later we received a telephone patch over the HF radio from Mr.  Joseph Prueher, U.S Ambassador to China.  He wanted to speak with Lt.  Shane Osborne the 26 year old EP-3 Aircraft Commander.  Lt.  Osborne came to the cockpit and put on a headset.  The Ambassador told him that on behalf of the President of the United States and the entire country he wanted to say welcome home .  He went on to say how proud he was of everything the crew had done from their airmanship in saving the lives of the crew and aircraft, to their conduct on the ground once they had been detained.  They had truly done an excellent job. After his conversation with the Ambassador, Lt.  Osborne stayed in the cockpit for quite a while and told us his story pilot to pilot of what had happened during and immediately after the mid-air collision with the F-8 Chinese fighter.  The fighter came up under their left wing.  This pilot made 2 very close passes previously that day.  He apparently misjudged the intercept and his vertical stabilizer struck the outboard left propeller on the EP-3.  The U.S.  plane was in straight and level flight on autopilot at the time. The fighter broke into two pieces and plunged into the sea.  The U.S.  plane rolled to the left almost inverted, the pilot lost control and they began to lose altitude. The Chinese fighter had raked back across the fuselage and knocked off the nose cone causing the aircraft to buffet wildly.  When the nose cone departed the aircraft it collided with and damaged the number 4 propeller on the right wing.  The collision punctured the pressure vessel and the EP-3 depressurized.  The collision also knocked off the pitot tubes eliminating airspeed and altitude indications in the cockpit.  It also knocked off the forward bracket for the HF radio antenna.  The antenna then flew back and wrapped around the tail. We were almost upside down and totally out of control Osborne told us.  The dive continued and some crew members donned parachutes.  At about 8,000 feet, Osborne regained straight and level flight.  They considered ditching the aircraft in the South China Sea but dismissed that option because it was certain to result in loss of life.  They headed for the nearest land, Hainan Island.  The U.S.  crew now faced the most difficult landing of their lives. They made numerous mayday, mayday, mayday radio calls on internationally recognized emergency frequencies.  The Chinese did not respond.  Somehow, they managed to get the airplane on the ground. Their next immediate task was to destroy the sensitive electronic surveillance equipment aboard the EP-3. Meanwhile the Chinese military had approached the aircraft in vehicles and were yelling at them through loudspeakers to deplane.  The next 11 days would be a very uncertain time for them. When we met them, they told us that they had not been abused or mistreated. Their food was adequate and plentiful.  Sort of like eating in a Chinese restaurant every day one of them said.  On the forth day, they got some coffee.  On the fifth day, some cokes were provided. The crew did not know what kind of transport would be provided for their return home.  They were pleased and surprised to see a chartered airliner from the United States. The rest of the flight from Haikou to Anderson AFB on Guam was uneventful. During the 5 hour flight the crew was treated to the movie Men of Honor and enjoyed a first class meal.  We did not know it at the time but our landing at Anderson AFB was carried live on national television. We taxied to the parking ramp at Anderson where many people had turned out to welcome all of us home.","Hi Jay, I thought I'd send you some lite reading.

We are throwing what the French call ""un party d' bachelor"" for the bon bon homme.  (I do not speak French, but I think that last bit rhymed.)  I really do not have a lot of information yet, I just wanted to make sure that everyone keeps the date open.  The main event is Saturday,  May 12th (a week before the actual wedding).  But, I think we oughta make a weekend, and then a week of it, since at least Eric and Adam will be free for the entire week between the bachelor party and the wedding.  It will take place in Houston, but naturally will have global repercussions.  Out of towners and drunkards, don't worry about a place to stay, I've got lots of room.  Oh, don't get too excited, but I might be able to get the KLF to perform. They've got a hip new sound!  In the meantime, I would love to hear any ideas you might have for themes, party favors, and the like.  Maybe something to do with the Cardinals, Hawaiian shirts, or malted milk.

2022-04-19 08:33:53+00:00,true,4,"  Hi Chris: I really appreciate your input. You are correct that APS or SRP would be best fit for physical bid. For last couple of weeks, I have spent considerable time with APS.  BHP management is still considering the possibility and have not made any final decision. Unfortunately, the summer is around the corner. We still need to send an application to FERC for EWG. FERC has waived the market based rate (section 205) filing through December 31, 2001 (It helps). I am expecting that most of the key questions would be addressed next week and decision made by BHP.  BHP generates power at 12.5 kV. This power would be transformed to 115 kV through APS sub-station in San Manuel and then wheeled to Saguaro Sub-station by Red Rock. I understand that the transmission capacity may not be available beyond this point. APS has started the interconnection study and expects to complete it by May 29.  I have presented your ideas to our President & VP and are being looked into. I will let you know early next week what BHP decides. Thank you. ..........

2022-04-19 07:42:51+00:00,true,4,"               Dan:  To help your prepare for your meeting in Stamford, here are some thoughts.  PG&E Large Packages Index Trends  1.   PG&E Large Packages is the interconnection between El Paso/Transwestern into PG&E.  The interconnection between El Paso/Transwestern and Kern into SoCal is referred to as SoCal Border.    2.   PG&E gas supply comes in from three main pipelines:  PGT (Canada), El Paso/Transwestern (San Juan and Permian) and Kern River (Rockies).  With the exception of a few very cold days in Canada and the Northwest, the cheapest supply comes from Canada.  The other two pipes are similarly priced, based on the incremental cost of gas out of the Southwest and what options the supply has.  There is always some marginal demand for supply out of the Southwest into PG&E, but it can be a small number of only about 500,000 MMBtu/d in a shoulder month and 1,000,000 MMBtu on a peak day.  When it is a low demand day PG&E large packages will trade like Malin (PGT interconnect to PG&E).  On a peak day PG&E large packages trades like SoCal border.  3.  Effective April 1, El Paso changed the way gas moves on their system.  It used that anyone with primary delivery point capacity to PG&E could deliver into SoCal on a primary basis.  Now, if you have PG&E primary, you can only get into SoCal on an alternate delivery point basis.  Because capacity is constrained, PG&E primary capacity will generally not flow into SoCal.  Thisis why PG&E Large Packages trades at a discount to SoCal Border.  4.  PG&E large packages is the relevant index for the PP&L deal:  PG&E trades at a significant discount to SoCal because of the reasons listed above.    Anyone with primary SoCal delivery will want to go into SoCal.  This leaves the PG&E capacity as the marginal capacity that folks could use for delivery to Griffith.  If anyone owns primary delivery into SoCal they will use it there.  Citizens is offering Griffith a discount relative to these suppliers.  The good news is that PG&E delivery is still very strong because given the gas supply balance in California the marginal supply out of the southwest is needed.    5.  PG&E large packages is becoming more liquid:  Now that El Paso has changed the way gas moves on their pipeline there is a much more distinct difference between the types of capacity on El Paso.  Folks that own capacity want ways to hedge its value.  Enron has recognized this and plans to introduce the PG&E large packages point on Enron Online, our internet based trading system.  Trading volume at the PG&E point has increased in the last month and is expected to continue to increase.  This is good for Citizens as the liquidity makes the index more reflective of the market.  It also reduces the risk that the index doesn't print as has often occurred in the past.  (See historical data attached).  It also reduces the spread between the bid and offer at that point.  6.  PG&E Large Packages has gotten much stronger:  it used to be that the San Juan/SoCal Border spreads barely covered variable transport expense.  Now the demand is much stronger in CA and the transportation value has increased.   California is short storage due to growth in demand with the new power plants and the strong economy.  Although demand due to the economy is likely to fall, the new power plants and short storage position still create a very bullish situation.  For example, current valuations for the PG&E index are in the attached spreadsheet below:            ","Dan: To help you prepare for your meeting in Stamford, here are some thoughts.

Feel free to call us at Wild Goose Storage Inc. to discuss what opportunities are available to align your storage needs with this new pipeline capacity. Keep in mind that our open season for new storage capacity at Wild Goose closes on May 22. For information contact either Ben Ledene with Wild Goose in Calgary at (403) 266-8192 or Chris Price and Mark Baldwin with Interstate Gas Services in California at (925) 243-0350.  From today's Gas Daily: Copyright , Financial Times Energy, 2001  Colorado Interstate Gas is holding an open season through May 31 to evaluate whether it should add capacity from the Rockies to Nevada and northern California markets.  The project, called the Ruby Pipeline, would total up to 750 million cfd of incremental capacity and would begin service in late 2003. Bid sheets can be obtained from CIG's Web site at www.cigco.com/business/colorado/index.html.  CIG said gas production from the Rocky Mountain supply basins ""is projected to increase dramatically over the next few years and the Ruby Pipeline Project will provide access to these supplies."" The Ruby project will consist of approximately 850 miles of 30- inch and 36-inch pipeline running from western Wyoming through Utah to Elko, Nev., to points of delivery near Reno, Nev., Yuba City, Calif., and Sacramento, Calif.  CIG said it anticipates interconnecting with the northern California gas storage facility of Wild Goose Storage, which is currently holding its own open season to evaluate expanding its facility.  Ruby is considered the second phase of a project involving CIG and Questar. The first phase, which entails an agreement between Questar and CIG, involves Questar developing a 74-mile looping project in Utah. Questar plans to sell 50% of the ownership interest in the phase I project to a CIG affiliate, CIG Gas Supply, on the day the phase I facilities go online. CIG Supply will then lease its 50% interest in the project back to Questar under a 33-year lease, which would give Questar full operational rights.  For more information about the Ruby project, contact Craig Coombs at 719-520-4387, Ed Miller at 719-520-4305, or Tom Dobson at 719-520-3792.

The following information  applies to those individuals who are beginning an exercise program for the  first time or who are are renewing and exercise program after a lengthly  layoff.  Many of us become overzealous when initiating an exercise program in  anticipation of losing weight, toning up or getting fit.  We start out too  aggresively only to lose our enthusiasm, or worse, create health problems  and/or injuries that we are trying to avoid.  It is natural to expect results as quickly as possible. However, results will  not occur overnight.  Attempting to counteract years of sedentary living in a  couple of weeks is unrealistic and dangerous.  It takes time and continuous  effort.  The most important concept to remember when starting a new exercise program  is o begin safely, slowly and progressively.  Always go at your own pace- too  much, too soon may be counterproductive.  Please take a moment to read the attached document to familiarize yourself  with the guidelines for a safe and healthy exercise program.

Dates are for having fun, and people should use them  to get to know each other.  Even boys have something to say if you listen  long enough.  --Lynette, age 8   On the first date, they just tell each other lies,  and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date. --Martin,  age 10  What would you do if a date was not working  out?    I'd run home and play dead.  --Craig, age     When is it okay to kiss someone?   When they're rich. --Pam,age 7   The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't  want to mess with that.   --Curt, age     The rules goes like this:  If you kiss someone,  then you should marry them and have kids with them.  It's the right thing  to do. --Howard, age 8  How would the world be different if people weren't  married?   There sure would be a lot of kids to explain,  wouldn't there?  --Kelvin, age 8   What is the right age to get married?    No age is good to get married at.

I don't want to be all  grossed out. --Theodore, age 8  How do you decide who to marry?   You got to find somebody who likes the same  stuff.  Like if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports,  and she should keep the chips and dip coming.  --Alan, age 10  No person really decides before they grow up who  they're going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out  later who you're stuck with. --Kirsten, age 10  How can a stranger tell if two people are  married?

2022-04-19 07:25:02+00:00,true,5,"  Clay,  Per our call, I am giving below a brief account of what happened at site  yesterday:  At 02:33 hours on 9th April 2001, a failure occurred while both the 32 inch  lines were under pneumatic testing. The pressure at the time was 23.8 BARg; ultimate test pressure planned was  25.2 BARg. The event appears to have occurred between bent 4 and bent 1 (at the seaward  end of the jetty). No personnel were at risk; the planning and safety procedures were being  observed. A total of thirty personnel were on duty, involved in the test at the time of  occurrence and well away from the point of failure; an exclusion zone of 850  metres was in effect as planned.  Initial Assessment: Extensive impact bents 4 to 1; all pipework supports and plinths in this area  are a loss.  No visual evidence of impact  to unloading arms, or control building at the  jetty head. No immediate evidence of impact on jetty superstructure. Internal inspection of pipelines from point of failure to shore is underway.  Actions taken: Response team assigned. Insurance assessors notified and due to reach site today. Design and certain vendor assessments initiated. Assessment of jetty structure initiated; detailed check of all facilities  beyond the jetty to be conducted.  Most of the above is based on what Lingtec (the LNG Construction Contractor)  has reported to DPC.  Please appreciate that these reports are preliminary.   Lingtec is expected to make a detailed update during this week.  Should you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to call me.

There are four issues I have with this transaction:  1) As of 12/31/00, Co. 214 still has an Investment in Subsidiary balance of $1,760,000 and Equity Earnings of $494,508.83 relating to Co. 218. Should not these balances be $0? Also would there have been an intercompany gain/loss associated with this stock sale?   2) As of 12/31/00, Co. 102 shows no Investment in Subsidiary nor Equity Earnings balance relating to Co. 218. Should not there be a balance for Co. 218 which equals the USD equivalent of $8,000,000 Venezuelan Bolivars? Also, should not the Equity Earnings ($494,508.83) from Co. 218 posted on Co. 214 be posted on Co. 102?  3) As of 12/31/00, Co. 218 shows capital stock of $1,760,000 owned by Co. 214. Should not this capital stock be shown to be owned by Co. 102?  4) As of 12/31/00, Co. 214 is showing a $6,000,000 entry in ""Other Deductions"" (The credit side of the journal entry hits ""Deferred Credits."").  I need more detail concerning this amount. Could this be the consideration received from Co. 102 relating to the stock sale mentioned above?  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.  Thank you for your time, Khrissy Griffin 713-345-6039   ","Hello, I am a Tax Analyst currently working on Co. 102's (The Protane Corporation) and Co. 214's (Citadel Corporation Limited) federal tax returns.

2022-04-19 12:37:21+00:00,true,5,"  I have an opening at Capp St. Gallery at CCAC April 19 6 p.m.-9pm called PLOB  PLOB is an enclosed environment created out of hundreds of identical plastic translucent modules. Each module has a light and single different sound that are activated from movement.  Plastic Blob is a plob - A plob is the state between liquid plastic and solid material object. A Plob is a noun, but is also a verb. I plob in a state of endlessness. Capp Gallery is turned into a non-stop amorphous plastic scape that denotes a world with no boundaries - The space extends itself via plastic organic modules of repetition d a continuum of surface based on a conventional Cartesian grid. Plob is a metaphor for a continuous world, a neutral landscape, and an undulating surface that is reconfigurable and sizable ad infinitum.  The lightweight plastic moldings are rearrangeable abstractions that are a growth from the floor, walls, and ceiling - an extension of the natural landscape to the artificial landscape. All the notions of objects as singular are dispelled and are replaced by an environment rising out of the ground. The continuous white field is surrounded by field of fluorescence to allude to the world of technology, to digital space and arbiters, as a recluse from infotrophy.  Inevitably our entire physical landscape will merge and connect. Furniture and space merge, Object and environment, City and town, water and ground, highway to highway, being to being.  Please come.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new  building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being  offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.  This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the  new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The  cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is  currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly  employee cost of $94.00.  If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to  the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made  as spaces become available.   The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be  opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street  level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available.  Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an  exit in the event of elevator trouble.   If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to  Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision.

2022-04-19 22:04:52+00:00,true,5,"  If the last Hoegh Galleon cargo of this year is diverted to Puerto Rico, the  economics of sending non-Cabot LNG to Puerto Rico are different than those  mentioned in my prior note.  Based on current prices, there is $0.7 MM of value that could be captured  between Enron LNG and Eco on the diversion. This represents the price  difference between what it would cost to buy back our sale to ENA at CMS and  what Eco would have had to pay Cabot for a Winter Cargo. If CMS would let us  out of the terminal fee or let it apply to a future delivery, that would add  an additional $1 MM of value. If Cabot had to give up its Demand Charge and  Demand Surcharge (hard to imagine) on the Winter Cargo, that adds another  $4.7 MM.  A second Hoegh Galleon cargo should add $1.5 MM but would need to be sourced  from Nigeria or Algeria(???).   Cabot controls the date of the Last Cargo delivered in 2001. It can be  November 23-December 15 (unless another date is mutually agreeable). The date  of this last delivery determines the earliest date that Eco would be able to  receive the Hoegh Galleon. The earliest that Eco could receive the Hoegh  Galleon should therefore be between December 20 and January 11 - depends on  Cabot.   Eco would be able to receive a second Hoegh Galleon cargo as soon as 29 days  after the first Hoegh Galleon cargo delivery or as late as 45 days after. Two  Hoegh Galleon cargoes should give Eco enough fuel (barely) to get them to the  dates where they are eligible to receive the Early Spring cargo (100 days  after the Last Cargo of 2001).   In addition to the $$$'s available to be captured, this program removes Eco's  risk of not receiving a Winter Cargo from Cabot.  Economics and Timing -  The amount of value to be captured is most heavily  influenced by December-January NYMEX prices. These impact our cost to buy  back gas at the CMS tailgate and our cost to buy the second Hoegh Galleon  cargo. Our gas cost is more subject to change than is the Cabot contract  price we are trying to beat. If we had a crystal ball, we would lock-in the  economics of the diversion and of the purchase of the second cargo when the  NYMEX bottoms-out. The front of the price curve has lost ~$1.00/MMBtu in the  last 2 weeks. Where will it go from here?  In order to be prepared to execute when market conditions are right, we need  to get Eco on board and initiate discussions with a producer about supply for  the second cargo. Also, we should talk with Gene Massey to confirm that the  contract says what we think it says and to get his thoughts on what we are  trying to do.  I would appreciate any insights that you may have regarding this opportunity.

2022-04-19 22:12:08+00:00,true,5,"  John,  You are correct, when you compute the historical volatility you need to use  252 days to annualize the volatility. This is because the historical data only existed for trading days.   The common practice here at Enron for computing Time to maturity is Calendar  Days (= Maturity date - valuation date). Therefore the days in Year is 365.25.  So the implied volatility from the  EIMPVOL function uses 365.25 days as one year.  If you want to convert you can apply the following formula  historical vol * sqrt(252)    vs.  implied vol * sqrt(365.25).  Let me know if this helps.   Zimin         John Griffith@ENRON 05/03/2001 03:31 PM To: Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Paulo Issler/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, John  Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike Maggi/Corp/Enron@Enron  Subject: Historical Volatility  Zimin,  I have a question about historical volatility.  The way I have been  calculating historical volatility is that I take the standard deviation of  the log returns of the price settles.  I then take that number (daily  volatility) and multiply by the square root of the number of trading days to  come up with an annualized volatility.  The number of trading days that I  have been using is 252, however I do not know if this is correct.  What I am  trying to do is calculate a historical volatility that would be comparable to  the implied volatility that we are calculating our books with.  The implied  volatilities are iterated using the euro function.  I get a straddle quote  and I iterate what volatility would be used to come up with that price ( I  also look at the eimvol function).  I know that we use a 365.25 trading day  convention in pricing our options, does this mean that to come up with a  comparable historical volatility number I need to use 365.25 to convert the  daily historical volatility to an annualized volatility?

2022-04-19 11:56:17+00:00,true,5,"    John,   For a down and out put, I put the following as an approximation for our understanding purpose.  a down and out put with barrier B < strike K is overestimated by  A put at struck at K - a put struck at B - (K-B)*digital put strike at B.  I ploted the barrier put (blue line)  versus the approximation (red line) as function of the  barrier.    The true barrier option has zero payoff whenever there is a touch down the barrier during the lifetime of the option.  Therefore it goes to zero much faster than above approximation when B -> K.  See the spreadsheet for more details.

The pressure at the time was 23.8 BARg; ultimate test pressure planned was 25.2 BARg. The event appears to have occurred between bent 4 and bent 1 (at the seaward end of the jetty). No personnel were at risk; the planning and safety procedures were being observed. A total of thirty personnel were on duty, involved in the test at the time of occurrence and well away from the point of failure; an exclusion zone of 850 metres was in effect as planned.  Initial Assessment: Extensive impact bents 4 to 1; all pipework supports and plinths in this area are a loss.  No visual evidence of impact  to unloading arms, or control building at the jetty head. No immediate evidence of impact on jetty superstructure. Internal inspection of pipelines from point of failure to shore is underway.  Actions taken: Response team assigned. Insurance assessors notified and due to reach site today. Design and certain vendor assessments initiated. Assessment of jetty structure initiated; detailed check of all facilities beyond the jetty to be conducted.  Most of the above is based on what Lingtec (the LNG Construction Contractor) has reported to DPC.  Please appreciate that these reports are preliminary.

2022-04-19 08:16:18+00:00,true,5,"  Attached are my notes from the Meeting with SLNG, BG, and EPME on the Elba Island LNG Terminal Reactivation , held at the Terminal site in Savannah on April 3 and 4, 2001.     The significant issues are summarized as follows:  The ELP Report indicates that two 50 tonne tractor tugs and one 30 tonne standard tug are required to dock a ship at Elba Island.  For the Dabhol project, an Enron commissioned study indicates that four 50 tonne tractor tugs are required during high wind conditions (25 knots) to safely berth a Lakshmi type vessel.  Each shipper will have to make its own determination as to whether or not additional tugs over what the ELP study recommends are necessary at Elba Island. SLNG are to prepare a table comparing their current turning basin cost assessment with the alternate arrangement discussed in the meeting. Enron are not convinced that the new Turning Basin is necessary to protect LNG tankers moored to the dock from the wake of passing ships and requested additional simulation by Eagle, Lyon, Pope(ELP) to evaluate the impact of ships passing at a distance of 500 ft on a 135,000 m3 vessel moored at the dock with 16 lines.   There is a potential annual savings of $2 million+ for maintenance costs, if the Army Corp of Engineers does the maintenance dredging for the new turning basin, which they have apparently verbally committed to do.  This maintenance cost savings, if realized, would offset the $10 million+ capital cost for the new turning basin. Neither Enron nor BG support the use of tugs to escort vessels past the Elba Island Dock when no LNG ship is berthed at the dock.   SLNG are to request a meeting with FERC (Bob Arvedlund), tenatively 24 April 2001,  to present the results of the Eagle Lyon Pope Marine Navigation Study and argue that tug escorts when an LNG Tanker is not moored to the dock is unnecessary.  Reps from Enron, BG, EPME and SLNG will be invited. There is a possiblity that the Army Corp of Engineers will not approve the new turning basin in time for SLNG's scheduled reopening date.  If this happens, then the proposed arguments to FERC regarding dock protection will have to be reassessed. The US Coast Guard Draft report on Notice of Proposed Rule Making for Savannah River traffic and LNG vessels should be issued within two weeks.  Interested parties will then have 60 days to file comments. SLNG are to provide drawings of the new LNG unloading dock to both Enron and BG. SLNG are to provide monthly cost updates to both Enron and BG.  BG stressed that they will not need the terminal to be reactivated until April/May 2002, and that there is no justification for spending money to accelerate the reactivation schedule to acheive SLNG's 1 October 2002 reactivation date.  SLNG are to provide Enron and BG a copy of the Savannah Pilots Association working procedures for river traffic.

2022-04-19 13:54:23+00:00,true,5,"  Note:  It is not too early to be thinking about the possibilty of buying a replacement Winter LNG cargo for the Eco project (see Article 12.3 (b) (iv) of the Cabot contract). My interpretation of the contract is that you avoid the Commodity Charge, Commodity Surcharge, Demand Charge, and Demand Surcharge on one Standard Cargo if Cabot cannot commit to Delivery of the Winter Cargo. For 2002, these add up to over $7.00/MMBtu based on current estimates of how 2001 prices will settle. December/January Nymex prices are ~$5.60/MMBtu. I believe that should mean that Puerto Rico should be able to land a cargo at near $5.00.   We can discuss the hedges you would need to put in place to secure the benefit of buying the replacement cargo.

Along with upgrading the O/S, Enron has also took the initiative to move over  to Microsoft Outlook2000, for our messaging client.  This will provide more  flexibility and ease-of-use for e-mail, calendars, contacts -- not to mention  an easier medium to synchronize data to your handheld devices.   I would like to start the migration process first with visiting with each of  you, going thru a 'profile process' that should last no more than 10-15min.   Profiling can begin as early as tomorrow (4/17/01) - so here is what I ask of  you:   *** Please reply to this e-mail with a date/time that I can stop by.  Being  that most of you sit in the same, general location - I'm hoping this  profiling process should take no more than a few days. ***   Feel free to e-mail/call me should you have any questions or any specific  concerns with this process, as we strive to ensure the migration from WinNT  to Win2K is a smooth, efficient one.

I need the following four issues resolved to complete their tax returns. If you are not the correct accountant(s), could you please tell me who is? I would appreciate this information by Friday, April 27.  It appears that on November 3, 2000 Co. 214 sold its 100% interest in Co. 218 (Citadel Venezolana, S.A.) to Co. 102 for 8,000,000 Venezuelan Bolivars.

Should not these balances be $0? Also would there have been an intercompany gain/loss associated with this stock sale?   2) As of 12/31/00, Co. 102 shows no Investment in Subsidiary nor Equity Earnings balance relating to Co. 218. Should not there be a balance for Co. 218 which equals the USD equivalent of $8,000,000 Venezuelan Bolivars? Also, should not the Equity Earnings ($494,508.83) from Co. 218 posted on Co. 214 be posted on Co. 102?  3) As of 12/31/00, Co. 218 shows capital stock of $1,760,000 owned by Co. 214. Should not this capital stock be shown to be owned by Co. 102?  4) As of 12/31/00, Co. 214 is showing a $6,000,000 entry in ""Other Deductions"" (The credit side of the journal entry hits ""Deferred Credits."").  I need more detail concerning this amount. Could this be the consideration received from Co. 102 relating to the stock sale mentioned above?

Let's stay in touch about the possibilty of landing a spot cargo into Puerto Rico in January. As we discussed, how we play this with Cabot is a big issue. There could be an additional $4.7 MM of value that could be captured by Eco if Cabot were unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo. Also, let's continue to think about how we make the logistics work and how we can get Cabot's cooperation if needed.

We could arrive Sunday  see Corcovado, P?o de A?ucar, Tijuca rainforrest, and a few outlying beaches.  Then late Tuesday afternoon the 10th you and Renato could fly out for Foz.  Depending on the flight schedules you may have to wait until early Wednesday morning the 11th. I think that Tuesday would be better so you're not feeling rushed, but we'll see what flight times are offered.  Spend two nights at Foz and fly into SP late Thursday evening the 12th.  Hang around the house on Friday, put your suitcases together and head back for Houston that evening.     Too bad you're not able to spend more time here, but given what time you have I think you'll be seeing the two most interesting places in Brazil. All of the others, Amazon, Pantanal, Bahia all take so much travel time to get there that it's not even really worth the attempt to see them.   If you do decide on Foz, don't mess with packing your coats, it'll be easier to borrow some of ours.     The travel agent is looking at fares, etc. so I'll let you know what she finds. I'll be in touch.............Jan        ","Thanks for your help, Jan. Renato just got home late last night. I'll have to inform him of our travel plans!!

We are sorry to say that the vessel need abt 48 hrs to carry out the necessary work on the steam plant in order to minimize the steam leakage and having service on the steam maneuvre control valve.    As you know, we need some hrs to cool down the boilers/steam valve/pipes before it is possible  to open and to work with, after both boilers are been shut down. To cooldown the steam plant take abt 10-12 hrs and to bring the plant into service again can take abt 6 hrs, so that means that we need 48 hrs, as mentioned above, to get our maintenace plan carried out.  According to the obervations done, last on the stopp last night, were the valve operated without any problems, we believe that the valve can be fixed without totaly dismantling. On the other hand,if the valve has to be completely dismanteled, the work can take more than the expected 2 days. We believe that the chance of this situation is slim.

2022-04-19 04:32:55+00:00,true,6,"  Dear Tim,  Thank you for your feedback.  The weekly meetings are going well.  We're actually meeting every other week and I am providing DPR impact reports and feedback to the traders on a weekly basis.  I find that meeting every other Wednesday gives me a chance to monitor trends per each desk and gives me time to collect information about settlements issues, such as new fees and or ancillary charges that affect the short-term desks.  (For example, please see summary of newly-imposed Nevada Power transmission fees and e-mail from Amy Clemons regarding the APS/Pinnacle West EOL purchases that were provided in yesterday's reports.)  I am getting excellent feedback and response time from the traders.  Cara has been extremely helpful in providing feedback on issues that pertain tot he ST NW and ST SW desks, and Jesse has been a very valuable resource in the real-time desk.    Below is a summary of what we spoke about in yesterday's meeting:  Real-Time: Getting better; no apparent trends.  There were 25 new disputes this past week that were real-time related. I have had to pull 8 tapes in the past month.  Of the 8, we were correct twice (25% of the time) and the counterparty was correct 6 times (75% of the time).  If better notes had been kept, we could have avoided the tape-pulling process.   Real Time will be affected by the new NPC transmission ancillary charges when NPC tranny is purchased real-time. DPR impact: Overall positive DPR impact for the month of March ($1,101,755.20) has decreased by  $18,350.00 due to disputes that were settled not in our favor.  (Common negative impacts are a result of: a lower sell-to price than what was originally recorded in EnPower, a higher buy-from price than was originally recorded in EnPower, the addition of transmission to a deal that had been left out of EnPower, and over-purchasing of transmission or power.)    Services:  I'm still seeing too many deals that are not being recorded in EnPower, though they may be in the trader's log.   Many of these deals go unrecorded in the Dispute Management System (DMS), as Caroline and Virginia do weekly checkouts with these counterparties to catch problems before the month-end.  DPR Impact: The most common problem comes from Real-time not recording each deal in EnPower.  The DPR impact is typically positive when this happens because when both sides of the deal are entered, EPMI nets between $1 - $5 per megawatt hour.  ST NW: No trends.  We have some transmission cleanup from November that has come back. The NW will not be affected by the new NPC transmission charges. DPR Impact: This week's disputes, yet still unsettled, create a negative $ 9,605.75 impact.  These disputes have been re-opened for the month of November 2000.  This year's to-date DPR impact has been minimal (approx. $900) and has been mainly due to month-end annuities for ancillary charges.  ST SW:  Only trend: counterparty name changes from APS to Pinnacle West.  No DPR impact on name changes. The southwest desk will be affected by the new NPC transmission ancillary charges, as this desk reserves Nevada Power transmission.  The southwest desk will also be subject to the APS/Pinnacle West name change for all EOL deals as of 3/10/01. DPR impact:  This year to date, there is a positive $82,361.57 impact that is due mainly to a credit annuity for overpaid transmission.  Any negative impacts are due to month-end annuities for ancillary charges and are under $5000.00.  ST CA:  All bilateral disputes have come from EES.   DPR impact: The large positive DPR impact over the last month is the result of two EES deals that had not been added to the system.    In addition, I am working with the DMS computer team in Houston designing reports that will give the following information:  date dispute was entered into system vs. date dispute was closed date dispute was presented to trader vs. when the trader responded patterns on each desk or trends that can be addressed trader's name who is responsible for the hour that is in question during a dispute when the dispute is resolved, how much actual time was put into it percentage of how often we are correct vs. how often the counterparty is correct  who is responsible for the labor that went into the dispute (counterparty, EPMI trader) DPR impact per desk trend in number of disputes per month vs. prior year   I will provide you a preliminary design of what I would like these reports to look like in the first go-around.   Any feedback you can provide will be extremely helpful to me.    Thanks again,  Virginia ","Dear Tim, Thank you for your feedback. The weekly meetings are going well.

The Navy has really gotten even with me ever since I got married.  Those years during flight school where I had a bunch of time to goof off were awesome, but unfortunately over.  I guess they wait until a pilot has all of his qualifications and then they definitely get their money out of him.  It only makes sense.  I can't believe I'm finally on my deployment.  This has been a cloud hanging over my head for some time now.  I guess I'll be back soon enough.  We are in transit steaming out to the far east and just passed the Yucatan Peninsula, Cuba, and Jamaica.  Unfortunately, we did not get to stop in any of those places.  These e-mails could potentially be monitored because they are sent via satellite so I am unable to tell you where we are or where we are going, only where we've been.  I'll keep you posted.  The conditions on this ship are not too bad.  I've got a nice stateroom and everything I need for a cruise.... Except the ability to get off when I want to and see my wife.  I have not been flying too much lately, I've been standing a lot of watch though.   I guess they are letting the newer guys get some experience.  When you're in  the middle of the ocean standing watch at 3 am and its so dark that you can't see anything (not that you can see anything but water anyway) it's a pretty calming feeling.  You can see so many stars its unbelievable. There are no city lights to drown them out and its spectacular.  We have hit some rough seas and landing on the ship has been challenging, but good practice.  I've been pretty busy because I just took over a new division. I've got 60 young guys that are extremely hard workers but sometimes don't always use the best judgment. I'm sure I'll have some interesting stories when I get back.  Anyway, I just wanted to say hey and give you the scoop on me.  I hope to be a little bit better about keeping in touch out here. Please say hello to everyone for me and could you please send me Hatcher's e-mail address.  Also, if you could do me a favor and say hey to Cassey every once in a while, she's pretty lonely.

The code hasn't been fully tested yet, so completion of this part may be delayed until cob Monday.  I am finished with September Finals for the non-deviation stuff through the 28th, and will have the last two days done tomorrow morning.  I anticipate having all of September completely actualized (for both Preliminary and Final) by cob Tuesday.

2022-04-19 13:55:09+00:00,true,6,"  Denis:  I wanted to share a couple of thoughts with you as we bring our current agreement to a close.    First, I want to thank you and the others at Tosco for your business over the past couple years and for giving us the opportunity to be your Scheduling Coordinator.  You were our first generator client and this gave us a valuable mechanism to develop this business.  Secondly, we will work to resolve any outstanding billing issues.  Please use me as a contact if Kourtney is not available.  We expect that very shortly, we will have some ISO ""true-ups,"" coming through and a final reconciliation for December.  Thirdly, I believe that overall we have done a good job for Tosco and our performance does not warrant our being ""fired"" as your SC.  We have all tried very hard to give you good service.  Our prices have always been more than fair to Tosco, resulting in very little, if any, profit to Enron.  I think we could have resolved the issues that concern you  but obviously you are entitled to your opinions.  With respect to service, settlements, pricing, etc. I am confident that once you start with your new SC, you will soon learn that Enron maybe wasn't so bad afterall!    Lastly, I hope that it is OK that we continue to compete for your business.  I know you have Enronline so I take a cerain amount of satisfaction in knowing that you will be holding your new SC to that standard.   Now that we have been through circumstances that are so difficult I believe we could reach agreement on new terms that would result in Tosco getting the best deal it can get in the marketplace.  Let me know if there is ever an opportunity in the future to compete for your business, particularly once we start quoting purchases against the Dow Jones index  Let me know if you have any final comments and once again thanks for your business.  Sincerely,  Chris","Denis: I want to share a couple of thoughts with you as we bring our current agreement to a close.

2022-04-19 17:14:50+00:00,true,6,"  A friend has sent you a Q&A from Ask Dr. Weil (http://www.drweil.com).  Reply to your friend at williamsj@iconus.com  Read this... especially the paragraph about allergies.  You need to make an appt. with an ENT - soon.  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  <font size=-1>(Published 2/21/97)</font> Well, I have to say yes and no. Beano is a plant enzyme that helps your body digest some sugars that the body can't process. Usually these are broken down by bacteria in the gut, resulting in the formation of methane, which is to say, <A HREF=""http://www.medicinenet.com/mainmenu/encyclop/ARTICLE/ART_G/gas.htm"" TARGET=""_new"">gas</A>.   <p>You have to take a few drops of Beano with the first bite of the food that causes the problem. Some people will tell you that it works great, and others will tell you that it doesn't work at all. I'd say it works somewhat.   <p>The difference in effects may be related to the different reasons why people get gas. Many people <A HREF=""http://www.tv.cbc.ca/healthshow/pastitem/1997/lactose.html"" TARGET=""_new"">can't digest milk</A> because they lack a necessary enzyme, called lactase, for breaking down milk sugar. For them, Lactaid or Dairy Ease may prove more useful. Beano does not break down lactose, but!  does handle stachyose and raffinose, two of the problematic sugars in beans.  <p>Others get gas because they swallow a lot of air while they're eating. This can become a problem if you have a cold, or if you have allergies or a sinus condition and tend to breathe through your mouth. My advice: Take smaller bites and notice when you're breathing.   <p>If Beano doesn't work for you, you can try other natural preventive measures against gas. Some people swear by <A HREF=""http://www.frontierherb.com/spices/kkl/kkl.notes.anise.seed.html"" TARGET=""_new"">anise</A> or fennel seeds, which are gastric stimulants. <A HREF=""http://essentialgarden.com/news/hblurb/sect/001_001_10_001.html"" TARGET=""_new"">Acidophilus</A> will keep your intestine in healthy working order. Papaya enzyme just after a meal may also help.   <p>Other strategies would be to select beans that are naturally low in the difficult sugars. The best are Anasazi beans, a mutant variety of pinto beans that look much pretti! er. Black beans are also very good. Some of the worst offenders are pea beans and navy beans.   <p>You can also ease the problem somewhat by soaking the beans overnight, then throwing away the water and replacing it with fresh water for cooking. People who eat beans regularly are less likely to have problems. So rather than staying away from these extremely nutritious foods, go for it. And certainly give Beano a try.

2022-04-19 22:18:07+00:00,true,6,"    This one is pretty good!  Hope everyone is doing well!    This is unbelievable!  Read the story first.....then look at the picture.  Rodger Degagne a former employee with AECL in Chalk River may be embarking on a new career as Feline breeder.  Relaxing in his spacious home on the shores of the Ottawa River, Mr. Degagne recalls how 15 years ago he befriended two stray young cats on the old AECL research facility at Chalk River.  The kittens had appeared in late summer and apparently had gotten under a security fence around the old labs abandoned since the late 50s.  With the help of his tuna sandwich, Mr. Degagne was able to coax the kitties close enough so that he could pick them up.  A self-described animal lover, he did not want to place the kittens in the local Humane Society.  In this largely rural area, cats of all stripes and age largely go unwanted and are humanely disposed of after a few days.  Later that evening, his wife Louise and their two children, Nicole and Kelly came to a family decision to keep the kittens which they named Lost and Found.  Lost turned out to be female and Found a male.  When nature finally took its course, a litter of kittens was born six years later.  One of the litter was a big white female with a unique black markings on her side and tail.  Something about the kitten captured the hearts of the family and while her siblings eventually found homes elsewhere.  Snowball stayed with the Degagnes.  While Lost and Found are no longer with us, their progeny live on. In her nine years Snowball's size has seemed to snowball.  Put simply, Snowball is no ordinary cat; she measures 69 inches from nose to tail and weighs in at 87 lbs. ""She started out a big kitty and she just seemed to keep growing.  She always meowed for more food, and would climb up on the counter to eat food which I forgot to cover.  Chicken is her favorite.  Once I left a cooked chicken on the table that I was going to use for a boat picnic; an hour later, the chicken was gone,"" Louise said.  ""We knew that Snowball wasn't your average cat when the neighbors' German Shepherd ran yelping away from his first encounter with her.  She just isn't afraid of any animals.  After we found a half-eaten raccoon out by the garage, we decided that maybe Snowball should be kept fenced in.  We soon discovered that while we can keep Snowball in the yard, we couldn't keep raccoons from Snowball.  ""At least it kept the food bills down,"" Rodger laughed. ""Like all female cats, she is very territorial, but with us she is just a big ol' kitten,"" he said.  So what does an 87-lb. cat eat?  ""Snowball goes through about three lbs. of cat food a day, along with cooked chicken , supplemented with deer and moose that Rodger hunts in the fall.  She likes pike a lot, so I don't throw them back anymore.""  Snowball often accompanies Rodger fishing on the Ottawa, eagerly peering over the side of the boat as soon as his line goes tight.  So to what do the Degagnes attribute Snowball's size?  Rodger says, ""Well, the vet thinks it could be her thyroid, but she isn't fat; she's just a real big cat.  I think maybe her parents got into something at Chalk River that they shouldn't have.""      - snowball.jpg          *******************Internet Email Confidentiality Footer*******************   Privileged/Confidential Information may be contained in this message.

If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.           As far as recommendations, here is a short list:   1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future        replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.                     This creates a shortage in later months.   2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.                         Specific questions should include:      1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage?    2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system.          I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less.   3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                      LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market and the       consumer has benefitted.

2022-04-19 11:28:38+00:00,true,6,"  Andrew,  As discussed numerous times in the past, the Volume Management terminal server utilization / demands change frequently.  The Volume Management team has been directed by the application development group to re-run all of the reconciliation tools for September-00 through January-01.  For some reason when running this tool over the past two week the tool is taking exceptionally long.  It used to take 20 - 30 min to run for one day.  It has been known to take up to 2 hours during the last couple of weeks to complete one day.  On the average when we have to re-run for a month we don't run it day by day.  However, the amount of time required is still in excess of 2 or 3 hr window provided.  These job will take anywhere from 6 to 10 hr for an entire month.   The dollar amounts associated with the settlements which need to be recalculated and distributed are in excess of $70 mil.  and our customers are growing inpatient in receiving their money.  Please remove the terminal server restriction on at least one of the terminal servers through 4/27/01.  If all goes well we should be successful in completing our efforts by then.  In the future when contacted by Dave Steiner with a request like this it, would be appreciated if you would take action without requesting a email from me.  We discussed with Dave what was needed and I see where someone in Houston made the decision that this was not an emergency.  Until that individual knows what is happening in our office on a real-time basis (Like Dave Does), I feel they should let the West Power Desk make that decision.

I also have provided explanations for the differences between the two.   Please call me this morning (before 9 or after 10, please) if you need to discuss this further.

2022-04-19 13:07:19+00:00,true,6,"  Pamela,  Where do you get the numbers for the EEMC tab? Here are the stages of the process that I currently know about:     1) EES sends the schedule  file to the EPMI server   2) Calf. schedulers pull EES schedules into their portfolio and submit the information to the ISO.   3) ISO sends back Day Ahead Finals (Changes could occur with EES original schedule)   4) ISO Sends back Hour Ahead Finals (Changes could occur with EES schedule from the Day Ahead Market)   As you can see, there is quite a few places that changes can occur to an EES schedule in the course of a day. So I am trying to follow the information flow on both the EES side and the EPMI side. If the only schedule you see is the one that is originally sent to the  EPMI server, then I can see where we have the potential to have many unexplained variances. If this is the case, this may be nothing more than providing you with the incremental information that is provided by the ISO during the course of a given day. Just update me on your process flow, and I will keep this issue moving along until completion.          Thanks           Chris     To: Chris Stokley/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: HA Final Schedules for EES & PGES for 03/26 - 0403     Chris,  the spreadsheet below contains the HA_Finals that you send to me(EPMI) as well as the scheduled volumes sent from the scheduling group(EES).  The volumes on the EPMI tab is inconsistent with the EEMC tab.  Please review the variance sheet tab which will denote the days, zone and hours where the difference occur.    I am assuming the EPMI numbers are incorrect because of the hour by hour consistency on the EEMC  spreadsheet.  However,  this assumption could be incorrect.   Again, please review and let me know.
