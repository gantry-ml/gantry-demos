With increased wildfires in the West, moving flocks safely through mountains is getting more difficult. Shepherds are on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, for two-and-a-half-year stints. Their main duties include moving their flock to fresh grazing grounds, protecting sheep from predators, and making sure none is lost. Each shepherd is responsible for flocks of about a thousand sheep.

Repost from @thevirginiamermaid  ""The Song of the Sea"" film has captured my imagination since its release in 2014.🌬 The whimsical animation inspired not just the glow in the dark patterning on the back my personal silicone tail and my one and only tattoo but has now been personified in an entire @finfolkproductions fabric tail. The earthy tones and ocean wave patterning on this tail evoke the spirit of Saoirse the selkie and I jumped at the opportunity to create a mermaid mashup.🧜‍♀️ Selkies are often depicted as having a darker complexion with wild black hair and black seal-like eyes, sometimes with mottled seal coats but often in stories as well as the Song of the Sea as having abnormal pure white coats. 🦭 I bought this white faux fur vest from a thrift store last winter for an eventual project and it happened to make the perfect white Song of the Sea seal skin 🦭 . .

2022-04-23 14:10:57+00:00,true,1,"   Matt:  Here is where we stand with the Centrans arrangement.  1.  I have spoken to Daniel R. Castagnola, a VP in Finance who has worked with the Centrans and speaks highly of their business acumen in Central America.  The transactions Enron has done with Centrans to date involve equity transactions whereby any Enron credit exposure was hedged by assets.  So, the financial strength of Centrans was not directly in question.  Daniel indicated that we should look at Centrans independently to establish a transaction in Baja.  To this end, we need financial statements from Centrans to establish credit parameters and prepare a Master Power purchase Agreement.    2.  Stewart Rosman has made a few calls to CFE re: transmission access in Mexico.  CFE has indicated that transmission is available.  We have never purchased transmission in Mexico and although it might be possible to do so, we would prefer if Centrans did it themselves and get the power into the ISO at Tijuana, which is an ISO tie-point.  I would expect transmission on this arrangement is probably worth $5 or so.     3.  Forward Prices - As you know, the longer term price at SP-15 for Peak is about $36 - $37.  Off peak is about $10 lower.  This nets about $30 to the project in Baja.  I am not sure what fuel price to use, but it seems unlikely that project economics would be supported by such a price. My recommendation would be to proceed with the credit review and set up contracts with Centrans.  This would require obtaining financial statements from them.  Let me know if you want me to speak with them or if you are going to handle it. Thanks  C  Chris Foster chris.h.foster@enron.com (W) 503/464-3822 (Cell) 503/702-8568","Matt: Here is where we stand with the Centrans arrangement. 1. I have spoken to Daniel R.

I have spoken to Daniel R. Castagnola, a VP in Finance who has worked with Centrans and speaks highly of your business acumen in Central America.  The transactions Enron has done with Centrans to date involve equity transactions whereby any Enron credit exposure was hedged by assets.  So, the financial strength of Centrans was not directly in question.  Daniel indicated that we should look at Centrans independently to establish a transaction in Baja.  To this end, we need financial statements from Centrans to establish credit parameters and prepare a Master Power purchase Agreement that could be used to conduct business.    2.  Stewart Rosman has contacted CFE re: transmission access in Baja.  CFE has indicated that transmission is available.  We have never purchased transmission in Mexico and although it might be possible to do so, we would prefer if Centrans contracted for it themselves, delivering energy to Enron into the ISO grid at Tijuana, which is an ISO tie-point.  I would expect transmission on this arrangement would cost about $5/MWh.     3.  Forward Prices - As you know, the longer term price at SP-15 for Peak is about $36.  Off peak is about $24.  After subtracting the cost of transmission, this nets about $30 for peak energy and $19 for off peak to the project in Baja.  I am not sure what your fuel price would be, but it seems unlikely that project economics would be supported by such a price. Please contact me and let me know if you want to continue efforts to proceed with this project.  If so, we need to obtain your financial statements to proceed with the credit review and set up contracts with Centrans.   Thanks  Chris Foster chris.h.foster@enron.com (W) 503/464-3822 (Cell) 503/702-8568","Lorenzo: I apologize for our tardiness in getting back to you re: your generation project in Baja.

Answer: Old Tom was a popular style of gin in 18th century England. At that time, gin was sold under the table due to a prohibition law. Bootleggers devised a clever system to sell gin on the sly, though. Locals gathered underneath a bar sign in the shape of a cat. They called the cat Old Tom. Hidden underneath his paw was a small slot into which they could insert their money, and the barman would in return pour out a serving of gin through a pipe.  . . .

Yes, one of our main objective at Tèrra is raising awareness on respect nature, inspiring others in taking daily actions for saving our planet. From little things. 💚  Here a list of what we do to be a sustainable and zero food waste restaurant and hopefully would inspire you to take little actions:  1. Choose seasonal, local and possibly from regenerative farming or biodynamic;   2. Buy what you need. As restaurant, we rely on bookings and therefore it’s pretty easy to follow up;  3. ♻️Use every ingredient and its scraps into a creative way. We at tèrra create by-products from leftovers.  4. Reduce the amount of plastic. At tèrra we have drastically reduced / almost eliminate single portion plastic (sous vide cooking) and plastic film. We instead us reusable boxes.  5. Save water. We have a filtered system which makes still or sparking water and we refill jars for our guests. In case if surplus we water plants 🌱  6.Reuse coffe grounds. ♻️We have been making kombucha, cookies or just donated as compost for our kitchen garden!  7. Kitchen garden. We have aromatic herbs and flowers we use for plating. We only take what we need.  8. Reuse kitchen scraps. ♻️Most of the food is usually thrown away has actually a lot of potentials. Indeed, at tèrra before throwing it away, we use it in several ways to avoid waste; key words is creativity!  9. Follow the Mediterranean diet, which is rooted in our chef mindset, based on vegetables and fruit, cereals, legumes and on top (which are the lowest amount) fish and meat. Inclusivity and respect for intolerances is also a must.  10. Respect of people. Ourselves, our staff, our stakeholders and active parts of the chain, our guests. If we can respect ourself and others then we can respect also our Mother Earth.🍀  Of course the order of the list is not intended as priority. That’s in really short our approach to a sustainable and conscious living & eating.   Discover Tèrra. 🍀 Chef @valerio_serino  A project by @valerio_serino & @__lucy_in_the_sky__","9.
