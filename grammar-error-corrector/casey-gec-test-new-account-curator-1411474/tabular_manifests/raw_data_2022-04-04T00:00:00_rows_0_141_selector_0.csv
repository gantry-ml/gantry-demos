2022-04-04 01:17:04+00:00,true,3,"  Sara:  I just spoke with Rolo and he advised the ownership structure of  Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A. (TGS):  70% of TGS is owned by Compania de Inversiones de Energia S.A. (CIESA) CIESA is owned 50% by Enron and 50% by Perez Companc.

The ownership structure of CIESA is somewhat complex and it appears that  Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A. is the legal entity that owns the  shares in CIESA.

2022-04-04 02:01:09+00:00,true,3,"  Andrea,  Based on discussions with D'Arcy on the commercial terms of the proposal we  want to offer to Champion, I've made a few changes to the attachment of the  Champion draft contract that I would like you to take a look at (sorry Brent,  but they are in Portuguese in the interest of getting this deal done ASAP).  The basics are as follows:  If Champion has a Load Factor above 91%:  They pay a final price that could be a max of R$ 42.72/MWh or a min of R$  40/MWh.  The final price will be determined based on an indexation formula  that will dictate the exact fluctuation [D'Arcy, I think we should have a  more final formula to include so please review it].  If Champion has a Load Factor equal or below 91%:  They pay a demand charge of R$ 3.16/kW (assuming the contracted demand is  3000 kW), and R$ 40.28/MWh that they consume.  To be honest this doesn't give  us any real protection on the demand charge side, but it's consistent with a  previous agreement with Elektro.  Ideally I would like to see Champion  committ to a min take or pay of say 50% of the energy.  We need further  confirmation on these numbers from Luiz Ot?vio and Baccaro (the idea was to  use the same numbers of the Elektro contract, but assuming the increase that  you got).  The idea is to make this contract a little simpler than what D'Arcy had in  mind initially in the interest of getting the deal done by the end of this  month (we need verbal confirmation tomorrow though to inform volumes to the  MAE).  Please send your comments asap.

When the deal was described to me it sounded like we were buying a floor and  that we would imbed the floor into the physical power deal.  After looking at  the structure you sent it looks like they are the ones buying the floor.   They are getting paid (by virtue of the reduced cost of energy) if the spot  goes below the strike.   now i'm confused (!) - Champion will benefit from a fall in paper prices  through a reduction in the cost of their energy, limited to a minimum of R$40  with an original and maximum price of R$42.75; defer to you for advice on how  to best structure this i.e., theoretically, both Champion and Enron S.A.  are  ""buying"" puts, floor (Champion from ECE and ECE from Enron N.A.) -  but, yes  absolutely no question, ECE would prefer to imbed the product in its energy  sale, so that Champion only sees floating price with possible adjustments to  the downside  Based on your email this is how I think the deal would be structured.  We supply on a firm basis 3MW of energy for three months.  They pay a floating price for the energy based on the following formula: R$42.75 minus an amount, if positive, equal to [factor] multiplied by the  difference between [a strike price in R$] and the Spot Price.  The Spot Price  will be in R$ per pound of a paper product quoted in R$ [which is to be  defined]. (I did not understand your third bullet point very well.  The  relationship between the two indexes was unclear and contrary to your formula  it did not appear that these indexes were quoted in R$.  Please clarify these  issues for me.)   Formula: R$42.75 * (Avg. (decrease) Index price - Spot or  Floor Price)/Spot or Floor Price  (Page 2 of proposal ""Tarifa"") eg adjusted  each month on the % decrease in the monthly index average Note: would like  prefer to set the Spot or Benchmark Price at outset.   The R$ versus Pounds/Metric Ton issues are very good points - defer to you, I  think, Brent/Andrea for preferred structure; in this case, Champion will I  think defer to us.  We can ask how they execute for their exports and  R$/Pounds exposure.   We will need to know where and when to pick up the spot price so that  everyone understands what published price will be used each month when the  price is determined.  The [factor] will be something you will need to come up  with to correlate the volumes you are hedging with the amount of electricity  actually sold.  We will also need to make clear if there will be a floor on  how low the price can go. R$40.MWh Do you intend for the price to be able to  go below zero?  If so, what do you intend to happen?  Based on your answers  we will need to go to outside counsel to make sure we do not violate the  Brazilian anti-gaming laws or any regulations.    I may have missed the point of how the trade is supposed to work so any  additional information would be helpful before we go to outside counsel.   Thanks.

2022-04-04 01:56:58+00:00,true,3,"  I am still somewhat unclear on the indexing structure but I will specify what  I see the deal as and you can correct me if I get it wrong. When the deal was described to me it sounded like we were buying a floor and  that we would imbed the floor into the physical power deal.  After looking at  the structure you sent it looks like they are the ones buying the floor. They  are getting paid (by virtue of the reduced cost of energy) if the spot goes  below the strike.  Based on your email this is how I think the deal would be structured.  We supply on a firm basis 3MW of energy for three months.  They pay a floating price for the energy based on the following formula:  R$42.75 minus an amount, if positive, equal to [factor] multiplied by the  difference between [a strike price in R$] and the Spot Price.  The Spot Price  will be in R$ per pound of a paper product quoted in R$ [which is to be  defined]. (I did not understand your third bullet point very well.  The  relationship between the two indexes was unclear and contrary to your formula  it did not appear that these indexes were quoted in R$.  Please clarify these  issues for me.)   We will need to know where and when to pick up the spot  price so that everyone understands what published price will be used each  month when the price is determined.  The [factor] will be something you will  need to come up with to correlate the volumes you are hedging with the amount  of electricity actually sold.  We will also need to make clear if there will  be a floor on how low the price can go.  Do you intend for the price to be  able to go below zero?  If so, what do you intend to happen?  Based on your  answers we will need to go to outside counsel to make sure we do not violate  the Brazilian anti-gaming laws or any regulations.  I may have missed the point of how the trade is supposed to work so any  additional information would be helpful before we go to outside counsel.  Thanks.

Believe it or not, it actually is ""good to be back.""   And thanks to Louise's timely intervention, I actually get to stay in Houston  this week instead of coming over to London for the ISDA meetings.  We discussed the need to have the lawyers review the long descriptions  yesterday and Mark Dilworth is checking on whether or not all the lawyers  actually have access to the necessary programs on their machines.  He and I  are meeting later this morning to talk about several of the items in your  note and we have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning to show all the  lawyers involved how to use the system to review the long descriptions.  The other topics I had on my list to keep moving this week are the matching  of GTC's with products and continued progress on the Counterparty spreadsheet.  Harry Collins is the emissions guy.  I'm assuming he'll be part of this  process tomorrow and I'll ask him to take a close look at the long  descriptions and how the mesh with the GTC's.  Finally, I agree with you on the GTC variables issue.  My plan is to ask the  lawyers involved to focus on this as they review the long descriptions for  which they are responsible.  With me here to answer questions that may result  in more progress but I'm still not convinced that's enough.  I hope to be  able to spend some of my own time looking at these as you have over the last  couple of weeks but realistically I don't think that will happen very soon.

Mark    David Forster 09/14/99 07:06 AM To: Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Legal Stuff  Mark,  Welcome back!  I am wondering if you could lend a hand on a few areas on the legal side of  EnronOnline:  1) GTC Cross reference (see prior email) 2) Product Long Descriptions - these are now available in the same format as  the customer will see - i.e. all put together by the system, as opposed to  individual sentences in a spreadsheet. The traders should have set up all of  the products which were required for the simulation (I haven't confirmed  this). These products would be a good place to start and should provide a  representative sample for the lawyers to look at. There are a few changes  coming, as requested by Louise Hansen, Stacy Dickson and Janice Moore which I  have not yet incorporated (but hope to within the next 2 days or so) -  otherwise, the other products should be OK as they contain text derived from  the spreadsheets which the lawyers have approved.  It would be helpful if you could organize for each of the lawyers to access  the Product Manager, so they can see the long descriptions for the Products.  Someone in the Product Control Group should be able to show you how to access  the long descriptions in the Product Manager   3) Emissions - Are you the emissions guy? I haven't actually discussed these  with anyone - not sure if the lawyer list I have includes the person who  should be looking after this?    Mark Taylor   Leslie Hansen   Jeff Hodge   Janice Moore   Alan Aronowitz   Harry Collins   Stacy Dickson   4) I still do not have a warm and fuzzy feeling that the GTC variables have  been properly cross-referenced to the spreadsheets, and that the two work  together to form a cohesive whole. I might just be paranoid, but I think this  area needs closer examination. Perhaps you could spot-check a couple of GTC's  against the products and see what you think?  Thanks for your help   Dave        ","Mark, In terms of the order for which we should look at things, I would suggest that we use the same order as the launch schedule - effectively giving as much time as possible to review and change as required for each.

2022-04-04 20:48:37+00:00,true,4,"  On Tues. 9/21 I met with Phil Zirngibl, the Alliance manager for Ft. James.   I informed him Enron wanted the original $10mm back.  It was our belief that   FJ did not act in good faith in ""expeditiously and fairly evaluating"" all of  Enron's energy proposals.  Phil argued that Enron saw substantial revenue  from the commodity (gas & coal) deals that were executed.  I argued that  commodity deals were never the ""intent"" of the Alliance as outlined in the  ""Objectives of the Parties.""  I told him we didn't need an Alliance agreement  to do commodity deals.  Phil was only prepared to argue the definition of ""substantial assets"" as it  related to the asset sale.  I told him Kalamazoo was substantial to us  because that was where we had a significant energy project.  It was also  substantial because the mill was ranked in the top 3 in terms of natural gas  consumption.  FJ let us work on the Kzoo project for 9 months before  informing us the mill would be sold.  I told Phil this is not how Alliance  partners treat each other.  I asked Phil if he was prepared to offer any proposal to resolve the  situation.  His response was FJ was happy with the Alliance and wanted to  continue with it ""as is.""  My response was that was not acceptable to Enron.  I told him the list of potential mediators for the dispute was being sent to  their counsel Greg Chaffee.  Next Steps:  I think we need to pick out a couple of strong project examples to use in our  case to present to the mediator.  Rather than just show the list of potential  deals Enron pitched and the lost opportunity value, I think a stronger case  to get our original $10mm back is to say here are 3 examples, here is the  value to both parties, and FJ still did not do the project (or they chose to  do it themselves).  This should go a long way to proving ""bad faith"".    I will get with David Barr and start assembling this information along with  the entire project list and the various ""reasons"" FJ chose not to do the  projects.  Based on this initial meeting, if the parties can't resolve the dispute  within 30 days, the dispute goes to non-binding mediation.  The parties are  to meet with the mediator within 21 days of the dispute being referred to the  mediator.  Per the Alliance agreement, the mediation meeting should take  place anytime between now and November 10.  Let me know if you have questions.

If we are going to prevent a utility/gov/pension fund from trading financial  products because of state law and we have state of incorporation, we should  ensure that the entity we are barring is at least in the same state as the  law in question.  If this has not been the case, one way to update the information would be to  list the states which have restrictive legislation and then apply the list to  the companies for which we have state of incorporation information. An Excel  Vlookup would accomplish this quite quickly. This is not perfect, but would  at least ensure that utilities in states without the legislation are not  barred - although I recognize it might bar some companies in states where the  legislation may be so specific as not to preclude the trading of financial  products for some utilities under certain circumstances.  Frank: Could you please forward an updated list of state of incorporation  information to Tana?  One last point (thanks, Bob): If a particular state has restrictive  legislation, is it our obligation to prevent the utility from trading  financial products, or does the obligation rest with the utility? i.e. is  there any reason for us to be barring them, or can we simply give them the  ability to transact financial products with EnronOnline and rely on their  internal controls? If we don't have any legal obligation to police, I'm  reluctant to do anything which would imply we are assuming this  responsibility.  Mark: Can you comment on this last point?

The biggest consideration with derivatives is the  country of incorporation (and additionally, the country(ies) in which trading  will take place).  For the bulk of our swap counterparties, i.e. energy  companies, state law currently isn't an in issue on approval of swap  trading.  It is more of an issues with governmentals, utilities, insurance  companies, pension funds and the like, and we do not capture that information  until we are in active neogtiation with a counterparty.  With utilities, you  cannot make a general assumption that any particular state law that applies  to one utility will apply to another.  Each utility need to be looked at  individually to see which state or federal law may apply to that counterparty.  The bulk of you customer list is not financial counterparties we are in  active negotiation with, so we are not capturing state of incorporation.

And thanks to Louise's timely intervention, I actually get to stay in Houston  this week instead of coming over to London for the ISDA meetings.  We discussed the need to have the lawyers review the long descriptions  yesterday and Mark Dilworth is checking on whether or not all the lawyers  actually have access to the necessary programs on their machines.  He and I  are meeting later this morning to talk about several of the items in your  note and we have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning to show all the  lawyers involved how to use the system to review the long descriptions.  The other topics I had on my list to keep moving this week are the matching  of GTC's with products and continued progress on the Counterparty spreadsheet.  Harry Collins is the emissions guy.  I'm assuming he'll be part of this  process tomorrow and I'll ask him to take a close look at the long  descriptions and how the mesh with the GTC's.  Finally, I agree with you on the GTC variables issue.  My plan is to ask the  lawyers involved to focus on this as they review the long descriptions for  which they are responsible.  With me here to answer questions that may result  in more progress but I'm still not convinced that's enough.  I hope to be  able to spend some of my own time looking at these as you have over the last  couple of weeks but realistically I don't think that will happen very soon.

I am wondering if you could lend a hand on a few areas on the legal side of  EnronOnline:  1) GTC Cross reference (see prior email) 2) Product Long Descriptions - these are now available in the same format as  the customer will see - i.e. all put together by the system, as opposed to  individual sentences in a spreadsheet. The traders should have set up all of  the products which were required for the simulation (I haven't confirmed  this). These products would be a good place to start and should provide a  representative sample for the lawyers to look at. There are a few changes  coming, as requested by Louise Hansen, Stacy Dickson and Janice Moore which I  have not yet incorporated (but hope to within the next 2 days or so) -  otherwise, the other products should be OK as they contain text derived from  the spreadsheets which the lawyers have approved.  It would be helpful if you could organize for each of the lawyers to access  the Product Manager, so they can see the long descriptions for the Products.  Someone in the Product Control Group should be able to show you how to access  the long descriptions in the Product Manager   3) Emissions - Are you the emissions guy?

Mark Taylor   Leslie Hansen   Jeff Hodge   Janice Moore   Alan Aronowitz   Harry Collins   Stacy Dickson   4) I still do not have a warm and fuzzy feeling that the GTC variables have  been properly cross-referenced to the spreadsheets, and that the two work  together to form a cohesive whole.

Where on the matrix it was not clear where an entity  was incorporated it was assumed for this purpose NOT to have been  incorporated in the US.

We have only recently requested a full extract of this information from D&B  for our counterparties (because this is also required for SAP).  Because of difficulties in matching our records to D&B - their names are NOT  always the exact legal name - we have only been able to obtain  roughly 7365 out of the more than 11,400 records we have (65%).  Of the 7365  records matched, not all have State of Incorporation either because   1) They are not U.S. parties or 2) They are not incorporated entities or 3)  D&B is missing the information (990).   We recently obtained a list of state of incorporation for companies from  Legal which is the source we were going to use to populate this information  for the  ones we were missing.  We hired temps to do this, but were then  requested to stop this activity by Frank Davis.   For Foreign entities, the country of incorporation has been difficult to  find as it is not readily available from D&B.  Any knowledge or suggestions  would be appreciated.  We are changing our procedures to request this information when we call the  counterparty to collect information for setup.  In reviewing the counterparty matrix of 9/8, we can assist with providing  some of the state of incorporations for parties in Sections 2,3, and 4.  I  have asked IT to extract this information from GCP for you.  Country of  Incorporation for non-U.S. does not yet exist in GCP - this is currently  under development with a target production date of mid-October therefore,  this cannot be provided.

Many of the defined terms on the GTC are not referenced or (in some cases)  not quantified by the MPS.  This could obvously give rise to confusion and possibly disputes with  customers, revolving around central commercial terms.  I have prepared two emails - one for Andy/Elena/Mark, who are responsible for  the MPS and one for Stacy, who I understand is responsible for the legal  review of the MPS and the GTC. Each email contains more detailed comments and  will be sent to you shortly.  I would appreciate it if responses could be incorporated into the MPS by  Wednesday, Sept. 1 at the latest.  Note that wherever possible, I have suggested amendments which preserve the  logical structure of the MPS, so as to minimize any delay to the project  which these changes could cause.

2022-04-04 15:22:07+00:00,true,4,"  Fine - I will follow up with Jennifer and Torrey before convening with the  legal team at 11 am (5 UK).   m       David Forster 15/09/99 09:50 To: Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Dilworth/LON/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: Long Descriptions - Indexes    Thanks for your recent emails. My response to various issues raised:  Before Torrey Moorer and Jennifer deBloisBlac Denney met with the confirms  people, I said:  1) The GTC + Long Description should cover all of the elements necessary to  form an unambiguous contract. The paper confirmation should just be a written  record of what has already been agreed and should not introduce any new  concepts.  2) The Long Descriptions should cover everything which a trader would (both  explicitly and implicitly) discuss over the telephone.  At this point, I have received all of Torrey and Jennifer's comments and they  have been incorporated. I have also received comments from Andy Thomas, which  he says incorporates everything which he received. Therefore, all feedback  which was given to any of the above three individuals should now be reflected  in the spreadsheet and the database.  In some cases, certain items of feedback were ignored because they were  incorrect - e.g. the addition of a ""price"" field to the PAI list.  There were  also some cases when multiple requests to language changes occurred to a  single data item, or certain items of feedback were superceded by others. If  someone says that they provided feedback which you believe is valid for  inclusion and which has not been incorporated, please let me know the details  of the change and who the request was passed to.  Thanks,  Dave      To: David Forster/LON/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Long Descriptions - Indexes  Dave:  One item that was left open after my meeting with Mark D. this morning was  what the Index should look like and how much input we have had from the  confirm desk.  My inclination was that the index should be the same language  that we currently use in the confirmation on the theory that the GTC taken  together with the long description should result in a complete, unambiguous  contract.  Mark felt that the index should provide a more complete  description than the short description abbreviation but that the full legal  text could wait for the paper confirm.  Given Mark's view as to how this field should be dealt with, it may be that  the confirm desk has in fact looked at all of these and said they look fine  as far as they go and has not attempted to correct them with the full legal  language.  Mark said he would be contacting you himself but I thought it might make  sense to give you my version as well.  What are your thoughts?  If you'd like to discuss, I will be in by 9:00  tomorrow but have a meeting at 10 and then the meeting with all of the  lawyers and Mark to discuss the further long description review at 11.

Have you any exotic destinations planned  for this year's vacation?  Anyway - I'm planning to go on vacation with my family (yah - it's weird to  say ""family"" now!)  to Perth from Thursday 23 September through to Saturday 3  October and was wondering whether you could help 'babysit' the Petron  matter.  Janice had mentioned that you'd done some due diligence on ISDA in  the Philippines a year or so ago so I thought that you would probably be the  most appropriate person to look after this matter in my absence.  Matt, who  is a new attorney who joined us in the Singapore office last week, will also  be keeping track of this file but he hasn't been fully 'Enronized' by Tana as  yet (tho' he will be so before Thanksgiving as he'll be headed to Houston  next month for a month's stint there) so I thought it best if you could be  the main contact person for Petron as well as for our business folks during  that week that I'm not around.  I really hope that you don't mind.  Assuming that you're OK with this, I would like to give your name and contact  details to the Enron AP/A/CHI biz folks who are handling this - Manuel  Gallego in the Philippines, Victor Santos who is presently relocating to  Singapore and David Terlip to whom they report.  The traders in the Singapore  office, John Chismar and Eng Wang Moi , will be providing the pricing.  Matt  and my assistant, Angeline, will get hold of you should they hear from Petron  during that week.  The plan is that Petron is interested in entering into  some crack spread swaps with us.  So far, Citibank and Chase have signed up  ISDAs with Petron.  In the meantime, I'll have Angeline fax to you copies of all the  correspondence which I've had had with our Filipino counsel QTE to-date so  that you'll get a good idea of what the regulatory and legal environment's  like now in the Philippines. [Angeline - can you please do that today.   Sara's fax no. is Houston Legal's fax no.]  So far, QTE has reviewed our draft ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex and  I sent it across to Petron's inhouse counsel on 8 September (please see  attached) and I'm now waiting for their written comments on those drafts.

We have carefully reviewed your settlement offer and sought clarification where needed.  As a result, PG&E is able to accept most of the changes and provisions contained in that proposal, and is offering back a few modifications which we think should allow us to reach closure on a multi-party OFO Settlement Agreement.  We encourage all parties to sign this settlement.  Our September 24, 1999 response is attached in two forms.  One is a summary of the items we agree with and those where we have changes, including the reason for our changes.  The second is a revision-marking of the September 15 proposal to show all the specific changes, including some minor edits. We have not included the tariff revisions to support this package, but will provide them once we have a final agreement.  At this point, the changes to the prior tariff drafts are straight forward.  Also attached is a draft Joint Motion for your review and approval.  Our suggested approach is to have Settlement Parties sign the motion as the means of signifying their approval of the Settlement and the need for expeditious Commission action.  We have scheduled a Settlement Conference next week on Tuesday, September 28, starting at 10:00 a.m. in Room 308, 77 Beale Street, San Francisco. HOWEVER, the attendance of a couple key parties is problematic, and we may need to move this settlement meeting to accommodate their schedules so we can ensure a productive day.  We will advise you no later than Monday morning of the meeting status and possible next steps.  We appreciate your continued active participation in this settlement process and look forward to your feedback on our modifications.

This tab shows a list of Product Types and an index of   Product Additional Information (PAI) fields which apply to each Product Type.  There are further tabs on the spreadsheet which correspond to the PAI's. The  descriptions which appear to the customers on the website will be comprised  of the Product description on the LongDesc tab and the descriptions from the  applicable parts of the applicable PAI tabs.  I have confirmed that this  spreadsheet contains all comments received to date, excluding financials,  which we are working on seperately.     Following is a suggested process:  -  List all of the variables in the GTC which would need to be quantified or  defined in the MPS. Think of the MPS as being the equivalent of the trader's  conversation with the customer (which is reflected in a final confirmation),  which covers the commercial, specific terms of the deal.  - Compare this list with the MPS. Confirm that the language of the MPS  conforms with the requirements of the GTC. Rember to check both the Product  description found on the LongDesc tab as well as the tabs for each of the  PAI's for that Product. The PAI's for each Product are listed on the  ShortDesc page.  - Don't worry about any missing entries for index types, locations, etc.  These should be filled for accuracy and completeness by the confirmations  groups. Any changes you make to Products language will be incorporated into  any new additions.  - Make any changes on the spreadsheet using a red font to highlight and email  it back to Andrew Thomas.  3) Once the above is complete, and all additions from the confirmations  groups have been incorporated, we will email back a complete set for final  approval.

2022-04-04 14:41:43+00:00,true,4,"  Mark,  Welcome back!  I am wondering if you could lend a hand on a few areas on the legal side of  EnronOnline:  1) GTC Cross reference (see prior email) 2) Product Long Descriptions - these are now available in the same format as  the customer will see - i.e. all put together by the system, as opposed to  individual sentences in a spreadsheet. The traders should have set up all of  the products which were required for the simulation (I haven't confirmed  this). These products would be a good place to start and should provide a  representative sample for the lawyers to look at. There are a few changes  coming, as requested by Louise Hansen, Stacy Dickson and Janice Moore which I  have not yet incorporated (but hope to within the next 2 days or so) -  otherwise, the other products should be OK as they contain text derived from  the spreadsheets which the lawyers have approved.  It would be helpful if you could organize for each of the lawyers to access  the Product Manager, so they can see the long descriptions for the Products.  Someone in the Product Control Group should be able to show you how to access  the long descriptions in the Product Manager   3) Emissions - Are you the emissions guy? I haven't actually discussed these  with anyone - not sure if the lawyer list I have includes the person who  should be looking after this?    Mark Taylor   Leslie Hansen   Jeff Hodge   Janice Moore   Alan Aronowitz   Harry Collins   Stacy Dickson   4) I still do not have a warm and fuzzy feeling that the GTC variables have  been properly cross-referenced to the spreadsheets, and that the two work  together to form a cohesive whole. I might just be paranoid, but I think this  area needs closer examination. Perhaps you could spot-check a couple of GTC's  against the products and see what you think?

2022-04-04 15:48:02+00:00,true,4,"  Tana,  State of incorporation has been captured for a large number of the  counterparties and has been used as the basis for the determination of  financial trading status by our tax group.  If we are going to prevent a utility/gov/pension fund from trading financial  products because of state law and we have state of incorporation, we should  ensure that the entity we are barring is at least in the same state as the  law in question.  If this has not been the case, one way to update the information would be to  list the states which have restrictive legislation and then apply the list to  the companies for which we have state of incorporation information. An Excel  Vlookup would accomplish this quite quickly. This is not perfect, but would  at least ensure that utilities in states without the legislation are not  barred - although I recognize it might bar some companies in states where the  legislation may be so specific as not to preclude the trading of financial  products for some utilities under certain circumstances.  Frank: Could you please forward an updated list of state of incorporation  information to Tana?  One last point (thanks, Bob): If a particular state has restrictive  legislation, is it our obligation to prevent the utility from trading  financial products, or does the obligation rest with the utility? i.e. is  there any reason for us to be barring them, or can we simply give them the  ability to transact financial products with EnronOnline and rely on their  internal controls? If we don't have any legal obligation to police, I'm  reluctant to do anything which would imply we are assuming this  responsibility.  Mark: Can you comment on this last point?

The biggest consideration with derivatives is the  country of incorporation (and additionally, the country(ies) in which trading  will take place).  For the bulk of our swap counterparties, i.e. energy  companies, state law currently isn't an in issue on approval of swap  trading.  It is more of an issues with governmentals, utilities, insurance  companies, pension funds and the like, and we do not capture that information  until we are in active neogtiation with a counterparty.  With utilities, you  cannot make a general assumption that any particular state law that applies  to one utility will apply to another.  Each utility need to be looked at  individually to see which state or federal law may apply to that counterparty.  The bulk of you customer list is not financial counterparties we are in  active negotiation with, so we are not capturing state of incorporation.

My inclination was that the index should be the same language  that we currently use in the confirmation on the theory that the GTC taken  together with the long description should result in a complete, unambiguous  contract.  Mark felt that the index should provide a more complete  description than the short description abbreviation but that the full legal  text could wait for the paper confirm.  Given Mark's view as to how this field should be dealt with, it may be that  the confirm desk has in fact looked at all of these and said they look fine  as far as they go and has not attempted to correct them with the full legal  language.

2022-04-04 03:24:24+00:00,true,5,"  Tom,  I was trying to calculate how long it took just last night.  Because of the quake and it being August, my teaching schedule is slimer than usual.  (I had already been keeping it pretty slim [15-20 hours per week, including preparation time].)  So I only had to work in the mornings this week.  On Tuesday, I spent the afternoon on a first draft, probably 5 or so hours total.  I wasn't that happy with it, as I spent too much of it synthisizing what I had been reading about the big picture (after all, this was for a newspaper).  That night I meet with Ismail (who, by the way, is a journalist) and he encouraged me to write it more like I had been writing the other things I've written since I've been here.  He was right, though I already knew it.  (Your commments also brought this point home.)  I went home that night and worked it over some more, until 3:00 or so in the morning, then again the next day in the afternoon.  What does that add up to?  The writing, maybe 12 or so hours, with some thinking and dsicussion in between.  Hope Dad and Sue get a chance to follow this all in Alaska. There are probably Interent Cafes there. Mom, I guess, can read it in Sunday's paper(!).  By the way, how is mom?  With dad doing all the writing from home I don't get a strong imression about how she is. (I had asked earlier if everything was all right, but got no reponse to that question.)  Is everyting all right?  More later, as I want to get this off in case you're still there (though Ihipe you've gone home for some shut eye).  I have to sign off in about 20 minutes and get ready for my class.

2022-04-04 22:51:45+00:00,true,5,"  Give me a call with any questions.    Christian Yoder  09/27/99 03:54 PM To: Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT cc: Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Request for Editing  Mark, We are one step away from signing a brand new, much needed master power  agreement with Duke, with whom we presently have over $46 million of MTM in  the money exposure without adequate contracts.  That one step is over the  hurdle of how we calculate termination payments.  Please, as you have so  helpfully done in the past,  edit the following conversation between Mr. Know  it All and Mr. Struggler.  Know It All:  I don't have a lot of time so get to the point.  Struggler:  Why can't we supplement  the expression ""present value of the  economic benefit"" when we define the word ""Gains"" with the expression:   ""using the Discount Rate"" and defining the term so everybody understands how  we calculate the present value of the  gains?  Know it All:   I've gone over this a number of times with you before, but  here we go again:  there are a number of ways to calculate gains and losses.   when we calculate our gains or losses, we are really just going One method is  to go out to the market and asking a third party how much they would charge  us (or pay us) to step into the tragically truncated transaction.   Because  it is relatively fair, straightforward and easy enough to document, this  would probably be our first approach in a default situation.  Struggler:  So, why don't we just say:  ""the value of the foregone economic  benefit?""  Why do we even have to say anything about the stupid present value  of it?  Know it All:  Ahem, because, we want to maintain as much flexibility as  possible and another method would be to calculate the total string of  payments we might have expected to recieve from the defaulting party reduced  by the payments we would have had to make.  Since we will receive the  termination payment up front, it isn't fair to get the full amount of that  total but rather only the ""present value.""  In addition, using the  replacement transaction (market quote) method the present value is the  already built into the curve price that's quoted you numbskull!  Another  method would be to unwind our hedge on the other side of the terminated  transaction - presumably the amount the counterparty to the hedge would  charge (or pay) to unwind that transaction will be very close to the amount  calculated by the market quotation (replacement transaction) method.  This  last method is quite handy when the terminated transaction was entered into  to offset a particular trade or when the market has dried up and there are no  quotes to be had.  Struggler:  Okay,  my understanding of present value is that you imagine a  guy who is going to get $100 at a future date, let us say, one year from  now.  Do you follow me so far?  Know it All:  Please.  Struggler:  Now, instead of the guy getting the $100 one year from now, he  gets it today.  But, the $100 today is worth a lot more  than it will be one  year from now because the guy is also getting a year of time and time is  money and he can invest the money at a known return rate and so if you gave  him the full $100 today he would invest it and one year from now have  $170  instead of $100 and that wouldn't be fair so you are supposed to give him  today just the minimal amount you can get away with so he can invest it and  come out with $100 one year from now.  And so, to figure out how much less  than $100 to give the guy today, you ""DISCOUNT"" the $100 by some damn rate  that everybody seems to know about.   Do you understand?  Know it All:   You've pretty well botched it up at a sixth grade level, but  that's the idea.  Struggler:  So, now, if we are calculating the ""present value of the economic  gain"" of a terminated transaction aren't we basically saying that we would  have received $100 in the future for the power , however we now should get  $30 because we have discounted it with the sacred rate and so why can't we  say that the present value is derived from the ""Discount Rate?""  Know it All:  Your lack of real world experience is painful to behold.  Pleae  make sure you call somebody if you are ever asked to calculate one of these  things.  The Curves price that is quoted to us by the presumably creditworthy  replacement counterparty or the counterparty to a hedge that is being unwound  already takes into account the present valuing principle.  And of course, if  you end up having to discount a stream of payments, there are big problems.   First, how will you figure out what those payments might have been?  This  isn't a loan where principle and interest payments can be caluclated in  advance with certainty - the payments will fluctuate witht the floating price  in a swap or the cost of replacement power in a physical deal.  And even if  we can figure that out how can we agree on the appropriate discount rate?  An  in-the-money non-defaulting party wants it to be as low as possible since  that will maximize the termination payment received.  But if the  non-defaulting party is out-of-the-money then he will want the discount rate  as high as possible to minimize the payment he has to make.  And just to  complicate things a bit further, these contracts are usually bilateral so we  have to be willing to eat what we serve.  So our contract language just says  the whole thing has to be ""commercially reasonable.""  In our view that's  enough to protect us from a rapacious counterparty if we default and flexible  enough to let us come to a reasonable result when we are the non-defaulting  party.  Struggler:  I thought the curve was just a list of prices.  You go out to  October 2000 and you see $34.  Isn't that number the price we expect to pay  for power or get paid for it on that future date and shouldn't we discount  that number if we are getting the money one year early?  Know it All:  No!  That $34 is the present value amount we would be willing  to pay today of what we think for power that will be delivered one year from  now.  Struggler:  You mean we thing one year from now that power will actually be  $100 and that discounted, it comes back to $34 on our curve at this very  moment?  Know it All:  You've got it buddy.  Do you think you can handle that  concept?  Or do I have to go over it again?    Struggler:  Hmmm.  Well I guess so, but why don't we just say  ""the value of  the economic benefit based on the Non-Defaulting Party's curve""?  Know it All:  Because then somebody would want to define the word ""curve"" and  at that point you are getting too close to our holy of holies and we won't  ever define our curve.  Struggler.  Hmmm.  Okay.  Thanks.      ","We have been around for several months, and I know it all: ""Request for Editing.""

Turkey has a population of some 65 million, up from only some 14 million at its birth in 1923.  The per capita income is just over $3,000 a year, close to Mexico's.  The areas hit so hard by the recent earthquake have experienced growth rates in the last few decades that probably have few precedents in human history.  Istanbul, for example, has grown from some 1 to 1.5 million people 30 years ago to what some estimate to be a population of between 12 to 15 million today! Most of these folks are from or are descendants of poor families who moved from the countryside to the industrial cities looking for a better life. The demand they created for housing, obviously, contributed to some of the corner cutting that has exacerbated so badly the recent disaster.

2022-04-04 10:16:28+00:00,true,6,"  Mom,  Your letter was wonderful.  I was ""transported"" to Illinois and the condo, and got a nice glimpse of your life there.  Thanks.  I hope you get a chance (or got a chance) to read Tom's and my correspondence.  I mentioned more than once how fun it was that Tom seemed as excited as I was.  What a rare and special happening it all was, especially for me in that Tom was so involved.  And what a great thing this e-mail gadget is, and that we were ALL able to experience it more or less simultaneously.  I don't know if you kept a copy of the Perspective section, but your can see (generally) the area where I live in the picture of Sancta Sophia on the first page.  If you look in the upper left-hand corner you'll see a finger of water.  That's the Golden Horn.  (To its left, starting roughly directly above the Sancta Sophia is the Bosphorus.)  The bridge that you see crossing the Golden Horn (we're still in the upper left hand corner) is the Galata Bridge.  Just above the bridge, approximately half an inch on the page is the blur of buildings where the Galata Tower and my place are.  I live in a neighborhood called Galata (though the sub-neighborhood is called Kuledibi).   I'll be bringing more clear pictures, but that's a start.  It IS amazing to think you all moved to condo nearly 22 years ago.  Its also amazing to think we all moved to Illinois only some 12 years before that. It seems like those 12 years were a lot longer than the 22 since.  Time is cruel, I think.  Your initial experience of cold, discomfort, rang a bell for me too.  When I moved in here it was also middle of winter (although Istanbul winters not quite as bad as Illinois winters; more like New York I think).  Had very little furniture (i.e. nothing really).  Ismail and I did bag a bed and, as I half-mentioned in the article, he and his wife lent an excellent comforter and another blanket to me.   I rely on heaters here, as no centralized heating.  At that time, along with the bed, I had bought a gas heater, which you're not supposed to use at night (in case there's a leak).  So the first few nights I buried my head under the blankets against the freezing temperatures.   Since then, have fully equipped the place (e.g. alos now have an electric heater, which you can use at night) and am ready (clothes and everything) for next winter.  (Also will pick up a few more things while I'm in SF.)   All this said, wouldn't have done it any other way.  Feel I paid a few dues and am better acclimated for the experience.  Life is considerably harder here than in America, but the good life not inaccessible.  There is everything from Marks & Spencer to McDonalds.   I, despite living on about $600 to 700 a month, live well and better than most.   I calculate that, provided you don't go too far up the scale, most things are a half to a third what they cost in SF. (Toothpaste, by the way -- even Crest -- is here in spades.)  Have you gotten a chance to talk to Jeff about his visit?  More later, and a lot of that in person.  Thanks again for the note and sending along the article.
