Backup quarterback leaving Texas  Associated Press  Posted: April 26, 2000  AUSTIN -- Adam Hall, the Texas Longhorns backup quarterback during spring drills, said he will transfer from the University of Texas this fall, coach Mack Brown announced Wednesday.  ""The biggest factor was that I want to have a chance to be a starter in the near future,"" said Adam Hall, a redshirt freshman from Westlake High School.  The university has released Hall from his  scholarship. Hall plans to complete the spring semester then enroll in another institution in the fall. The new institution was not named in a news release.  ""I love all of my teammates and appreciate everything the coaches and staff have done for me at Texas, but I think I will have a better opportunity to play sooner at another school,"" he said.  Hall completed four of five passes for 85 yards and a touchdown in Texas' spring game on April 1. He completed 143 of 263 passes for 2,188 yards and 21 touchdowns at Westlake  in 1998.  Brown said Hall was a hardworking young man on the field and in the classroom. He wished the 6-foot-2, 205-pound quarterback luck at his next destination.  ""Obviously we are very disappointed because we felt that Adam had a good spring and we have been very pleased with his progress,"" Brown said.  I'll call you when I get home tonight (around 6).

2022-04-10 05:51:10+00:00,true,3,"  On 3/30/2000, FERC issued an order accepting InPower's market based rates  schedule that would permit entities that own generation to meet their own  loads or for back up purposes (IPPs) to sell power at market based rates to  InPower (on a profit share basis).  InPower made the filing stating it  estimated that IPPs in MAIN (and, specifically, Wisconsin) could supply a  substantial portion of the summer energy shortfalls (FERC did not limit  ImPower to IPPs in MAIN).  InPower did not name any specific IPPs; however,  to be eligible under ImPower's program, an IPP must control generation  primarily for the purpose of meeting on-site demand or providing back-up  generation and have such generation located on its premises or premises  approved by the local utility.  Further, the generation must be capable of  producing electricity either synchronous with the local utilities' grid or  commensurate with agreements with the local utility.  Total sales made by  IPPs in ImPower's program would not exceed 1000 MW/ hour.  The IPPs are in  businesses other than the sale of electricity and are simply seeking  ""incremental return on the often-unused capacity of their generation assets.""  When an IPP participates in ImPower's program, it becomes subject to FERC's  jurisdiction as a ""public utility.""    Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) protested ImPower's filing stating it  allows retail customers to arbitrage retail and wholesale power markets by  purchasing power at average, embedded cost retail rates and simultaneously  using their generating facilities to sell power at wholesale to ImPower (at  peak times).  FERC addressed JEA's concerns by saying that the IPPs cannot  violate any rules and requirements properly imposed on the retail sales made  to those suppliers.  This order allows ImPower (as an aggregator) to make the required quarterly  filings for the IPPs and the IPPs do not have to apply for separate market  based rates authority.  The are some additional reporting requirements FERC  waived for the IPPs: accounting and reporting, issuance of securities and  interlocking directorates (an affidavit is still needed).  I do not know if  the IPPs are still required to become Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs), but  will check on that.  EWG approval takes 60 days (plus filing preparation  time).  The Enron Industrial group may want to consider making a similar type of  filing.  Please let me know if you would like a copy of the filing or order.","On 3/30/2000, FERC issued an order accepting InPower's market-based rates schedule that would permit entities that own generation to meet their own loads or for back-up purposes (IPPs) to sell power at market-based rates to InPower (and, specifically, Wisconsin"

2022-04-10 12:31:27+00:00,true,4,"  Hi folks:  Very glad to hear about the new developments. Just to recap what we  discussed this morning about different things you need to look into to set up  trading operations and the contacts:  1. Licence to trade: Regulatory people: I guess you know about this part  better than me.  2. Trading & Risk Mgmt: Global Risk Mgmt oversight: John Sherrif in London  has the overall responsibility outside Western Hemisphere. Research group can  help with the structuring models used for trading.  3. Risk Conrols: Before trading group is operational, it needs to get the  authorization from the Board of Directors of Enron along with total position  limits and possibly value@risk limits. These limits are typically by  commodity type and by region. Risk Assessment & Control (RAC) under Rick Buy  performs the internal control function ensuring that the businesses adhere to  these trading limits.  Ted Murphy is the VP in RAC overseeing the trading  operations. The value@risk models come from the Research group, but  day-to-day monitoring of the numbers is done by Ted's group.   4. Credit Risk: A credit reserve number is computed for each deal (again, the  models are created by Research) and is transferred to the credit group under  Bill Bradford (also in RAC). This is basically like buying insurance from the  corp. , so that if there is a couterparty default, the loss is covered by the  reserve pool of the credit dept.  5. Legal: The name I was given is Alan Aronowitz for legal help.  6. Back Office: Initially can survive with Excel spreadsheets. You should  contact the IT though when the plans finalize to talk about systems.   Australia is the most recent place where we set up the trading operations.  You can talk to Paul Quilky, the trader there to talk about these issues  (mention to him that Grant Masson in Research gave his name).   Barry Pierce in London was incharge of back office at the begin there.  I can coordinate for talking with people next week. Give me a call Monday if  possible. I hadn't the time to search for the presentation stuff today. Will  do it next week.  Krishna.",Hi folks: Very glad to hear about the new developments.

Learning about Enron's use of leading-edge practices was quite enlightening and I truly benefited from our visit.  Secondly, I've summarized my key ""take-aways"" as stated below.  Before conveying it to my management, however, I really appreciate it if you can pls review my conclusions and ensure that they are not miss-stated.  Again, thanks so much for your time and wisdom.  I was also honored that you gave me a copy of the ""Managing Energy Price Risk"" book and shall reference it with interest.  THANK YOU.

The latest Fortune article on ENE is a great read and substantiates the company's innovative and creative approach to business. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ As you may know, I was invited to visit with Enron (ENE) last week.  I met with Vince Kaminski, the VP and head of research in the risk management group of ENE.  Vince who used to be with Salomon Brothers and AT&T is the ""brain"" of ENE w.r.t. their analytical tools for pricing of commodities, hedging, optimization of financial and physical transactions, as well as the value-at-risk systems.  In addition, Vince has received the 1999 James H. McGraw Award for Energy Risk Management (Energy Risk Manager of the Year) and is well published.  He is the key contributor to a best-selling publication by Risk Books entitled: Managing Energy Price Risk.  Our meeting was mainly focused on gaining additional insights re leading-edge practices within ENE.  My key findings are summarized below:  1. ENE does not use corporate price premises.  They use market price info only and adhere to mark-to-market accounting. 2. ENE uses the ""Heath, Jarrow, and Morton"" methods for modeling price dynamics (I've asked BIC for a copy of the associated paper).  They have their own ""home-grown"" software, however, they periodically review selected external developments for internal inclusion and advancement. 3. Vince's group comprises of Mathematicians, Physicists, and Operations Researchers who are responsible for the development and advancement of ENE's risk management tools.  These models are religiously used by the traders, risk managers, and BUs across ENE. 4. Investment proposals are screened, risked, and ""ROVed"" by a separate corporate group (similar to our Special Studies and with business and real options skills) who work in conjunction with the BUs.  All evaluations and transactions are marked-to-market. 5. ENE does not use efficient-frontier portfolio concepts.  They ""VC fund"" any opportunity that has a credible value proposition and can stand on its own.  They believe that with the current plentiful liquidity in the market, project-financing in not an issue for a ""good"" opportunity.  However, they closely monitor the development of each opportunity, within their deep portfolio, at the corporate level and know how to ""fail fast"". 6. The employee reward system is based on P&Ls as well as the creation of new business. 7. Most employees have stock options.  I really enjoyed my visit and hope to meet with Vince again the next time I'm in Houston.   ","Soussan, it looks fine. Look forward to meeting you again in Houston or New York.

I would like to talk to you some more about the opportunities available in Enron Networks. Two areas I thought would be interesting would either be helping to structure a market for Enron Networks to enter, or help develop a market that Enron Networks is in the process of entering.  A couple of things that I thought were interesting about your strategy for B2B is that unlike most business plans where the strategy is build the site and the volume will come, Enron uses it's own volume to entice other people to participate. What most e-commerce sites want to do is charge for the dating process, but in reality this has very little value added unless the market is coupled with a finance/clearinghouse function and a physical delivary system for physical goods. We addressed some of these issues in the ilogex business plan.  I have attached a copy of the ilogex business plan to give you an idea of some of my thoughts on e-commerce.

Regards,    Eugenio  Review of energy policies kicks off     Asahi Shimbun   April 25, 2000   A government advisory panel on Monday embarked on a comprehensive review of energy-related policies.   ``We want to come up with feasible policies and at the same time clearly present reasons for those policies,'' Yoichi Kaya, a professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo, told a meeting of the Coordination Subcommittee under the Advisory Committee for Energy, an advisory panel to Minister of International Trade and Industry Takashi Fukaya. Kaya chairs the subcommittee.   The nuclear development policy, including the government's goal for building new nuclear power plants, is expected to be a focus of the discussions.   A spate of nuclear accidents have made construction of plants increasingly difficult, and the nation's power suppliers have reduced the number of new nuclear power plants expected to be in operation by fiscal 2010 from 20 to 13.   The subcommittee, set up for the first time in about 10 years, is made up of about 30 members, and members of anti-nuclear nongovernmental organizations have been included for the first time.   Some members told Monday's meeting that the government must stop taking the nuclear development policy for granted and seriously look into the possibility of introducing renewable energy, such as wind and solar power.   Also on the agenda will be energy saving measures.   Energy consumption in the residential and commercial sector, made up of homes and offices, and in the transportation sector, which includes cars and trucks, has almost doubled over the past 25 years.   At Monday's meeting, many members stressed the need to change public consciousness toward the use of energy.   MITI plans to present studies on how life would be affected by compulsory energy saving measures such as automatically turning off air conditioners at certain temperatures or vehicle engines when they are idle.

The slogan favoured by Jim Clark, creator of  Silicon Graphics,                     Net-scape and Healtheon, has become the mantra of a  generation of                     consultants and investment bankers. The new economy, they  claim, requires                     new principles of valuation.                       C.com is one of the most exciting prospects in  business-to-business                     commerce. It is the world leader in a growing market -  annual sales by 2010                     are likely to be Dollars 500,000bn. If C.com can maintain  a 5 per cent share                     and earn only 1 per cent net margin its prospective  annual earnings will be                     Dollars 250bn.                       If we assume that market growth after 2010 is 5 per cent  and discount future                     revenues at 10 per cent, the prospective value of C.com  is Dollars 5,000bn -                     about 10 times the recent market capitalisation of  Microsoft, Cisco or General                     Electric.                       You don't have to wait for the IPO. You can buy shares in  C.com right now for                     less than 5 per cent of that value. C.com is called  Citigroup and in addition to                     its foreign exchange trading, which is the business I  have described, you get                     its other wholesale, retail and investment banking  activities and a leading                     insurance company thrown in.                       Of course, nobody would be so stupid as to value  Citigroup in this way. Yet I                     have followed more or less exactly the methodology  recommended in the                     latest McKinsey quarterly for the valuation of new era  companies. They use                     precisely analogous calculations to arrive at a valuation  of Dollars 37bn for                     Amazon.com.                       Paul Gibbs, head of merger and acquisition research at  J.P. Morgan, recently                     used similar principles to confirm that assessment of  Amazon. He then                     performed the same calculation for internet service  provider Freeserve.                       Assume that UK retail sales grow at 5 per cent a year,  that 25 per cent of                     sales take place on the net, that portals capture 50 per  cent of these, that                     Freeserve gets 30 per cent of the portal share and  maintains an 8 per cent                     commission on sales. Multiply these together and you  establish that in 2017                     Freeserve will make profits of o2bn (Dollars 3.2bn).  This, he argues, justifies a                     value today of o6.50 per share.                       But I prefer T.com to Freeserve. T.com has a customer  base four times larger                     than Freeserve. Its franchise is stronger. Its customers  are concentrated in                     the affluent south-east of England, where it faces  virtually no competition.                     Market research shows that more than 95 per cent of its  customers use its                     essential services every day, many of them several times  a day.                       T.com also has ambitious plans for expansion. At present,  its geographical                     coverage is less than one-quarter of the market in  England and Wales. T.com                     has an interest in south-east Asia. The population of  China is 100 times the                     number of people who today can access T.com services.  Even after the recent                     market correction, T.com, better known as Thames Water,  still has a market                     valuation below that of Freeserve. At the widest point  between the old and new                     economies, Freeserve was worth four times as much.                       The reason the Citibank calculation is nonsense is  simple, but fundamental.                     The margins Citibank makes on its forex business vary  widely. If you buy                     small quantities of notes from a bank, the spread is much  wider than 1 per                     cent. If you are a large corporation trading major  currencies, the margin is                     wafer thin. Entry and competition force prices down to  the related costs.                       In Mr Gibbs's model, Freeserve earns profits of o2bn,  about equal to the                     current profits of Tesco, J. Sainsbury and Marks and  Spencer together. And it                     earns these on revenues of only o2.5bn, so that profits  are 80 per cent of the                     value of its sales. No established business earns margins  of that size.                       Thames Water is one of a tiny number of companies whose  market position is                     so strong, whose output is so necessary to life, that if  it charged five times the                     current price we would have little choice but to pay. We  do have one option -                     to insist the government intervenes. It confines Thames  Water to a return on                     its capital employed of about 6 per cent.                       The idea that profit is a return on capital invested  still has some role in new                     economy valuation, at the level of the overall market.                       There is a key formula in the new math. The required  yield on a security is                     equal to the difference between the rate of return  demanded from that class of                     securities and its expected rate of growth. So, if you  expect a return of 5.5 per                     cent from a share whose dividends will grow at 5 per  cent, calculations show                     that the dividend yield should be 0.5 per cent.                       This is the calculation done by James Glassman and Kevin  Hassett in their                     book Dow 36,000*. Claiming that sustainable dividends  average half of                     earnings, this yield equates to a price/earnings ratio of  100 - implying a target                     of 36,000 for the US index.                       The trouble with this theory is that it takes too long to  produce what the                     investor is looking for. Investors will receive only  two-fifths of the cash                     sustaining the valuation this century. One-third of the  total depends on                     dividend cheques that will arrive after 2200.                       Two hundred years ago, well before the Dow Jones average,  prudent,                     diversified investors would have owned slave traders and  sugar plantations, or                     perhaps a bold speculation in that symbol of the then new  economy -a canal.                     The next 200 years may be more stable than the last and  Microsoft and Cisco                     may prove more enduring than plantations. But we can  hardly be sure.                       While 5 per cent may be a reasonable assumption for the  growth rate of                     dividends in the US economy as a whole, it is likely that  well before 2200                     most of these will come from companies not yet founded.                       Suppose we accept Glassman and Hassett's protests that  their dividend                     growth expectations are conservative. If you raise them  only from 5 per cent to                     5.25 per cent, the anticipated value of the Dow Jones  average is 72,000. At                     5.5 per cent the formula breaks down because the shares  of US companies                     are infinitely valuable. Not even the most credulous  dotcom investor believes                     that.                       The math also works in reverse. If expectations of return  are 6 per cent rather                     than 5.5 per cent, the market p/e ratio falls to 50 and  the value of the Dow                     Jones from 36,000 to 18,000. And if equity investors  require a return of 8 per                     cent, you would have to conclude that shares are worth  only half their current                     level.                       An 8 per cent expected total return is not ambitious for  an equity investor. A                     day trader might think you were talking about a weekly  profit rather than                     annual. Glassman and Hassett use a figure as low as 5.5  per cent - the return                     on Treasury bonds - because they argue that equities have  so consistently                     outperformed bonds that there is now no risk associated  with equity                     investment. In other words, because equities are sure to  offer higher returns                     than bonds, the expected yield on equities should be the  same as on bonds.                       You do not have to be Wittgenstein to spot the flaw. The  rules of logic hold                     even in cyberspace, and so do the principles of  economics. Profits are hard to                     earn in competitive businesses, and markets that are not  competitive are                     usually regulated. The value of companies ultimately  depends on their                     capacity to generate cash for shareholders. Distant  returns are uncertain.                     Share prices are volatile, and investors need to be  compensated for the risks.                     These truths are as valid in the new economy as the old.                       By all means do the math. Isaac Newton, who could do the  math better than                     most, gave up an annuity of o650 per year to invest in  the South Sea Bubble.                     In addition to the math, you need the econ, the pol, and  perhaps the                     psychology.                       * Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting from the  Coming Rise in the                     Stock Market, James K.

2022-04-10 10:14:49+00:00,true,4,"  Dear Navroz  Thanks for getting back to me.  The reason there has been a dialogue (not, I  should point out, with Nick, but with Shan Millie), is that my work is of  quite a large size, and needs to find an appropriate home.  The question is  should it go into a compilation book, or somehow be published in the  magazine?  I was awaiting some feedback from Risk on the best course of  action.  We were hoping to publish a cut down version in the magazine, and a full  version in Risk's upcoming ""Game Choices"" book, but I've heard nothing from  your organisation until now (and I fear we've now missed the boat on the Game  Choices book deadline).   I'm attaching the full internal Enron document for  your reference, and I'd appreciate your thoughts on how best to put the  article in your journal.  Since the subject is highly diagrammatic, I'm  concerned that 4000 words may be too many when coupled with diagrams!  (It is  currently only 6000 words, but is around 25 A4 pages long.)  If you can give  me some guidance on the issue of publishing extensive diagrams as part of the  text, I'll get to work chopping my work around until it suits your preferred  format.  Shan Millie gave me some good feedback on general points of style and clarity  in my writing, but incorporating these would actually make the article longer  rather than shorter.

Vince      Steven Leppard 04/17/2000 03:50 AM To: Dale Surbey/LON/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Thomas Knudsen  Dale, Vince  As you all know I have attempted to get Thomas Knudsen interviewed as a  result of Prof Lane Hughston's recommendation (Lane is an acquaintance of  Vince and me, and is a very senior figure in the world of quant finance).   Anjam vetoed the idea of interviewing Thomas since he was ""too old and too  experienced"".  Since I felt that Thomas has some merit, I asked Houston to  have an informal chat with Thomas.  Houston wish to pursue the interview  process further, and Anjam has set about setting up the interviews.  I'm  somewhat concerned about the way in which Anjam is going about this, since it  seems he's trying to put up barriers to these interviews.  I received a concerned email from Thomas Knudsen this morning in which he  recounts some strange conversations with Anjam.  He says he received a call  from Anjam on Thursday (13th April) evening (outside office hours), asking  how he got his CV into Enron (I'd shown Anjam the email and CV back in early  February), and how Anjam could contact him (despite the fact he was  contacting him at that moment).  Anjam then called Thomas on his work number (bad form) on Friday 14th asking  Thomas to come in for interviews on Monday (one working day's notice).   Thomas told Anjam he was going on holiday on Wednesday of this week, and that  he'd have to see if he could make time given the need to tidy up some things  at work.  He said he'd contact Anjam on Monday (today) to confirm his  availability.  Today (17th April) Thomas called Anjam to say he couldn't make it, and that  he wouldn't be able to make it for two weeks (not so serious, he thought,  given that we're losing time to Easter anyway).  Anjam told Thomas that the  position might be filled in two weeks' time.  Thomas is concerned about missing the boat, and I for one didn't even realise  it was leaving so soon!  Can anyone shed any light on this?  Steve  ","Steve, I shall talk to Anjam about it. Our impression here in Houston is that Thomas is quite qualified and we are very interested in him.

What I am not sure of is what if any decision  has to be made on May 19.  It seems to me that the Mystic Lady and Elba Island deals  have already been approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or  two.  John    Vince J Kaminski 15/05/2000 17:14 To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rick  Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: LNG May 19 decision    John,  This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.  1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH  and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the  decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island  project (please, see point 2).  2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest  (Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island  transaction. The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions   in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is  meeting to close a few remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.  A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:  a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island  facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.  The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long-term contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are  setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and  coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words, we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.  b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension  option of 5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for  such a long tenor. This is   essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread  and I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.  One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the  first 5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.  c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a  big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market.  d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island  deal (that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions. Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail  that  correlates very well with Brent.

2022-04-10 04:32:14+00:00,true,5,"  Responses: 1.  I'll let Kevin answer this one.  ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.  2.  I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.  If possible I would  like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes  through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas  on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we  are buying back gas at GD - $.01.  3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill  CES directly for this?    4.  See attached worksheets.  5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The  pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing  using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab.   Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she  will recreate Jan - Mar.  6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about  the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about  total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take  additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and  you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as  well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...  This would be a  better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something  specific as it comes up.  The only thing I will not allow you to do is take  gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has  discussed this with Melissa.       dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com on 04/18/2000 09:40:36 AM To: "" - *Chris.Germany@enron.com"" <Chris.Germany@enron.com> cc: "" - *Dalphon, Charles"" <cdalpho@columbiaenergygroup.com>, "" - *Porter,  Jeffrey"" <jporte1@columbiaenergygroup.com>, "" - *Flewellyn, Melissa""  <mflewellyn@columbiaenergygroup.com>  Subject: Questions   Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly. Please look it over and let's talk.  The items are not prioritized in any way.  1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR  the price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I.   The same is true for delivery points into Michcon.   Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7  plus the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon?   Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML-7 as the price index for Michcon.  2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April 1: TCO 6-11, TCO 6-12.   However, because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes  for these two market areas in April 00, CES had to purchase from and resell to Enron 90% of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1.  Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000.   Are we required  to do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense  with this?  I refer you to Section 3.6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency Agreement (p. 11-12) as having some bearing on this issue.  3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are incorrect.  The 4,200 Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume.  Since  the supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend to do a simultaneous ""buy/sell""  with Enron of the volumes in excess of the (erroneous) Exhibit 1 volume.  If you disagree, let's discuss.  4-According to Exhibit 1, CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4-21 (O&R),  TCO 7-3 (West Ohio), TGP Zone 6 (Boston Gas?), would you please  provide me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly  basis for April at each of these points?   (I also need these numbers for January, February, and March.)  5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced?  6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)?   There will undoubtedly be other questions.  I will direct them to you as they arise.  Thanks.  Doug Kinney Ph:  703-561-6339 Fax:  703-561-7317  ","Responses: 1. I'll let Kevin answer this one.

2022-04-10 01:30:56+00:00,true,5,"  I was wondering if this would work:    Problem:  Third party demand reimbursements for transport are kept on  spreadsheets.  I would like to automate this process.    Solution:  Is it possible to enter a capacity ticket with a counterparty  (like ConEd), not a pipeline, and show a negative amount (or the opposite of  what we enter in when we are paying out a charge) therefore resulting in a  credit to the desk for that amount?    Would the system accept such an entry  and would this generate the proper documentation for accounting?  For example, if the East Desk has a deal where ConEd releases capacity to ENA  at max rate, but then reimburses ENA for the demand charge (ENA pays the  commodity costs), the tickets would be entered as follows:  1) a transportation capacity ticket showing demand charges of $.10,  Counterparty = Transco   -   ENA will pay $$$ to the pipeline  2) a transportation capacity ticket showing demand charge of -.10,  Counterparty = Con Ed        -   ENA will receive $$$ from ConEd  It seems like this should work and would eliminate one more manual piece of  this transport p&l.   Please advise.","I was wondering if this would work: Problem: Third-party demand reimbursements for transport are kept on spreadsheets. I would like to automate this process.

The deadline for  submission has been extended until tomorrow (Friday), so there's less of a  hurry.  As regard our summer visits, we'll need to speak to Dale over the budget.   Personal commitments mean it's difficult for me to take two whole months to  visit, so if the cost is prohibitive I may need to make just one shorter  visit.  I'd obviously like to spend longer, and two visits seems to be the  only way I can do it.  I believe the situation is similar for Kirstee.  I've persuaded Richard to pay for Matt's visit in its entirety, and I've no  doubt that RAC/Credit Trading will pick up the bills for Ben and Kirstee.   It's difficult to think who'd be the natural group to pay for me.  I honestly  think I'll have difficulty persuading, e.g. Richard, that it's worth his  while to pay for my visit.  I get the impression he thinks I'm doing OK  without the need to go to Houston for further training.  I'm interviewing a candidate for Bjorn's model review role during today's  videoconference, so we'll need to speak beforehand or perhaps Friday.

2022-04-10 00:19:48+00:00,true,5,"  After reviewing the CIPCO RFP, Enron has questions that we would like to have  answered.  I will call you on Friday to follow-up on these:   1.  Who is Henwood Energy Services and what aspect of the RFP will they  review?  2.  What role will Burns & McDonnell play in the RFP and subsequent project.  3.  Enron controls several development sites in Iowa that provide direct  access into Alliant.  Does CIPCO's transmission arrangements with Alliant  allow for a network service whereby energy injected anywhere into the Alliant  Grid in Iowa can be returned to CIPCO under the present transmission  arrangement.  4.  Enron also controls sites on Mid-Am in Iowa.  Does CIPCO have network  rights on Mid-Am or direct ties with Mid-Am.  Would generation on the Mid-Am  system be of value to CIPCO.  5.  CIPCO states they will consider proposals beyond the 2005 timeframe.  How  many years would CIPCO consider under a transaction where new generation is  being built in a jointly developed project.?  6.  CIPCO states they have reviewed several sites for generation  development.  Can CIPCO provide Enron with a list of preferred sites?  7.  Does CIPCO own separate transmission facilities or is the CIPCO system  assumed to be CIPCO's network transmission contract on the Alliant System?  8.  Would CIPCO consider a project utilizing the General Electric LM-6000  technology as we described in our previous meeting in November 1999.  9.  On a new capital project, would CIPCO finance the project with RUS  financing, internal sources or be interested in financing through Enron?  10.  If Enron is not successful in the RFP and CIPCO elects to build a new  plant, would CIPCO work with Enron to structure a delivered gas supply  transaction whereby Enron would provide a new connecting gas lateral, gas  transportation service and physical gas supply.  I would appreciate you insights on the above.   Thanks  Oscar Dalton odalton@enron.com 713-853-0361    ","5. After reviewing the CIPCO RFP, Enron has questions that we would like to have answered.

2022-04-10 05:55:22+00:00,true,5,"  Because of unique aspects of their language and culture, the Japanese  generally find it far easier to deal with each other than with foreingers.   In some Japanese, this unease can lead to some unappealing attitudes and  behaviors.  The Japanese maintain a very clear distinction between an individual's public  and private faces, so that it is rare to catch them expressing hostile views  of foreigners.  Nevertheless, every now and then, a politician's remarks will  land him in trouble.   You might find the enclosed article interesting.  By the way, Ishihara spent  two weeks denying that he had done anything wrong and only apologized in the  past couple of days.  Regards,    Eugenio         Ishihara acknowledges word was inappropriate                   Yomiuri Shimbun                  Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara late Wednesday acknowledged in a  statement                 that it was ""inappropriate"" for him to have used the word  ""sangokujin"" and                 said that he regrets having caused misunderstanding and  hurting foreigners in                 general by using the derogatory term in a recent speech.                   It was the first time that Ishihara had clearly admitted to  having hurt foreign                 residents by using the word, which has discriminatory  connotations.                 ""Sangokujin"" literally means ""people from third countries.""  Yet it was used                 after World War II as a derisory term for people from former  Japanese                 colonies, primarily Koreans, living in Japan.                   On April 9, he told members of the Ground Self-Defense Forces  in Tokyo                 at a ceremony, ""Atrocious crimes have been committed  repeatedly by                 sangokujin and (other) foreigners who have illegally entered  Japan. It is to                 be expected that they will riot in the event of a major  disaster.""                   Although he used the word to refer to those who have  illegally entered the                 country, it had a different meaning from what he meant to  say, he said.                   ""I did not intend to hurt Korean or other foreign residents  in Japan, and I am                 extremely regretful,"" Ishihara said in the statement,  promising that he would                 never again use the ""inappropriate word,"" which is prone to  cause                 misunderstanding.                   On April 14, he expressed regret over his remarks, but  stopped short of                 acknowledging the derogatory import of the word ""sangokujin""  and failed to                 apologize for having hurt the feelings of foreigners.                   Wednesday's statement was made in response to demands from                 metropolitan assembly members of Minshuto (Democratic Party  of Japan)                 asking that he retract his remarks and make a public apology.                   Ishihara handed the statement to senior Minshuto members of  the assembly                 after they held a meeting earlier in the day.                   The statement, to which Ishihara will affix the governor's  official seal, will                 become an official document.                   Hidejiro Kawai, secretary general of the Minshuto group  within the                 assembly, said, ""An official document carries weight, which  will be                 tantamount to the governor's withdrawal of his remarks and  apology,""                 indicating that the group will not take the matter further.

This meeting will focus on the CGAS storage contract.  What we bill CES for  storage injections will be different than what we actually inject.  April is  a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the  same time.  CGAS only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts.  The  deals in Sitara are set up as CPR Storage for the injections and the  withdrawals.  Which brings up the following issues;  *   How do we bill CES for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with CES  at the storage facility.   Kate Fraser said there were never any BUG buy/sale tickets in Sitara for  storage.  How did that work?  Mark, I'm counting on you for this one.   * How do we track the storage balance in Unify?   * How are the injection/withdrawal cost capture, especially since CGAS will  bill on the net injections/withdrawals  I'm sure there are more issues that will come up during the meeting.

2022-04-10 05:20:28+00:00,true,5,"  As a follow up to the meeting with AA on Friday, April 14, Richard and I  discussed with AA (Sorrells, Grutzmacher and Brown) how the monthly BRM  controller's meeting deliverables and database deliverables should be  prepared.  The proposal I think we should recommend to AA is the following:  Opening and closing meeting with front line managers and discussion of all  items, regardless of priority ratings (high, medium, low) Report generated to the Business Risk Managers at the monthly controller  meeting in the ""Project Doorstep"" style, incorporating existing controls and  observations/action steps to be taken on the critical issues (those with a  high rating) and identify responsible person(s) and target date Follow up matrix report relating to the specific project audited in the  manner consistent with the BRM database indicating priority ratings (the high  issues should match the issues reported in the monthly controller meetings) Eliminate the summary report that has typically be presented at the monthly  controller meetings  Once the ""Project Doorstep"" style report presented by  AA is received at the  monthly controller meeting, compliance will input the issues into the second  database to enable the reminder notifications to be sent to the person(s)  responsible for the action step.  In addition, a monthly progress report will  be generated from compliance to the Business Risk Managers to show the  critical (high) issues and implementation detail, if any.  It will be imperative that AA issue final reports on the projects immediately  after they have been completed and deliver the matrix  within two (2) weeks  after the monthly controller meetings to Compliance for inputting to the BRM  database.  If this information is not received within the two week time  period, compliance will notify the BRM's and AA of the deficiency.  It will also be necessary for you, the Business Risk Managers, to notify your  front line personnel that they will be receiving the email notifications on  action plans with specific target dates and with the expectation that the  responsible persons will be expected to respond to the email with the status  report of the issue.  If you are in agreement with this reporting plan, please indicate so in a  return email message to me and I will coordinate all responses and  communicate this to AA.  I feel that this process will provide the BRM's the  necessary information that you have indicated you want to hear in the  controller's meetings, including the candid discussions as well as provide  compliance with the necessary information to maintain the database so the  information is available for the corporate needs.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at 31939. Thank  you for your attention.

2022-04-10 13:17:14+00:00,true,5,"  Rick:  Just want to provide a summary of our discussion on Wednesday, 4/19/2000  regarding the analyst program and the conclusions reached.  Discussion item #1:  Similarities and differences between the commercial and  commercial services analyst position.  Concluded that the only difference  between the two analyst profiles is the difference in merit and bonus  compensation.  Both have the opportunity to rotate across commercial and  commercial services areas, return to business school after two years, stay  and be promoted either to a commercial services professional position or take  a commercial route and ultimately be promoted to associate.  Agreed:  There is one analyst program and we will immediately eliminate the  compensation differences.  All analysts will receive the same 5K yearly merit  increase and be eligible for the commercial bonus range.  Discussion item #2:  Morale of analysts in program.  Due largely to  compensation differences making the program feel as though it is still two  separate programs.  Commercial services needs more attention and focus.  Need  someone of a Celeste Roberts calibre to focus on the staffing piece.  Agreed:  Eliminating the compensation differences will help boost morale.   Additionally, there needs to be more focus and attention paid to the career  development of analysts.    Discussion item #3:  UT Spring recruiting.  Did not feel there were enough  events and concerned that executive leads were not asked to participate.  Agreed:  Celeste Roberts will follow-up with George Hope and Shelly Jones to  confirm number of events and whether dates were booked on executive lead's  calendars.  Bottom line, we want to ensure that presence on campus is not  minimized.  Discussion item #4:  Off-line discussion with Sally Beck regarding the  Performance Review Process and whether all analysts would be reviewed as one  pool  Agreed:   Per Sally Beck it was agreed that all analysts would be reviewed  together.  We will not separate commercial from commercial services but will  put all analysts on the table and review as one analyst pool.   Please let me know if there are additional items that need to be captured.

The LNG group is working as we speak to provide some information for Joe Sutton before his departure for Paris this (Tuesday) afternoon. There is no DASH on this 2nd tanker yet.

What I am not sure of is what if any decision  has to be made on May 19.  It seems to me that the Mystic Lady and Elba Island deals  have already been approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or  two.  John    Vince J Kaminski 15/05/2000 17:14 To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rick  Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: LNG May 19 decision    John,  This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.  1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH  and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the  decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island  project (please, see point 2).  2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest  (Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island  transaction. The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions   in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is  meeting to close a few remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.  A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:  a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island  facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.  The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long-term contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are  setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and  coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words, we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.  b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension  option of 5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for  such a long tenor. This is   essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread  and I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.  One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the  first 5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.  c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a  big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market.  d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island  deal (that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions. Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail  that  correlates very well with Brent.

2022-04-10 22:31:02+00:00,false,5,"  Message sent from the pjm-customer-info mailing list at  pjm-customer-info@majordomo.pjm.com:   PJM has launched a pilot version of eData which includes data from the New York Independent System Operator.  The beta-test period for the pilot is expected to last approximately 90 days as PJM evaluates the success of using cross-ISO data in eData.  If the pilot proves successful, PJM may add data  from other ISOs in the future.   This pilot version of eData is a result of the collaboration among the ISOs created by the Memorandum of Understanding signed last year.  Through the ISO MOU process, stakeholders have asked the ISOs to improve seams issues, create like user interfaces, and make it easier to do business between the  ISOs. The addition of other ISO data to eData has several benefits to users  including consolidated information, ease of use, less technical support required, and improved customer service.  Real-time prices, forecasted/actual loads, tie  line schedules, and transmission limits are all possible types of information that may be included in the future.   eData was implemented in October 1998.  There are currently more that 1700 registered users representing over 200 companies.  Users include  marketers, utilities, control areas, state and federal regulators, educational organizations, financial institutions and others.  The tool continues to  attract 30 to 40 new registered users each week.  Normally, 100 - 300 users are simultaneously logged onto the system.

2022-04-10 15:05:34+00:00,true,5,"  I have received preliminary information from D&B.  I think several  issues/questions have been raised that if explored, could result in a better  solution for the money.    Option 1 The update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to  monthly for a cost of $87,000 (USD) through March, 2001.  Option 2 I wasn't sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in.  If  you are particularly interested in the Financial Stress Score and Credit  Score, for example, there are multiple alternatives :    2a) Keep quartlery refresh of base data (party name, etc) and refresh scores  that are added/changed on a monthly basis.  Cost - $1.17(USD) per  record.          Note that there are 575,000 records in the file currently  with financial and credit scores, making this potentially a very expensive  alternative          (575,000 X 1.17=$ 672,750).   2b) Batch or FTP updates of the financial and stress scores can only be  provided monthly.  D&B is working on a solution that would provide a  weekly         update to their customers in a batch or FTP manner, but has  not committed to when this will be ready.  Therefore, if more timely updates  than monthly                          are desired, it is also possible to  transactionally access records one at a time using D&B's software.  The cost  for this is extremely high at $10.52         (USD) per score.   Option 3 D&B Connect Product.  D&B Connect is a tool set of matching software, an externally validated  reference file, credit and marketing information, and D&B services that  enables the  most effective integration of customer information and  third-party information with D&B information.  Only this type of process and  information integration  capability can facilitate and ensure accurate  identification, linkage and maintenance of your customer's complete  relationship.   In addition, D&B Connect  assures organizations of  referential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to D&B so  that the most recent D&B information is always  transmitted to your  organization and updated within your local D&B Connect Reference File.  D&B  Connect is scalable.     Cost Typically ranging from  * Customer Access Module (CAM) Batch- - $25,000  * CAM Online - $50,000  * Full Information Integrator - $350,000 + data  With more specifics as to your needs, this option should perhaps be pursued.   Questions/Issues  1) D&B had questions regarding the use of their data and whether Enron  customers would be offered this information for a fee or free.  I explained  that I  did not feel the data would be offered directly to Enron customers,  but that it would be used to support analysis that would be available  externally via web  site, etc.  All pricing above is based upon this  understanding.  If I have not portrayed the usage correctly, it will be  imperative to get a better understanding  before final pricing can be  negotiated.  2)  Are there specific data elements that you are interested in ?   Alternatives may vary by data element.  Financial Stress Score and Credit  Score reference  above were explored as an example.  3)  What is timeframe for needing a solution ?  4)  Financial Stress Score and Credit Score are only available on U.S.  companies.  A comparable measure - Global Failure Score (the liklihood of  default or  bankruptcy)  is available for international companies.  This  rating score however, is NOT currently available via a batch or FTP manner.   This could result  in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this  score in a batch manner.  5)  Pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit  analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes.  This is  probably  negotiable as the data is the same.  The thought process is that if  the repository is used for credit or risk decisions, D&B will see decreased  usage and  revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments.   If you would like me to follow up further, please give me a call at  713-853-6079.  ","I have received preliminary information from D&B.

'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current  gas day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was  in fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect  to the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that  we take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume' shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be  negotiated.

2022-04-10 04:36:15+00:00,true,5,"  To ensure everyone is on the same page.... Steve Stonestreet at TCO and I had  a conversation on how TCO works its storage ratchets. Steve, if I have  misstated something, please let us know.  There is a FSS schedule that tells the ratchets, minimum injections, maximum  withdrawals, etc. This FSS schedule has been updated in the attached  spreadsheet with Enron's SCQ and Enron's MDSQ, which enables Enron to know  its different volume requirements.  Based on the attached schedule, each month there are different Maximum  Monthly Injection Quantities (MMIQ)  based on Enron's SCQ. There is no  Minimum Injection Quantity required by TCO.  TCO Injection Session and % of SCQ;  April = 15% May = 20% June = 20% July = 20% Aug = 20% Sept = 13% Oct = 7 %  If you add these months up, the total Injection is 115%. Essentially,  shippers have an extra 15% that does not have to be used during the injection  period. Please note, Shippers can inject all year around on TCO (November is  5% and December through March is 10%... typically not done).  For example, Shippers do not have to inject the ratchet amount in April  (15%). If the Shipper falls behind on the STOI, and the Shipper needs to  catch up on STOI in the future months, and the Shipper wants to go over the  ratchet level for that month, then TCO will need to give its prior approval  (I sound like a lawyer). Typically, TCO is more willing to approve  overinjections in the early months of the injection session versus  overinjecting in September and October, when TCO is full.    Some other basic rules;  Shippers do not have to fill storage 100% by October.  Shippers cannot have more than  60% in storage by June 1st, unless  overinjection is approved by TCO.  Shippers can have daily net withdrawals in the summer, and it works the same  way it did in the Winter. Depending on the % SCQ, this will determine the  MDWQ. As of today, 8.3% is in the ground so Enron can net withdraw 54,324.  Once Enron is between 10% to 20%, then the MDWQ is 70,521... but remember  Enron's SST is only 54,324 until October 1st... so other transport will need  to be used to avoid overrun charges.   Why do we care about all of this....  Enron wants to slow down on the injection into storage. Because choice still  uses storage withdrawal in April and storage withdrawal is used for  Hopewell... there may be days that we are net withdrawing. As long as we stay  below 54,324... there will not be penalties. If we go over this amount, we  will need to get gas controls approval... the same drill we use for  overinjections above 36,304.  TCO Schedulers... we have been doing a great job monitoring this so far.  April is a very hard month to monitor storage. Remember, if we have problems  running Storage reports from our PC's or Laptops, TCO has the ability to run  the reports and TCO will run it on the weekends if necessary. From these  reports, we can determine if we need to get the overwithdrawal or  overinjection approval from TCO's Gas Control. TCO's gas control will need a  volume amount to place in their book... which is the bible for TCO enforcing   penalties. The penalties are pretty steep... max is $10 dkt.  Please save this note for future reference.           ","To ensure everyone is on the same page.... Steve Stonestreet at TCO and I had a conversation on how TCO works its storage ratchets.

2022-04-10 04:10:04+00:00,true,5,"  Charlene:  Outlined below are the points I promised to send you before our  meeting on Wednesday morning.  I don't know your agenda for the meeting, so  it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow.    Background:  As a long-time supporter of the analyst program, I became  concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other  supporters of the program.   Many of those expressing frustration are heavily  involved in the recruiting process.   It is their commitment to both  recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting  talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program.   I initiated a meeting, announced at Rick Causey's staff meeting, that would  bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss  them with you in a constructive manner.  Our intent is continued support and  improvement of the program.   The meeting took place on March 28 and included  the following:   Brenda Herod   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - LSU   Brent Price  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT     Jeff Sommers  CALME    Executive Lead - Univsersity of Florida   Ed Coats  Corp. Tax    Core Team Member - UT, A&M, LSU and University of  Florida   Sally Beck  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT and OU   Carolyn Barrett  EBS       Howard Selzer  Enron Global E&P    Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points:  One program, or two:  Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999, an  announcement  was made that there would be one analyst program.  Not much  materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be  managed.  In fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw  that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and  differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation.  We  feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program  on campus.   SIngle start date:  The single start date of July 17 for analysts is  impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an  innovative company.  The July start date does not consider December graduates  and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in  May.    Lack of communication:   We are some of the most involved and committed  senior managers in the MSAP, and yet we have received little information or  communication about the program.   We hear rumors of ""tracks"", but no facts  or details.  Some of us had heard about the single July start date, and some  had not.    Commercial focus too heavy:  Presentation materials, the attitudes of support  staff in the Associates/Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily  focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs.  Lack of input from biggest supporters:  Given the time and effort that many  of us put into the MSAP, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join  with you in some of your plans for the program.   We are concerned that  decisions (example:  the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum  without what could be some valuable input from some of us.    MSAP has taken a step backward:  Previously, with a dedicated leadership team  and staff, the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on  campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top  candidates and the pride of participants in the program.  We feel that the  focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and  we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program.     Summary Concerns/Discussion Points:  Disc   ","Charlene: Outlined below are the points I promised to send you before our meeting on Wednesday morning.

2022-04-10 21:50:09+00:00,true,5,"  Reviewed by Mark Williams, SVP Risk Management, Citizens Power  The long awaited second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk has finally arrived. It has been four years since the first edition was published. During this hiatus, a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline. The second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics.  The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity. As expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges, which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope. It includes a lengthy introduction that effectively frames risk management progress, advancements and innovations that started in the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to the natural gas and most recently expanding to the electricity industry.  Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15 chapters, all of which include an introduction, which minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from a book written by a large number of authors. Other improvements in this second edition include expanded graphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and a separate glossary, which provides the reader with additional reference material.  In particular the chapter on energy options written by Michael Hampton is a useful primer and provides the reader with a concise explanation of option theory, pricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practical guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure speculation. For the more advanced reader, the chapter on Energy Exotic Options, written by Vince Kaminski, Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni is particularly strong as it outlines the challenges associated with the exotics and effectively documents the latest methods used by leading practitioners in pricing such instruments.  Additionally, the chapter on Accounting for Derivative Contracts in the Energy Environment by three consultants from Arthur Anderson, is a well written summary which addresses the numerous tax related issues including a timely discussion on the US Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement 133 (see EPRM October 1999, page 22). Having this tax information housed in one concise chapter is of great value.  The second edition however is not without flaws. In particular, it would have been useful to have more information on the current challenges risk managers are confronted with in the power industry including latest advancements in volatility and correlation estimation techniques. Additional attention could have also been placed on the shortcomings of the current market structure and methods in finding and applying appropriate hedging strategies and instruments. In the fledgling power market, this continues to be one of the primary challenges.  In summary, this second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the new recruit or seasoned veteran. It is a welcome edition to any risk management library. ","Reviewed by Mark Williams, SVP Risk Management, Citizens Power. The long awaited second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk has finally arrived, and it has been four years since the first edition was published. It has been a long hiatus in management, as it reinforces the fact that"

Here is some information you will need when 'wooing' them.  The first annual Global Conference will be held at the Rice Hotel in downtown  Houston on June 15th and June 16th.  The theme of the conference is  'Foundations of ""One Enron"".'  A review of Global Data  Management's(Counterparty, Contracts, Facilities, Rates, Entelligence) role  in the development and support of central information regarding Enron's  customers and relationships and plans for expanding that role will be  discussed.  Many topics will re-inforce worldwide initiatives, communication  between business units, and learning to leverage knowledge and expertise from  multiple sources. There will also be a special workshop session on  multi-cultural awareness to prepare our teams for working in a global  environment.    And then you say..... ""Mary and I would like to feature you as a distinguished speaker, so you may  relate to Mary's team and conference attendees why consistent global  information is so important to Enron.

There are three  worksheets labelled as follows:  'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".    The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed  at a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network. 'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current  gas day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was  in fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect  to the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that  we take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume' shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be  negotiated.

There are three  worksheets labelled as follows:  'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".    The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed  at a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network. 'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current  gas day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was  in fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect  to the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that  we take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume' shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be  negotiated. 'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the ""Daily Change' worksheet.   Omitted pending resolution of TCO storage issues.

I'll let Kevin answer this one.  ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.  2.  I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.  If possible I would  like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes  through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas  on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we  are buying back gas at GD - $.01.  3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill  CES directly for this?    4.  See attached worksheets.  5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The  pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing  using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab.   Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she  will recreate Jan - Mar.  6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about  the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about  total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take  additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and  you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as  well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...  This would be a  better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something  specific as it comes up.  The only thing I will not allow you to do is take  gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has  discussed this with Melissa.      dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com on 04/18/2000 09:40:36 AM To: "" - *Chris.Germany@enron.com"" <Chris.Germany@enron.com> cc: "" - *Dalphon, Charles"" <cdalpho@columbiaenergygroup.com>, "" - *Porter,  Jeffrey"" <jporte1@columbiaenergygroup.com>, "" - *Flewellyn, Melissa""  <mflewellyn@columbiaenergygroup.com>  Subject: Questions   Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly. Please look it over and let's talk.  The items are not prioritized in any way.  1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR  the price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I.   The same is true for delivery points into Michcon.   Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7  plus the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon?   Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML-7 as the price index for Michcon.  2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April 1: TCO 6-11, TCO 6-12.   However, because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes  for these two market areas in April 00, CES had to purchase from and resell to Enron 90% of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1.  Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000.   Are we required  to do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense  with this?  I refer you to Section 3.6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency Agreement (p. 11-12) as having some bearing on this issue.  3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are incorrect.  The 4,200 Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume.  Since  the supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend to do a simultaneous ""buy/sell""  with Enron of the volumes in excess of the (erroneous) Exhibit 1 volume.  If you disagree, let's discuss.  4-According to Exhibit 1, CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4-21 (O&R),  TCO 7-3 (West Ohio), TGP Zone 6 (Boston Gas?), would you please  provide me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly  basis for April at each of these points?   (I also need these numbers for January, February, and March.)  5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced?  6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)?   There will undoubtedly be other questions.  I will direct them to you as they arise.  Thanks.

2022-04-10 21:10:52+00:00,true,5,"  John,  This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.  1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH  and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the  decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island  project (please, see point 2).  2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest  (Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island  transaction. The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions   in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is  meeting to close a few remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.  A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:  a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island  facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.  The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long-term contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are  setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and  coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words, we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.  b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension  option of 5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for  such a long tenor. This is   essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread  and I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.  One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the  first 5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.  c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a  big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market.  d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island  deal (that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions. Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail  that  correlates very well with Brent.

I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH  and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the  decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island  project (please, see point 2).  2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest  (Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island  transaction. The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions   in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is  meeting to close a few remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.  A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:  a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island  facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.  The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long-term contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are  setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and  coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words, we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.  b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension  option of 5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for  such a long tenor. This is   essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread  and I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.  One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the  first 5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.  c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a  big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market.  d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island  deal (that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions. Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail  that  correlates very well with Brent.

2022-04-10 19:26:02+00:00,true,5,"  Brad,  As we discussed, it's very difficult to find drivers of the ENE stock's  behaviours.  We investigated about 30 comparable stocks, 10 capital market  indices, and three energy commodity indices.  Regular regressions as well as  regressions with different legs and leads were performed.  Some variables  show significant correlated with ENE stock during particular time periods,  but most of those correlation disappears when we tested them over different  or longer time periods.   Only two variables, S&P Utility Index(SPXU) and  DOW Jones Utility  Index(UTIL), show stable and significant relationship with ENE stock (a  summary of these relationship can be found in the attached file  ""outputSummary"").  But as you can see, the R2 are below 30%.  Also, the ?Durbin-Watson statistics tell us to be careful about autocorrelation.?Basically, the regression analysis so far confirms our original opinion -- ?it's hard, if not impossible, to find out any real driver of the ENE stock.  ?After Enron added new core business several month ago, the stock behaved more ?or less like a tele_comm stock,  which suggests that ENRON stock has entered ?into a new phase.  To capture, at least  trying to capture,  its ?characteristics in the new phase, we need a lit bit more time to cumulate the ?market date.??Let me know if you need me investigate more variables or you come up with ?some new thoughts.????Vincent??

2022-04-10 21:45:06+00:00,true,5,"  Thanks for the comments Grant.  The presentation is for a couple of external  conferences that Vince volunteered me for - Vince has OK'd the content, and  Stinson raised exactly the same issues as you.  Unfortunately I just don't  seem to be getting any response from RISK whatsoever on the publication of my  article, so these conferences will be the public debut for my real options  notation.  Of course the discounting/risk neutrality thing is where the real judgement  sits.  When questions arise I'll take the line that while Research formulates  the models using appropriate derivatives/market based valuation methods, we  work with our RAC group which considers the discounting to be associated with  various risks, and chooses these rates appropriately.  The notation makes  clear which uncertainties we are exposed to at different stages of the deals,  which assists in choosing the rates.  In practice I'm not yet at the stage where originators are using my notation  yet - another reason I can't say too much about its actual use at the  conference.  I'm producing various tools for deterministic hydro  optimization, GBM swing option valuation, and deterministic DP optimization  for genset dispatch which people want right now - I'm working in the  background on the kind of modelling my notation demands.  People are getting  to know me as a guy who can solve their immediate problems, and they'll be  more likely to listen when  I start rolling out the ""proper"" options-based  models.  My notation is currently used only in the specs I'm writing for the  tools I'm producing.  I'll be turning Dale's spreadsheet-based power plant spread model into an  American Monte Carlo tool, which will then be available for inclusion in  other models.  I think by the end of the summer the real options theoretical  work will start to bear fruit, one year after I initially proposed the  notation.  With the quant IT group I'm co-creating in place, I may yet see  the automated diagramming/pricing tool made real.  Thanks also for the pointer to Tom Halliburton.  The use of the LINGO  LP/integer package is something I've been presented with for the Teesside  plant operation optimizer, rather than something I chose.  The PERM (Physical  Energy Risk Mgt) group just got a couple of analysts to hack it together  (including Natasha Danilochkina), then asked me to tidy it up when it didn't  work.  They are going to use their existing faulty model for now (to meet  their project deadlines), and I'm sketching out a proper mathematical spec  for the problem.  I've persuaded (!) them that this sort of business-critical system should be  developed properly by Research, and they now seem happy to fall into line.   Their Wilton plant optimizer was developed by one Peter Morawitz, the guy I  hoped to recruit into Research, and they obviously didn't realise he was  better than average at quantitative modelling.  Anyway they now accept that  doing it properly will take months rather than weeks, and I'll have a freer  hand in my choice of modelling tool - so a chat with Tom would be extremely  valuable.

Zhiyong Wei is the IT Director in Houston who is responsible for  Enpower development.  We are working with Pablo and Zhiyong on several  possibilities.  As we have previously discussed, there is not the current  capability to value the spreads as options, but we are testing the other  scenarios.

After speaking with Zhiyong, there evidently was  a big push last year for the MTM of Transmission.  The latest version has  been in the test environment for some time, but no one is currently testing  it.  It will take some attention to test it properly and will not be complete  by the book-split deadline.  As we established in our last meeting, the MTM of transmission is a separate  project from the book-split.

2022-04-10 07:37:35+00:00,true,6,"  BNA Environment Reporter  Oil, Ethanol Industries Far From Deal On Pending Senate Bill to Limit MTBE   Oil and ethanol interests remain at odds as the Senate seeks to limit use of  the fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), making it uncertain  whether the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will be able to  craft an acceptable national solution to the problem of MTBE in water, lobbyists told BNA April 17-19.  Despite fundamental differences, however, all sources interviewed for this  story--including two oil industry officials, three ethanol advocates, and  several other sources active in the legislative process on this issue--said  that it still appeared possible that national MTBE legislation satisfying  multiple interests could be developed.  ""I don't think we're at an impasse,"" one oil industry official said, echoing  comments by others in the debate. ""I just think it's going to take time.""  Whether this means that a compromise can be worked out during this  legislative session remains to be seen, this official and others said.  The committee chairman, Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.), has made MTBE a priority,  saying that Congress must eliminate the threat of water contamination posed  by the fuel oxygenate while being careful to preserve the air quality  benefits associated with MTBE-mixed gasoline.  The chairman's view of the issue, however, is contrary to the view held by  the Clinton administration, by ranking minority member Sen. Max Baucus  (D-Mont.), and by Democratic and Republican agricultural interests in the  Senate. These forces hold that corn-derived ethanol and possibly other  ""renewable"" fuels should gain a wider market under any legislation addressing  the threat of MTBE water contamination.  The oil industry and Smith disagree with that view.  Smith Rejects 'Renewables' Linkage  When the Clinton administration announced on March 20 its support for a  national renewable fuels mandate, Smith said ""the issue of renewable fuels  has absolutely nothing to do with eliminating MTBE from our drinking water.""  He repeated this point in a newspaper opinion piece April 10.  In addition to gasoline and ethanol advocates, several other interest groups  maintain an active role in the ongoing debate, and Senate committee staff ar  continuing behind-the-scenes meetings with all sides, sources said.  Generally, comprehensive MTBE legislation is expected to slash use of the  additive without necessarily eliminating it entirely. A committee bill also  is expected to provide states with the option of waiving the Clean Air Act  mandate currently driving the use of MTBE and ethanol, another fuel oxygenate. At the same time, such a bill is  expected to include ""no backsliding"" language to ensure that air toxics  reductions achieved in the eastern United States over the last several years  are maintained even if states waive out of the air act mandate.  Sources said the committee also is weighing possible cleanup liability relief  for MTBE producers and enhancements to fuel storage tank clean up programs.  Heavy Reliance on MTBE  MTBE is a high-oxygen, high-octane gasoline additive that is one of the most  heavily produced chemicals in the United States. With roughly 12 million  gallons of MTBE mixed with gasoline each day in the United States, the  chemical makes up more than 3 percent of gasoline by volume, according to the  oil industry.  MTBE use is driven mainly by the Clean Air Act requirement that all  ""reformulated gasoline"" contain at least 2 percent oxygen by weight.  Reformulated gasoline is sold in areas of the country with poor air quality.  According to the Environmental Protection Agency, more than 80 percent of  reformulated gasoline production relies on MTBE to meet the oxygen  requirement.  However, MTBE smells somewhat like turpentine and has been detected in public  water supplies, rendering at least a few of those supplies undrinkable. The  health effects of drinking MTBE in water are little known, but the chemical  does taste and smell bad, according to a February report by the Congressional  Research Service.  RFG programs in Chicago and Milwaukee rely on ethanol for oxygen content in  their reformulated gasoline. Among other concerns in the legislative debate,  the ethanol industry fears losing this market if Congress eliminates the 2  percent oxygen requirement in the Clean Air Act to address MTBE concerns, one  industry representative said.  There were 1.5 billion gallons of ethanol mixed into gasoline in 1999,  according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. USDA chief economist Keith  Collins said before the Senate Agricultural Committee April 11 that there are  55 ethanol plants in operation in ""nearly 20 states.""  Bill Would Ease 2 Percent Oxygen Rule  To address water quality concerns, Smith has signed on to legislation (S.  1886) that would allow states to lift the 2 percent mandate driving MTBE use.  Introduced by Inhofe and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), S. 1886 would not  ban or phase down MTBE outright. However, this is expected to change when and  if the Environment and Public Works committee marks up more comprehensive  legislation, oil, ethanol, and other sources said.  ""I think there's a growing set of opinion ... that MTBE either needs to be  phased down to historic levels or phased out entirely over a period of some  years,"" an oil industry source said.  Chemical companies that make MTBE disagree and continue to urge an overhaul  of underground storage tank programs in order to mitigate water contamination.  According to one source familiar with the issue, Senate committee staff  members are considering several legislative ideas that might address concerns  of MTBE interests. Prospective liability relief from contamination cleanup  costs is under consideration, as is the idea that MTBE makers should get  expedited review of required permits when switching to alternate chemical  products.  In addition, the committee may be considering more rigorous regulation of  underground storage tanks as part of comprehensive MTBE legislation, this  source said.  Daschle, Harkin Drafts  At least 14 bills have been introduced in the 106th Congress to address the  problem of MTBE in water, according to the Congressional Research Service  report. The report said most bills would either eliminate the Clean Air Act  requirement driving oxygenate use or would explicitly ban MTBE.  Some of the bills would bolster the Environmental Protection Agency's  underground storage tank program since leaking USTs are considered the main  cause of water contamination. This approach is supported by certain MTBE  makers, who told BNA that water contamination is caused by leaking tanks and  not by the high-quality fuel additive.  Additional draft bills are pending introduction, including comprehensive  legislation by Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the Senate minority leader, that  would significantly curtail MTBE use by 2004 while letting states take action  before then.  Daschle's bill--said by Baucus's staff to be supported by the ranking EPW  committee member--also would bolster ethanol production through a national  renewable fuels mandate, expanding national average ethanol use to 2 percent  or more over the next 10 years.  In addition, the draft legislation would amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act  to get states the money they need to implement UST cleanup programs.  Ethanol supporter Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) also is drafting MTBE legislation  that he hopes to introduce soon after the Senate's Easter recess, a  spokeswoman said. Harkin is ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture  Committee and supports a renewable fuels standard. ""If crafted in the right  way,'' Harkin has said, such a standard ""could result in far more ethanol use  than current law.""  Iowa ranks second after Illinois in total ethanol production capacity,  according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Nebraska ranks third and  Minnesota ranks fourth.  RFG Market  Despite calls for eliminating the 2 percent oxygenate requirement in the  reformulated gasoline program, ethanol interests said they still support  maintenance of the requirement combined with an MTBE ban.  Such a scenario would leave ethanol to fill the RFG market void, doubling  ethanol use over three to five years, sources said. If Congress were to  eliminate the 2 percent mandate but institute a national renewable fuels  requirement, ethanol use also is expected to at least double from current  levels. However, it would do so over a longer period of about 10 years, one  ethanol source said.  Oil industry officials, as well as Northeast states and some environmental  advocates, oppose this simple MTBE ban because it would create a ""de facto  ethanol mandate."" The oil industry also continues to oppose a national  renewable fuels standard, officials said.  A representative of Northeast states told a Senate panel April 11 that Smith  appeared to be exploring a compromise with ethanol interests, considering a  national average ""alternative fuel"" requirement that would benefit ethanol as  well as natural gas, electricity, and other transportation fuels.  The Northeast representative, Jason Grumet of Northeast States for  Coordinated Air Use Management, supports the national average, alternative  fuel approach, since it would offer the ethanol industry market share without  requiring the Northeast to use large quantities of Midwest-derived ethanol.  However, oil company interests reaffirmed April 17 their long-held opposition  to any new fuel mandates, saying concerns over MTBE in water should be  addressed by eliminating current statutory mandates and not by instituting  any new mandates.  Oil companies are particularly firm in their position given that agricultural  states are expected to play a key role in upcoming presidential elections, a  second oil industry official said. It is not simply that the industry opposes  new mandates--though that is the case--but also that an ethanol-mandate ""bidding war"" might erupt in a  year when  Republicans and Democrats are vying for Midwestern votes, the  official said.  Ethanol Supporters Want Expansion  Meanwhile, ethanol interests said they will continue to fight for expansion  of their product in the RFG market, and do not necessarily see a national  renewable fuels mandate as a legislative compromise.  The Clinton administration's renewable standard would require ethanol use  initially at current levels of about 1.2 percent of gasoline. The mandate  would then expand over 10 years, administration officials have said.  Ethanol is more volatile than MTBE, making it more difficult for oil refiners  to produce summertime gasoline that meets low emissions requirements for  volatile organic compounds. This is one reason the ""de facto mandate"" is  opposed by Northeast states and environmental interests. Some of the  renewables mandates under consideration in Congress would allow refiners to  meet requirements over an annual average, enabling them to avoid or reduce  their ethanol use in summer.  No Markup Scheduled  Smith staff confirmed only that discussions with oil, ethanol, environmental,  MTBE, and state interests continue. A spokesman said comprehensive MTBE  legislation ""is something we're trying to get done quickly,"" but that a bill  markup has not been scheduled.  Discussions leading to a full EPW committee markup of more comprehensive MTBE  legislation are important to the legislative process, sources said, because a  bill is not expected to weather floor debate without early support from  Democrats and Republicans on the committee, as well as from members of the  Senate Agricultural Committee.  ""I just can't see this getting duked out on the floor,"" said one ethanol  lobbyist. ""I think that we, the MTBE folks, the oil company folks, and the  environmentalists all recognize that there is mutually assured destruction on  the floor.""  According to one source, a new version of the bill is expected to push MTBE  use down to pre-1990 levels over about four years. Before the 1990 air act  amendments required the sale of reformulated gasoline, MTBE was used mainly  to enhance octane.  It is unclear whether the bill will somehow prove acceptable to both  Democrats and Republicans, ethanol and oil interests, as well as to Northeast  states, the Midwest, and California.  ""Things change day to day,"" an oil industry official said. ""I think the issue  could be resolved without the ethanol piece, but the ethanol piece is just so  difficult,"" he added.  ""I think right now the chairman is poking around in the mud to find somewhere  with solid footing,"" an ethanol industry source said.","BNA Environment Report: Oil, Ethanol Industries Far From Deal On Pending Senate Bill to Limit MTBE Oil and ethanol interests remain at odds as the Senate seeks to limit the fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), making it uncertain whether"

Location: Vicksburg, MS sharing a site with the Baxter Wilson plant (1320 MW  coal/gas fired boiler) HHV: 12,200 btu/kwh Pipe: A new intra-state that will be shared with the Baxter Wilson plant.   Existing sources are Koch and Duke. Start date: 7/01 Permits: PSD permit at 9 ppm.  No run hour limitation. Taxes: Fee in lieu of taxes at 1/3 cost for first ten years.  Full property  taxes thereafter.  Entergy claims this is the same deal Ben Jacoby got for  our peaker in MS.  First we need to model a pro-forma of plant operating costs using estimates  of FOM and VOM from internal sources. Second, we need to calculate spread option valuations of the underlying plant  for 20-years using curve, vol and correlation assumptions acceptable to the  desk.

My theory, which is based on our  experience with the Gallup compressor, is that we could enter into a joint  ownership and operating agreement with Agave, and as long as we convince the  Commission that the agreements give TW sufficient control over the operation  of the facility to ensure FERC regs are complied with, they will be OK with  the joint ownership -- and not try to assert jurisdiction over Agave (a  gathering company).

I am working on a detailed comprehensive plan of action to enact the changes  we discussed re the settlement and confirmations procedures transfer. Due to  the volume of work that was on my desk upon my return this is not coming  together quite as quickly as I would like and therefore we are going to have  to look at it piece by piece.   We need to issue a new authorised signatory list this week for Enron  Australia Energy and Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd due to changes in the  dealer structure and therefore we have decided that this would be a good  opportunity to make the change to the approval of confirmations.   As agreed, we will have Sydney office take over responsibility for signing  all confirmations. This means they are still prepared in Sydney, as they are  now, with the change of procedure being that they will now be signed in  Sydney and faxed from here to our clients. The primary signatories will be  the Managing Director (Paul Quilkey) or the Chief Financial Officer (Heidi  Mason). In the event of both being unavailable they will be signed by the  Senior Legal Counsel (David Minns).   The confirmation log will be maintained in its entirety by Sydney Office and  will be held in a directory accessible by Houston. This will allow  independent audit review to occur as required.   In order to implement this change we have prepared a new authorised  signatories list which we are planning to distribute at the end of this week.  In the meantime could you please advise of what action needs to be taken in  Houston to ensure all the relevant areas are advised. Clearly a  key  individual will be Sue Frusco. When I met with Sue in Houston we discussed  briefly the fact that you and I had agreed that invoicing and confirmations  would move to Sydney but at that stage there was no timing raised.

2022-04-10 05:13:01+00:00,true,6,"  Lynn:   I think there is wisdom in seeking to separate money from terms at this  point. If TW and TNN reach an agreement on money. Then, in some sense, TNN  will be counting on this money and there should be some pressure to reach a  final agreement so that the money can be paid. This may cause some  flexibility on terms. If we are trying to negotiate both money and terms at  the same time, the sovereignty zealots can argue, ""they (TW) haven't even  agreed to a ""fair"" consideration, and now they want to take our sovereignty.""   It has been said that ""when money goes out the door, love goes out the  window."" Perhaps the converse is true.   A final thought is that I am aware of the Standing Rock scenario where an  agreement on consideration was reached first and then the deal fell apart on  the question of terms. While my knowledge of all the details is not complete,  it is my understanding that in that case, (unlike the present situation), it  was not made crystal clear to TNN that the Standing Rock terms still needed  negotiation. Moreover, I am not sure that in Standing Rock you had the  participation of a TNN Task Force that included Navajo Nation Council  Committee Chairs (who should furnish the impetus for completing a deal and  getting the money once consideration is agreed on.)

2022-04-10 17:26:54+00:00,true,6,"  I think this same memo is on the EBB several times.  FYI                                                           May 9, 2000 9:40 a.m.   Dear West Virginia Producer,  Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you  more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our  gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into  our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited  number  of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity  somewhat more widely available to the producers.  For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000, the Gathering  and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its Craig,  Yellow Creek and Schultz compressor stations.  The Dominion ""bubbles""  affected  are 3219, 3223 and 3224 for the Schultz area and 3214, 3215, 3216, 3217,  3218,  3220, 3221 and 3222 for Craig station and 3208, 3209, 3210, 3211, 3212 and  3213 for Yellow Creek station.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there  does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor  stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression  agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the  existing compressors.  Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the  applications  it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably  interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering  the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the  Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the  amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement.  Dominion  recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time  frames. We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the  application  process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once  granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within  six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will  award the rights on a prorated basis.  Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include  the  incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression  agreement.

In continuing with  that process to bring you more value for your local production and to  improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved.   We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past,  and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to  the producers.  For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:   For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000,  the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas  feeding the Barbour County High Pressure System.  The Dominion ""bubble"" affected is 4205.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor  stations. The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements  will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the  pipeline system.

2022-04-10 22:21:57+00:00,true,6,"  Thanks for the summary. I was out last week so apologies if my comments  arrive too late. Here they are anyway:   1 Socrates  I think it inappropriate for me, or anyone in RAC for that matter, to have  primary responsibility for this system/project.  But if I were responsible the first thing I would want to know is why this  project, which commenced in May 1998, as I recall, is still incomplete, given  that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in  history, concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart.   2 Exhaustive ?  It doesn't look like an exhaustive list and I suspect it was not intended to  be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such.    3 Symptoms or Causes ?  Many of the points look like the former, and addressed as they stand will  likely leave us with a Band-aid solution which will drop off when pressure is  applied.  In fact many of them look like they are a result of Point 5 :    ""Prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control  functionality...""  because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten, confirmation  errors get made, deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright  people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think  about changing the way they work. And, for example, when those people move  on, as they surely will, the institution has no memory of how to do what they  did.   I am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on  Microsoft Excel all day, everyday.    4 Overall  I think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way. Rather  than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking  off, we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate.  As a hypothesis, if most issues stem from Point 5, then I would ask why has  prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control  functionality ?

Burns & McDonald has assisted in site selection/review and will  participate in evaluation of any self-builds that CIPCO does.  3.  CIPCO has a preference to purchase from the market or from plants that  Enron would develop.  They are not big on wanting to build their own plant or  JV.  4.  CIPCO has identified a key site in Iowa that has direct access to their  own system as well as the Mid-Am system.  They would make that site available  to us if we needed it.  They will not reveal the site unless we get into  negotiations.  5.  CIPCO will consider terms longer than 5 years.  They would consider a  15-20 year term if there was a capital project involved.  6.  CIPCO does have their own transmission system as well as point/point  transmission agreements on Mid-Am and Alliant.  The point to point agreement  are from plants where CIPCO owns a partial share to CIPCO's system.  7.  CIPCO appeared to not value the LM-6000 technology to any higher degree  than other machines.  8.  CIPCO was not sure of how things would be financed.  9.

We are still under several different CA's with them,  due to our past conversation's regarding generation.    With our previous discussions, Rich Kinder had suggested to Kevin Hannon if  Enron would be interested in buying the whole Orion  Project, but at that  time ENA was only interested in the first couple of projects, due to the  delivery of the turbines.    In light of our past discussions and KMI's desire to exit the generation  business, this JV would give them the perfect ""exit strategy"".  Also, it  would give us a better growth strategy, with respects to our talks with other  parties.  I know that bringing in a potential third party would complicate  the deal structure, but I think that it would build a much better growth  story to Wall Street.

Checked with Baird and his initial view is  that we should say something in the form of an additional release if Monday  comes and we can't complete our Q.  He will discuss with Rex and give me  final input as soon as possible.  I know this isn't a desirable result, but  Bob thinks we'd be worse off if we said nothing---and then waited for people  to call us.  We wouldn't need to say much, just something to the effect that  we are continuing to work through the open integration issues, etc.  The  specific wording would have to be worked out internally.

I do  appreciate, however, the tremendous effort everyone has made to identify and  fix the problems that keep surfacing.  At times like these, it is human nature to place the blame.  Such an exercise  is pointless.  In my opinion, there were a lot of things that we would ALL do  differently if we had the chance to do them over again.  The important issues now are:  Let's get it right; let's learn from our mistakes; let's recognize that we have to work as a team to accomplish 1. and 2. above;  and, let's appreciate how our job performance impacts the performance of the team.  Also, let's not forget that the commercial trends are favorable.  We appear  poised to turn the corner.  Stabilizing our systems, getting good regional  profit and loss data, which will improve our commercial decision-making,  coupled with aggressive cost reductions, will get us to the promised-land.

2022-04-10 03:15:29+00:00,true,6,"  Stan:  I have not talked directly with Coastal about their specific approach, but am  aware of efforts to find tax relief for conversion of MTBE facilities to  alkalytes.   This is also an option that has been discussed in the OFA and  MTBE Producer groups.   It certainly could be a viable ""fallback"" position to  stranded cost recovery.  However, Coastal is very differently situated than Enron in terms of stranded  costs or liability protection.   Refiners can't make as good a case for  stranded costs as the merchant producers of MTBE who developed unique  facilites directly in response to the Clean Air Act oxygenate mandate.   On  liability protection, refiners and marketers are more directly responsible  for groundwater contamination with MTBE because they have the leaking tanks  -- so they have what could be characterized as ""contributory negligence"",  where MTBE producers do not.  I agree with Steve Kean's response -- going after liability protection is  probably going to be more viable than finding stranded costs.   We will keep  pressing both issues, and distinguishing ourselves as one of the ""good  actors"" that responded to the Clean Air Act to produce MTBE and has not  contributed to gasoline spills.   In terms of conversion to alkalytes, one of the complicating factors is the  ""tax"" angle.   In all the current legislative efforts in the House and  Senate, the sponsors are avoiding inclusion of tax provisions so that the  bills do not have to go through review by the separate tax committees, which  would delay the legislation probably to its demise.   Passing separate tax  legislation that contains alkalyte conversion provisions may also be  difficult -- in general, it will be hard for Congress to pass even modest tax  legislation this year.     If this emerges as a viable strategy, however, I think it is worth  consideration.   I will talk with Coastal to see what their strategy is and  follow up with you and Jim Prentice to see if it's appropriate to pursue.

They also advocate protection of litigation.  David believes that Congress cannot approve a multi-million dollar bailout of  MTBE producers but can pass a tax relief bill that would encourage MTBE  producers to convert their plants.

2022-04-10 18:38:19+00:00,true,6,"  As you all are aware, there is a heightened awareness throughout the company  of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing  a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success  at achieving those standards.  I have been asked by Sally to take the lead on  meeting this objective.  For the last several weeks, I have been involved in  an extensive review of the London office controls and procedures for their  gas and power trading businesses.  We have used the findings of this review  to start developing an assessment of controls, standards and measurement  methodology for the London office.  In order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards  across Enron, we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment  for the Houston gas and power businesses (we will assess global products and  other commodities traded at a later date).  I will be in Houston Tuesday and  Wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process.  I have scheduled a meeting next Weds., May 17 from 9:00 - 11:30 in EB49C1 so  that we may review our controls, define the standards of meeting those  control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not  operating properly.  Before that meeting, I would like for all of you to  develop for your  respective functional responsibilities the following:  - a listing of all controls your group is responsible for (i.e. cash  collections are timely)  - a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its  maximum effectiveness (i.e. cash is collected within 30 days of deal date  with            exceptions noted)  - a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard  (i.e. % of cash collected within 30 days)  - a description of current capabilities to calculate, track and report each  measurement (i.e. automated A/R aging report)  I would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control  functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads.  A lot of  work has already been done to identify this information so I would hope time  requirements for this will not be extensive.  I have attached a worksheet to  be completed with the information discussed above.  I have also attached a  high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but  it is certainly not all-inclusive and should be revised as necessary.  As discussed above, we will review the controls and standards listings for  each functional group in the Weds. meeting and also assess the risk  associated with each control.  I would like to achieve consensus on gas and  power operating standards for Houston by the end of the meeting.  Let me know  if you have any questions or comments regarding this process.  I look forward  to seeing you next week.

2022-04-10 14:34:05+00:00,true,6,"  Almost one month ago, Special Agent Carl Wake of the FBI called me about the  Steve Todoroff investigation.  He indicated that the FBI had recently learned  of the article about EOTT's NGL theft that appeared in the business section  of the Houston Chronicle.  Mr. Wake said it might be a matter the FBI would  like to investigate.  I told Mr. Wake that EOTT was currently working with  the Harris County District Attorney on the prosecution of this matter, and I  thanked him for the FBI's interest.  He told me that the FBI might want to  work with the Harris County District Attorney in investigating this matter,  and he stated that there may be investigative information that the FBI can  obtain more quickly than the Harris County District Attorney.  Mr. Wake  requested a copy of the materials we had provided to the Harris County  District Attorney.  In order to avoid damage to the good rapport we have established with  Assistant District Attorney Bill Moore, I asked John DeGeeter to call Bill  Moore and advise him of the contact that had been made by the FBI.  Bill  Moore agreed to call Carl Wake and work with Mr. Wake on his request for the  materials provided by EOTT.  Carl Wake called me again yesterday.  He has been working with Bill Moore.   Mr. Wake stated it was too early to speculate as to what charges would be  brought.  He did say that our materials clearly indicated federal wire fraud  and possibly mail fraud.  He said that where there is wire fraud, there is  usually money laundering.   The purpose of Mr. Wake's call yesterday was to inquire about the status of  some interview summaries that John DeGeeter and I have prepared and collected  at the request of Bill Moore.  Mr. Wake requested that EOTT send a copy of  the summaries to him when we sent the summaries to Bill Moore.  Those  summaries were sent out today.  I gathered from my calls with Carl Wake that the FBI is very interested in  taking an active part in this investigation.  In order to build on the  relationship we have established with Bill Moore, we will continue to direct  our inquires about the investigation to Mr. Moore until he tells us to do  otherwise.",I called Mr. Wake last month to talk about the Steve Todoroff investigation.

2022-04-10 22:29:47+00:00,true,6,"  In my response to Brent Price on the London Doorstep review I alluded to the  incompleteness of the list of issues. As I outlined, the key point has been  identified, but its knock - on effects are widespread and worrying,  especially as they concern the Continental Power operation:  As of today the most recent finalised DPR for this business was for 11th May,  and during the period between then and now we have seen (although in milder  form) a repeat of the turmoil on the Amsterdam Power Exchange (APX) that we  witnessed in January this year. This is not the time or the market to not  know our position.  The business is soon to apply for higher limits to accommodate a new  transaction on the Polish border. I am bound to comment that based on the  state it appears to be in, I would not recommend higher limits.  To add insult to injury, as a result of the way this area has been allowed to  develop, much of the know-how is in the heads (and spreadsheets) of certain  key individuals who it seems are now bound rapidly for EBS.   UK Gas seems to have slipped too. Yesterday they reported a $7m loss due to  the value of a set of options which were part of a structured deal, booked  ""off-system"" and not revalued for over a month. Worryingly, there seemed to  be more time spent arguing over the nuances of a Loss Notification memo, than  answering some fundamental questions about why it happened.  As a corollary, our process of performing ""risk reviews"" has become all the  more important in identifying holes in our capture and treatment of market  risk in the firm. I expect these to play a big part in our effort to  stabilise these areas.

Earlier  today I had lunch with Ken Capp and Mike from CNG Sabine and they brought up  the point that Enron is the only customer that is not using Sabine any  longer.  Most of their customers are using a combination of Sabine (IHT  Contracts) and CNG Transmission (TTT Contracts) for their daily business.     Ken is concerned about losing Enron as a customer since in the past we did a  lot of business through them.  Ken is now interested in doing some  negotiating.  As of today, CNG Transmission will not be charging any fees  until October at the earliest- if ever- for the service they are providing,  but after October, the fee could be up to 84 cents per transaction, applied  to the seller only.  Ken said that he would be willing to talk about lowering  his rates for Enron if that's what it would take to bring us back into their  customer list.  Of course, this is an exception to what they do for their  other customers, so Ken is requesting that we keep this negotiation process  confidential in the best interests of both parties.    If you have any other  questions about this conversation, please let me know.   Scott-  Ken's number is 713-752-4018, in case you don't have it.     Just as a side note:  Ken also mentioned that they are looking into providing  a hub service for Transco right now.

Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the sky. About 70 degrees. 11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself. 12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us). We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas. AWESOME MOMENT. 12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs. *Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants. 1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play  what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell  phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl.  And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:  $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in  triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my  subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I  RULE the pre-game kingdom. 2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy. 2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas. 3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas. Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy  from the Traveler. 3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.  I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone. Safety. 3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler. 4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom: ""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused. 4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch of pussies. 4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.  I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants. 5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field. 5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."" 5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter. As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the fucking PA system??!!"" 5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"", and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.  I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty. 6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October, they would be playing Florida State for the national championship. 6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.  I don't care. 7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig. 7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.  I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami. The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care. 8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.  I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon."" 8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.  I tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly. 8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to kick the shit out of Arizona. 9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a ""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me. 9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out  of a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light. 9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing. 10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off. 10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However, on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a bit seriously."" 10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look like I should be in an episode of Cops. 10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving. 10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and  no one is moving. I take a nap. 11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker."" 11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker."" 11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker."" 11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and  no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker."" 11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility, and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon."" 12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer.

He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length  mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's. 1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club.

And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We attempt to reason with him.

It was adjusted from Lowell,  Mass Nepco estimate and we changed format to more closely match  Homestead  form.  Biggest differences 'tween original Plano and original Homestead were:  Homestead had dual fuel     +4M Homestead had additional piling and foundation bulks  +1.8M Homestead was connecting to a complicated t-line config +1.5M Homestead had an FPL substation    +5M Homestead did not need as much gas pipeline    -2.1M Homestead used 6% margin     +4.4M Homestead had lower capacity due to additional chilling  +1.5% (not capital  cost but does change $/kW)  Differences from original Plano to new Plano is that Nepco has estimated a  union job for Lowell. This impacts indirects upward by about $5M and  construction up above my earlier guesstimate by about $4M. I had doubled the  cost per manhour which Nepco also did but additionally they added manhours  for productivity loss. Additionally I moved new Plano margin to 6%.  New Homestead went up due to raw water pretreatment and first stage RO but we  dropped the substation cost so total estimated cost went down by a coupla of  million.

2022-04-10 07:50:14+00:00,true,6,"  Ben  Roughly speaking if you use absorption chilling, you would save (at max  summer conditions) maybe 1.2 MW per LM or about 2.5% on capacity which would  be nominally a 2.5% improvement in heat rate. To get this you need a source  of steam. For Lowell, we possibly could get steam from UAE (I don't know how  the transaction would work). We would need about 180,000 lb/hr of steam at  least at 15 psig. The chillers would cost about $400,000 total more than the  mechanicals we have discussed.  If UAE can't supply the steam, then we would need small HRSG's behind each  CTG and would most likely also try and steam injection for NOx control. Heat  rate would improve by maybe 6-7%, plant net output would increase by maybe 2  MW per LM. Capital cost would grow by maybe $8,000,000 (this is wild guess,  we did get HRSG quotes for this steam injection/absorption version but have  not done a detailed capex).

SoCal filed a protest and I'm working on the response.  In  part, they are alleging that TW is ""attempting to exploit a weakness"" in the  GISB procedures to the detriment of existing customers.  For example, under  TW's tariff (which they concede is GISB compliant), primary firm cannot bump  alt. firm in cycle 2.  SoCal says this means that any primary shipper  attempting to deliever to an in-path alt. point will be unable to re-nominate  to its primary point once this ""alternate"" capacity [I assume they mean  USGT's] is confirmed.  According to SoCal this will substantially limit  shippers' flexibility, including the ability to use market area pooling.   Once gas is nominated thru a pool its subsequent movement to a delivery point  is defined as an al. delivery regardless of the rights of the capacity under  which it moves.  Thus by manipulating the GISB cycle process, TW and USGT  will bump firm shippers.  I could really use your help in responding to this argument.  (First of all,  I'm not sure I even understand it!)  If either of you have a few minutes  today or tomorrow when we could get together, that would be great.

2022-04-10 15:45:14+00:00,true,6,"  Thank you for keeping us in the loop on this.  D&B data will become one of  our most important sources.  As you suggest, the intent is to use this data  along with other available date to generate a price for credit.  The price  will be published externally (likely for a fee and as a free service) via the  web or via automated processes.    Option 3 appears to be the best solution for us given our desire for as up to  date data as possible.  Stuart is working with the credit team to define  additional data elements but the credit score and financial score are likely  what we are looking for.  Alternatively, if it is possible to obtain the  actual data that is used to generate the score that would allow us to  generate our own score in addition to D&B's.  We will need the Global Failure  Score as well.  Currently we are active in Europe as well as the US and  expect to move towards Asia and Austrailia over time.  Hopefully, this data  is available via D&B Connect.  Another consideration is the term of contract.  We would likely prefer a  longer term contract so that if they decide they don't like what we are doing  with the data, we cannot be cut off.  Does it make sense from your  perspective to approach D&B to be our long term, strategic providor of  customer data.  This would likely make their deal maker look good in his  boss's eyes, give you lot's of negotiating ability and give a us the long  term preferential contract that we are looking for.  Let's discuss further.  bryan      Mary Solmonson 05/05/2000 19:25 To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Philippe A Bibi/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stuart  Ffoulkes/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: Dun & Bradstreet Info for Credit Trading  I have received preliminary information from D&B.  I think several  issues/questions have been raised that if explored, could result in a better  solution for the money.    Option 1 The update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to  monthly for a cost of $87,000 (USD) through March, 2001.  Option 2 I wasn't sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in.  If  you are particularly interested in the Financial Stress Score and Credit  Score, for example, there are multiple alternatives :    2a) Keep quartlery refresh of base data (party name, etc) and refresh scores  that are added/changed on a monthly basis.  Cost - $1.17(USD) per  record.          Note that there are 575,000 records in the file currently  with financial and credit scores, making this potentially a very expensive  alternative          (575,000 X 1.17=$ 672,750).   2b) Batch or FTP updates of the financial and stress scores can only be  provided monthly.  D&B is working on a solution that would provide a  weekly         update to their customers in a batch or FTP manner, but has  not committed to when this will be ready.  Therefore, if more timely updates  than monthly                          are desired, it is also possible to  transactionally access records one at a time using D&B's software.  The cost  for this is extremely high at $10.52         (USD) per score.   Option 3 D&B Connect Product.  D&B Connect is a tool set of matching software, an externally validated  reference file, credit and marketing information, and D&B services that  enables the  most effective integration of customer information and  third-party information with D&B information.  Only this type of process and  information integration  capability can facilitate and ensure accurate  identification, linkage and maintenance of your customer's complete  relationship.   In addition, D&B Connect  assures organizations of  referential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to D&B so  that the most recent D&B information is always  transmitted to your  organization and updated within your local D&B Connect Reference File.  D&B  Connect is scalable.     Cost Typically ranging from  * Customer Access Module (CAM) Batch- - $25,000  * CAM Online - $50,000  * Full Information Integrator - $350,000 + data  With more specifics as to your needs, this option should perhaps be pursued.   Questions/Issues  1) D&B had questions regarding the use of their data and whether Enron  customers would be offered this information for a fee or free.  I explained  that I  did not feel the data would be offered directly to Enron customers,  but that it would be used to support analysis that would be available  externally via web  site, etc.  All pricing above is based upon this  understanding.  If I have not portrayed the usage correctly, it will be  imperative to get a better understanding  before final pricing can be  negotiated.  2)  Are there specific data elements that you are interested in ?   Alternatives may vary by data element.  Financial Stress Score and Credit  Score reference  above were explored as an example.  3)  What is timeframe for needing a solution ?  4)  Financial Stress Score and Credit Score are only available on U.S.  companies.  A comparable measure - Global Failure Score (the liklihood of  default or  bankruptcy)  is available for international companies.  This  rating score however, is NOT currently available via a batch or FTP manner.   This could result  in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this  score in a batch manner.  5)  Pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit  analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes.  This is  probably  negotiable as the data is the same.  The thought process is that if  the repository is used for credit or risk decisions, D&B will see decreased  usage and  revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments.
