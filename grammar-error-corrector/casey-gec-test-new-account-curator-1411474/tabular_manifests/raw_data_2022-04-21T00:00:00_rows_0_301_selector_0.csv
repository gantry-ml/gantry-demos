2022-04-21 04:18:46+00:00,true,1,"  Gentlemen, As most of you are aware, Enron's tax department has made recommendations in the past on how trading activities should be conducted to avoid duplicate taxation from Revenue Canada and the IRS.  In a nutshell, the recommendations were:  A trader that is a resident of the United States should not trade on behalf of Canadian entities such as Enron Canada Corp. and Enron Energy Services Canada Co. Ltd.; A trader that is a resident of Canada should not trade on behalf of US entities such as ENA or EES; In March 2001 when Dave Pope was an EES Canada employee, the recommendation was that Dave confirm all arrangements Houston based EES traders made on behalf of EES Canada.  The intent was that the Houston based trader would make the appropriate arrangements without committing EES Canada, then Dave would confirm the deal.  As Dave is no longer with EES, I will take on that role with Rob Milnthorp as my backup.  As stipulated in all Enron contracts, a trade completed on a recorded telephone line is considered a binding agreement, therefore, I suggest that when Jesus (or his proxy) makes a trade on behalf of EES Canada, he should state in the telephone conversation that the trade will be confirmed by EES Canada personnel.  Jesus, you can email me the details and I will confirm the trade - you should still fill out all paperwork.   In the future near future, EES Canada will be self sufficient and Canadian based traders will take on Jesus' role.    I have spoken to John McKay about western Canada and will speak with Marin Cuilla about eastern Canada to make sure we are all on the same page.  (Martin, could you reply to this email or call me at 403-974-6789 when you have a break from your trading?)     Mike and Ryan, please give me a shout if you have issues or concerns.  Thanks.  T.

Therefore, if you could just include  the Enron trades so that we have an accruate picture of the volume traded by  Enron that would fulfill our needs for the pie charts.  I understand your  concern regarding your position and do not necessarily need this information if  there is another way to get to the place we need to be with the pie  chart.

We had a little glitch last Friday when we tried to do our ""end-of-day"" poll at 5:00 and couldn't access the file.  We were able to get a copy of the file from Enron locally in Calgary and it solved our problem.  Alternatively, however, we would like to adapt the code so it doesn't try to poll late in the day (if the file won't be available late in the day).  Could you tell me if there are specific times when the file won't be available each day?  Thanks Jay.  Otherwise, the feed is working really well.

There are two reasons for the decline in sales volumes:   1.  Last year EOL offered a fixed rate product that produced minimal margins but a large volume of transactions.       It was decided that this product would not be offered in the year of 2001, but because there were winter deals       that continued through to March 2001, we did not see a decline in volumes until April 2001.             2.   Enron Canada was involved in ligitation with NGX, with respect to their publication of the Aeco index.  ECC did       not have any confidence in the index because the EOL deals were not included in determining the Aeco monthly index       and we felt the index could easily be manipulated.  As a result, ECC was hesistant to enter into Aeco Monthly index                   deals with counterparties thus reducing our volume of sales.  I hope this helps!  Cheryl","Susan.

2022-04-21 01:40:05+00:00,true,2,"    N E I L   A N D E R S O N   D A I L Y   D E V O T I O N A L              from Freedom in Christ Ministries  June 18  The Fleshly Person  I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are not yet able, for you are still fleshly. (1 Corinthians 3: 2,3).  The spirit of the fleshly person is identical to that of the spiritual person. The fleshly person is a Christian, spiritually alive in Christ and declared righteous by God. But that's where the similarity ends. Instead of being directed by the Spirit, this believer chooses to follow the impulses of his flesh. As a result, his mind is occupied by carnal thoughts and his emotions are plagued by negative feelings. And though he is free to choose to walk after the Spirit and produce the fruit of the Spirit, he continues to involve himself in sinful activity by willfully walking after the flesh.  His physical body is a temple of God, but he is using it as an instrument of unrighteousness. He has the same troubling physical symptoms experienced by the natural person because he is not operating in the manner God created him to operate. He is not presenting his body to God as a living sacrifice. Since he yields to the flesh instead of crucifying it, the fleshly man is also subject to feelings of inferiority, insecurity, inadequacy, guilt, worry, and doubt.  Several years ago I did some research to discover how many Christians are still the victims of their flesh. I asked the same question to 50 consecutive Christians who came to me to talk about problems in their lives: ""How many of the following characteristics describe your life: inferiority, insecurity, inadequacy, guilt, worry, and doubt:"" Every one of the 50 answered, ""All six."" Here were 50 born-again, righteous children of God who were so bogged down by the flesh that they struggled with the same problems of self-doubt which inundate unbelivers who only live in the flesh.  If I asked you the same question, how would you answer? I imagine that many of you would admit that some or all of these six traits describe you. It is evident to me that a staggering number of believers are still confused about their spiritual identity in Christ and its implications for their daily lives. We are struggling with the behavior aspect of our growth because we are still struggling with the belief aspect of our growth: who we are in Christ.  Father, help me live above my fleshly desires today by exercising my spiritual inheritance at every temptation.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

2022-04-21 22:05:56+00:00,true,2,"  Kevin, further to your voice-mail, as indicated to you yesterday, our physi= cal gas master agreement with ENA is in their form of Enfolio master agreem= ent and not our form of master.  What that means is that, although the mech= anics of declaring force majeure, etc. are the same, the definition of forc= e majeure under our Enfolio master with ENA is not restricted to delivery p= oint force majeure as it is in ECC's standard form, but is rather a broader=  based force majeure.  However, it must be kept in mind that, depending on = the transaction, the definition of ""force majeure"" may be amended in the te= rms of the particular confirmation letter.  The application section (which = is basically the same as in our form) is as follows:  This Article 5 is the sole and exclusive excuse of performance permitted un= der this Agreement, and all other excuses at law or in equity are waived to=  the extent permitted by law.  Except with regard to payment obligations, i= n the event either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Ma= jeure to carry out its obligations hereunder, it is agreed that upon such P= arty's giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure to the othe= r Party as soon as reasonably possible (such notice to be confirmed in writ= ing), the obligations of the Party giving such notice, to the extent that t= hey are affected by such event, shall be suspended from the inception and d= uring the continuance of the Force Majeure for a period of up to 60 Days in=  the aggregate during any 12 Month period, but for no longer period.  The P= arty receiving notice of Force Majeure may immediately take such action as = it deems necessary at its expense for the entire 60 Day period or any part = thereof.  The Parties expressly agree that upon the expiration of the 60 Da= y period Force Majeure shall no longer apply to the obligations hereunder a= nd both Buyer and Seller shall be obligated to perform...  I will send a copy of the agreement over to you which also contains the def= inition of Force Majeure, but again it must be remembered that such definit= ion may be amended in the particular confirm.

2022-04-21 12:19:21+00:00,true,2,"   A little summary of my travels so far!     After several e-mails back to myself, I believe I have figured out how to use this keyboard and the writing ?s hopefully readable {The poor grammar cannot be blamed on the keyboard though}.   On the plane over here, I met a turkish girl who used to be an english teacher, and hence spoke very good english.  I ended up staying at her place my first night in Turkey, she was going to give me a ride to my hotel but did not want to venture into the area in which the hotel was booked (don't trust everything you read on the internet!).  The plane got in very late, and I had not slept at all and was very tired.  A nice muslim priest decided to serenade me at 4:30 am from the mosque just down the hill, and my attempt at sleep ended.  Turns out muslims must pray five times a day, and the mosques blare out prayers to ensure that you don't forget.     We had breakfast on the bosphorus the following morning, where I was able to learn a little bit about the traffic laws in Turkey.  We were eating across the street from a police station on a one way road, yet that didn't stop anyone from driving the wrong way down the one way!  They drive like maniacs here, and are encouraged as far as I can tell.  The traffic lights in the towns actually have a countdown timer on them, and the light goes from red to yellow to green, just like at a racetrack!  Go figure!   I got on a bus to head south, and learned several things about Turkish culture and myself!  First, very few turkish speak english (I had kinda assumed that they all spoke english after taking to an english teacher on the plane), secondly, I cant speak Turkish!  After a while, I managed to write down where I wanted to go and found someone to point me in the proper direction.  The buses here are awesome, they give you coffee and tea, cookies and some lemon smelling stuff to put on your hands.  Partway through the trip some army guys got on the bus, and a guy with a big machine gun came and sat down beside me.  He stunk but I was not about to tell him so!!    I spent my first day touring the battlefields of Galipolli, with several Australians and New Zealanders.  The tourguide was awesome, and the site was really neat (although very few Canadians fought there).  I got back on a bus that evening and traveled to a town down south.  I met some New Yorkers on the bus, and they made me question my decision to go to school ?n the US.  One of the girls had no clue where Calgary was, until I explained to here that it was just north of Montana, it was the typical 'Speak American Please!'   On Saturday I toured the ancient ruins at Pergamum, which are located above the town of Bergama on top of a huge hill.  I decided after touring that I would walk back to town (about 5k),  wearing my big backpack ?n 35C heat!  After walking all the way down the hill, I got to the barbwire topped fence surrounding the ruins, I felt like an idiot but there was no way I was climbing back up the hill!  There were several young local guys running down the road, and I asked them for help.  There only suggestion was to jump the fence (explained by hand signals because they spoke little english),  and I figured it was worth a try!  I managed to get over the barbwire with my backpack and only cut up my knee a little bit.  They walked back to the village with me, and wanted me to pay for them to go to the other historical sites (I think?).  I took off faster than having being chased by an angry old man after snowballing cars, and hopped! on the next bus out of town.   Sunday I toured the ruins of Ephesus, which were really neat, and saw an old roman theater that Elton John had played in April.  Sunday I went up to the travertines at Pamukale, one of the seven wonders of the Ancient World.  The hillside is covered with calcium deposits, and there is water running down which collects in these pools where you were once allowed to swim (no longer because they were being destroyed).  Today I am sitting in a port town called Bodrum, and have just finished touring a ancient castle, and am heading to the mausoleum (another of the seven wonders!).  Following this, I am going to go to Marmaris and get on a sailboat tomorrow for a four day trip around many small islands in the Mediterranean Sea.   Hope all is well in Calgary, and will keep you all up to date through my journeys!

I'm pretty sure Jane Tholt, who trades El Paso on the West gas desk, will go.  Suzanne Calcagno has also indicated an interest so she may go as well.  Jane's major concern at this time is that El Paso doesn't mess with the pooling procedures.  Their proposal calls for increasing the number of pools on the system from the current six to twenty, which the Desk feels would impair liquidity.    I wouldn't look for a lot of progress at this conference.  The EOC full-requirements customers are going to be howling about having their flexibility restricted in any way, and the other firm customers who have CD limits are going to howl about the full requirements customers having a secondary priority superior to theirs.  This same proposal was on the table and they couldn't reach a compromise in six months of settlement conferences working with the chief FERC ADR person on the Amoco/Burlington complaint case.  Our preference is with the CD customers' position, but if the full requirements customers don't get some kind of accommodation, they will never settle.  Then if FERC rules against them, they will take it to the appeals court and maybe further.  This is a BIG issue for them.

How does the cap apply to index prices.  If the DJ-PV index settles at $120 and the cap is $98, do parties selling index have to adjust there price to $98?  2.  Would financial products (swaps) be affected by the cap?  3.  There has to be less ambiguity with respect to day ahead cash markets.  For example, assume it's a Monday and the ISO is under normal conditions and the price is $92.  Then assume on HE 14 the ISO declares a stage one and the price clears at $100 and the price is $100 for the rest of the day.  Tuesday assume the price is $85 during the first few offpeak hours, but the Wednesday forecast shows identical conditions as Monday.  What is the day ahead cash cap trading Tuesday for Wednesday? Is it $85 or $100?  One could make the argument that it should be $100 because it is reasonable to assume they will be in a stage one real time on Wednesday, but at the time cash is traded they are not in a stage one.  It seems to me the easiest way to solve this problem would be to have an independent market organization declare what the day ahead cash market price was before the cash market traded.  So for the example, they may recognize it's likely a stage 1 $100 cap will be in effect on Wednesday, so they'll set the cap at $100.  The market will know before hand and there will be no ambiguity.  More efficient market, less litigation.  4.  What about call options?  If a generator owns a call option at $125, the cap is $100, but the market is actually trading $150, does the generator have the right to exercise the option?  What if the generator has a plant that he can fire up at $150.  Does the generator have to wait until the price hits $150?  Seems like the strike price on an option would be an easily demonstrable expense.  And would there be a difference between a marketer owning an option and a generator owning an option?","Message-ID: 7243012.1075840064644.

2022-04-21 08:04:01+00:00,true,3,"  Wednesday morning, June 27 (before the CPUC decision to delay the vote on DA), I gave Marty Sunde this view on exit fees and surcharges for DWR costs in the California market:  There is a 75% probability that customers who go to direct access and who used utility service between January and June 2001 will pay an exit fee calculated as the difference between market price and utility rates during that period.  The exit fee could also include the going forward costs or alternatively, those costs could be passed along in the form of a uniform surcharge.  In other words, with regard to past costs, regulators or legislators would require DA customers to pay the amount they belive had been sucked from the state during the January-June crisis period.  I said the ""retroactive ratemaking"" argument is a nicety that California could easily dispense with.  Now that we know the CPUC decision will be delayed, I think the probability of exit fees for retroactive costs is even higher - either the DA legislation will pass between now and July 3, or Carl Wood will change the PUC order to get the ""jailbreaking"" customers to pay up.

Below is a C= liff Notes version of the Judge's report and recommendation issued at 4:49 = PM today.  Attached is the complete work. =20  The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due- ""While the amount of=  such refunds is not $8.9 billion as claimed by the State of California, th= ey do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billi= on dollars in an aggregate sum.  ?At the same time, while there are vast su= ms due for overcharges, there are even larger amounts owed to energy seller= s by the CAISO, the investor owned utilities, and the State of California. =  Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller= ?  The Chief Judge thinks not.""  Another notable quote:  ""?it is the opinio= n of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has=  not and cannot be substantiated."" =20  The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July 5, which wa= s summarily rejected by the State of California, and that the five separate=  offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also = rejected.=20  =20 Refund Effective Date- Refund effective date of October 2, 2000, for sales = in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX.  The Chief Judge's recomme= ndations do not go beyond that date.  ""Spot market"" sales are ""sales that a= re 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to de= livery.""=20  Evidentiary Hearing- ""The differences between what the State of California = believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what = the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise mater= ial issues of fact. The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds = involve factual disputes.  Thus, the Chief Judge recommends that a trial-ty= pe, evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to = the methodology set forth below.  Because of the urgent need for an answer = to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60-day fast track schedule= .  It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating pot= ential refunds in this proceeding.  However, such a methodology may not be = appropriate for all sellers in the CAISO's and Cal PX's spot markets in an = after-the-fact refund calculation.    In any event, sellers not using the m= ethodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceede= d the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund = period.""  Methodology- The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t= he June 19th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order = to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAIS= O's and Cal PX's spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period O= ctober 2, 2000 through May 28, 2001. =20  Heat Rate- The actual heat rates, rather than hypothetical heat rates (asso= ciated with recreating the must-bid requirement of the June 19th Order) pro= vide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit.  Gas Cost-  The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based = upon a daily spot gas price.  ""In the event that the marginal unit is locat= ed in NP15 (North of Path 15), the daily spot gas price for PG&E Citygate a= nd Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the = marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  If = the marginal unit is located in SP15 (South of Path 15), the daily spot gas=  price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by t= he marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  = The daily spot gas prices should be for the ""midpoint"" as published in Fina= ncial Times Energy's ""Gas Daily"" publication for the aforementioned deliver= y points.  The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the = refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published (weekends and hol= idays).""=20  O&M Adder-  An adder of $6/MWh for O&M should also be included with the cal= culated market clearing price. =20  Emissions Costs- Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the ma= rket clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may s= ubtract from their respective refund calculation.  Credit Adder- The 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearin= g price for all transactions that occurred after January 5, 2001 when PG&E = and SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy.  Ancillary Services-  Consistent with the June 19th Order, ancillary service=  prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the rea= l-time imbalance energy market.  Adjustment bids would also be treated the = same as set forth in the June 19th Order.=20  Maximum Price for Non-Emergency Hours- Somewhat unclear.  The Chief Judge r= ecommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculat= ing refunds, the refund methodology should deviate from the 85% non-emergen= cy requirement of the June 19th Order.  To measure the amount that actual p= rices may have exceeded the refund price, every hour should be recalculated= .  Offsets-  ""Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a ref= und calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all char= ges for the refund period.  Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts=  due from buyers would be recalculated.  Any refunds could then be offset a= gainst accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their=  purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period.""  Interest-  Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless=  the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller.

gregory_kramer@ams.com X-cc:  X-bcc:  X-Folder: \ExMerge - Crandall, Sean\Inbox\RTO X-Origin: CRANDELL-S X-FileName:   ""Hello, Everyone -  The purpose of this memo is to keep you all up-to-date on the overall development program and schedule for RTO West and to follow-up on the Regional Representatives Group meeting on June 27.  We have heard from many stakeholders about the need to use our time wisely over the next few months so we can focus on preparing a comprehensive filing with FERC on December 1.  Specifically, we have heard that too much time spent on drafting and commenting on an interim filing by August 31 would drain everyone's resources and deflect attention from the substantive work on congestion management, pricing, planning and expansion, interreregional coordination and seams resolution, and the other subjects that will be addressed in the December 1 filing. As you'll recall,  FERC also set a December 1 deadline for a status report on seams resolutions, participation by Canadian entities, a framework for formation of a West-wide RTO, and a timetable for achieving that end.  We have also heard from members of the Northwest Congressional delegation that it is important to proceed in a measured way with RTO West development and to ensure that public entities and regional leaders are given the opportunity to review and analyze the elements of the  RTO West filing proposal.  In response to these suggestions, the RTO West filing utilities have agreed to focus on the December 1 comprehensive filing and to prepare, at most, a brief and limited interim filing. The content and timing of the interim filing is still being discussed.  We will develop and circulate a revised development schedule for meetings and content group activities focused on the December 1 filing as soon as we can.  In its April 26 Order, FERC stated ""In light of Canada's involvement in the Western marketplace, the Commission supports the efforts to accommodate Canadian participation in RTO West.""  To that end, the filing utilities are pleased that British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority has joined with them as a filing utility effective July 10, 2001. In addition, RTO West and Alberta representatives met recently to discuss avenues for closer coordination between them over the next few months.  Regarding interregional coordination and seams work, RTO West representatives continue to work with Desert STAR and California ISO representatives to define interregional issues and develop solutions on a more organized basis.  The filing utilities are fully aware of the renewed emphasis from FERC on achieving a single, coordinated and transparent bulk power market in each region and the importance FERC attaches to removing obstacles between the western RTO groups.  The filing utilities intend to diligently pursue this interregional coordination work over the next few months so that the December 1 filing will report substantial progress in seams resolution and achievement of a seamless western power market. FERC's order issued on July 12 in Docket Number RTO1-35 specifically supports the filing utilities' current voluntary efforts.  Finally, the first meeting of the RTO West benefit-cost work group occurred on Tuesday, July 10.  Discussion centered on the scope, elements, and level of detail of the proposed study.  Over the next several weeks, a draft Informal Competititve Solicitation will be prepared, reviewed, and revised by the work group.  It will then be sent to a list of potential consultants when it is ready and posted on the RTO West website.  Because certain elements of the filing, particularly pricing and congestion management, are important to preparation of the benefit-cost study, there will need to be careful sequencing of the study with the substantive work on these filing elements.  We would like to thank all of you who commit so much time and energy to the development of RTO West.  We are well aware of the demands on your time, and we appreciate the efforts you are all making.  As soon as our schedule is firmed up, we will send out the date for the next RRG meeting.  - Bud""  ","Message-ID: 27324099.1075840060594.JavaMail.evans@thyme> Date: Thu, 12 Jul 2001 21:07:17 -0700 (PDT) From: ekrogh@serv.net Subject: RTO"

I will be on the cal= l on Monday and plan to participate on Wednesday via conference call.   I c= an be available to be in New York if necessary.=20  Ken Raisler, with Sullivan and Cromwell in New York, brought this to my att= ention in late June.   Ken and I worked on the swap language as part of the=  Commodities Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) last year and Linda Robertson=  and Larry Decker worked on the issue from the Department of Treasury. We have worked closely with Mark Taylor and his colleagues in legal on thes= es issues.  I sat in on a call with the commercial team last week to see what sort of r= etail swap products we would offer, if we decide to offer any.  Attached ar= e their preliminary product offerings which are being reworked.    =20  At the time the CFMA passage, Enron did not anticipate entering the retail = swap market.  The issue of retail swaps was quite controversial and was one=  of the primary issues that delayed passage of the CFMA.  Because of the co= ntroversy, the final language in the Act requires the Commodity Futures Tra= ding Commission (CFTC), the Board of the Governors fo the Federal Reserve, = (the Fed), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Secretary = of Treasury to study the issues associated with the offer and sale of retai= l swap products and report no later than a year after passage ( by the end = of 2001).  The request to interview Enron came from the CFTC.  On August 2,=  2001 the CFTC, Fed, SEC, and Treasury (the FDIC and the Office of the Comp= troller of the Currency will also participate) will interview 7 or 8 partie= s at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.   I know that ISDA and AIG have = been requested to interview, and assume Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JP M= organ are among the others.   We have agreed to the interview and understan= d  the responses will be confidential.    I  will fax you the request lette= r so you can see the questions that they want addressed.  CONCERNS:  1)  Likely the other entities that are being interviewed are regulated...we=  must not say anything which would indicate that our current business needs=  further regulation. 2)  We had a significant victory in the much lauded Swap exemption, which p= rovides an exemption from the CEA for energy and metal swaps, except in cas= es of fraud and manipulation.  I do NOT want to have to reopen the CEA with=  amendments, because the current political environment could lead to a loss=  of or meddling in the current exemption. 3)  I am concerned that any indication of offering retail swaps on EnronOnl= ine, could lead to a greater interest in regulation of EnronOnline. 4)  Retail swaps will be regulated, likely by the CFTC.  Are we prepared to=  enter a regulated business?  Is there regulatory creep into our existing b= usiness?  Do we have other regulators take greater interest in Enron activi= ties?  It may be too late for this last question.  Look forward to talking more about this. =20     =09James D Steffes/ENRON@enronXgate 07/20/2001 09:26 AM =09   To: Chris Lon= g/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Lisa Yoho/NA/Enron@Enron  cc: Linda Robertson/NA/Enron@= ENRON, Richard Shapiro/ENRON@enronXgate, Vicki Sharp/HOU/EES@EES  Subject: = CFTC Request for Information on Retail Swaps for Enron Direct Customers=09   Chris & Lisa --  EES has been requested by the CFTC to present at a closed-door session on t= he matter of retail swaps for energy products to small customers (dry clean= ers, etc.).

2022-04-21 06:17:34+00:00,false,3,"  Jim,   Sorry to be late.  I could only come up with a top seven.  Strategy for FERC Advocacy.  What are the potential risks of a Standard Model versus the delay in waiting for slowly developing Regional Proposals? Congestion Management.  Depends on outcome of above discussion.  Do we continue to work on proposals not conforming to the Standard Model? Definition of Long Term Transmission Property Right, (be that financial or physical).  This is the key to expansion; any party building or funding new transmission needs to have certainty regarding what they acquire for their investment.  Do we order transmission owners to build for revenue requirement and then just auction off rights once built?  This is really the old monopoly model.  Is it possible/preferable to use an open-season model for major expansion products between market hubs? Allocation/Auction of FTRs.  The existing systems are heavily committed so little will be left to auction under most allocation schemes.  Often the existing claims have to be prorated.  The Grid Florida order seems to validate allocation proposals.  What is our position? Secondary Markets for Transmission Rights.  The lack of secondary liquidity in PJM-FTR  and NY-TCCs goes much deeper than just the allocation of the rights.  What changes are needed to move the market?  Would a change in information availability (price and physics) change the market?  Does the definition right need to be modified?   RTO Governance Model.  The paramount need is independence from energy market, which goes beyond the nature of the board to the depth of involvement in the market.  There is always some one pushing things like long run acquisition of ancillary services, which then gives the RTO a position in the energy market and its role as operator is biased to protect is position.  The California experience is instructive as the ISO has begun to see its duty of controlling prices instead of a duty to impartially operate the system. Transition to RTO-World.  NERC activities seem to continue to be focused on the ATC/TLR approach while the RTOs are moving to congestion management systems in which ATC something of a anachronism.  Is this the time for NERC to be writing a entire new set of standards to meet the needs of a passing paradigm.

2022-04-21 03:56:12+00:00,true,3,"  Miguel,  To further clarify the CNG settlement provision with regard to Base Gas sales please see the following.  ""CNG will credit to its customers through the TCRA any net proceeds from such sales above net book value up to a cumulative level of the costs that CNG has recovered from its customers through the stranded cost surcharge under Section 18.2.A of the General Terms and Conditions of its Tariff.  In addition, CNG will credit to its rate base one half of any cumulative net proceeds from such sales that are in excess of the cumulative amount collected under Section 18.2.A, and CNG will retain the other half.""  Section 18.2.A of CNG's tariff provides for the recovery of Stranded Costs (as a result of Order 636 or its progeny).  Examples of stranded costs that are potentially eligible for recovery under this section are storage facilities, production facilities, product extraction facilities and transmission facilities that have been rendered no longer used or useful as a result of the pipeline's compliance with Order 636.  Basically, the level of gains to be retained by CNG is dependent upon the level of stranded costs (facility costs -  e.g. losses on sale of gathering facilities) incurred by CNG and collected from its customers.  It is simply a netting mechanism (losses and gains) to address customer concerns that the pipeline could potentially recover its losses on the sale of assets as stranded costs, and also retain the gains on the sale of assets, including base gas.  The TCRA (Transition Cost Rate Adjustment) account is a convenient surcharge mechanism used by the pipeline to, among other things, flow-through such gains covered by the stipulation and applicable tariff provisions.   Requiring clarification with CNG, the following is how I think this mechanism would work.  If CNG incurred and collected cumulative stranded costs of $100 and experienced a gain of $50 on the sale of base gas, CNG would credit the entire $50 to its customers through the TCRA.    If the gain were $150 on the sale of base gas, CNG would credit $100 to the TCRA, credit its Rate Base with $25 and retain $25.    In the best case scenario (i.e. past cumulative gains are equal are greater than cumulative stranded costs) CNG would be able to keep all the cash from the future sales of base gas, but would be required to credit rate base in the amount of 50% of the gain and recognize the other 50% as extraordinary income.  While there are probably some reports CNG has filed detailing the cumulative level of stranded costs recovered under 18.2.A and the gains realized on the sale of assets offsetting such stranded costs, this would be something the regulatory folks at CNG could verify.  Hope this helps.  If you further questions please let me know.","Miguel, To further clarify the CNG settlement provision with regard to Base Gas sales please see the following.

What about the generators?  Have then been involved, since presumably, their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the bill)? What about large customers?  They been screaming for more infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not delivering it. Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or opposing the bill?  I'll try to check around, too, in between the electric mayhem. There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the interstates from building into the state. If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e., interstates) bringing pipe into the state?  Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis. In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron. The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg). When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers). In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.   The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03. The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious). Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts. The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost. Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access. Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any ""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.) In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts. All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.  We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

2022-04-21 07:38:46+00:00,true,3,"  Ursala:  The CPUC set up many road blocks to forward contracting.  The history is complicated.  The following note came from a chronology published by CA legislature Republicans.  I think the bullets could say:  ? Load serving utilities were given extremely limited authority to enter into PX administered block forward contracts before spring of 2000. ?  ? With the run up in spot prices, all three utilities request and receivedthe ability to enter into forward contracts during Summer 2000.  However, preapproval or clear review guidelines were not forthcoming by the CPUC. Utilities, faced with second guessing and claims that forward prices were ""too high,"" did not enter into contracts. ?  ? By Fall 2000, the utilities still had not forward contracted in any substantial way.  Despite numerous requests made to the CPUC, it had taken no meaningful actions to improve the certainty of recovery of prudent foward contracts entered into by utilities.  To this day, contracting guidelines do not exist.      Excerpt/Source: October 16, 2000 PG&E files documents with the FERC showing huge cash flow shortfalls. PG&E writes Loretta Lynch that after 9 weeks, the CPUC staff has not produced guidelines for long-term contracts and still has not done so today. SCE later concurred that they were hitting roadblocks with the CPUC staff while trying to get approval of long-term contracts. Edison asks a total of seven times in 20 months for broader authority to make the kind of electricity buys the governor now says will deliver us from the crisis. Each time, the CPUC either denies Edison's request or approves it only after applying significant restrictions that ultimately make it impractical for the utility.

2022-04-21 03:20:38+00:00,true,3,"  The FERC order appears to be putting a significant crimp on the  real time (R/T) desk of Enron and other marketers whenever market prices are at or near the cap.  The initial west wide cap is approx $108 an we hit that today in R/T. Briefly:  Marketers cannot sell above the cap.  So when prices reach the cap, generators are on their own to find buyers. (Generators can sell above the cap; if the generator is thermal they simply make a end-of-month cost filing.)  Marketers which provide an important function of making the market and providing transmission are simply shut out.  Even if a marketer makes a deal below the cap, the deal could be cut due to transmission problems.  Should the cost of replacement power exceed the cap (which can easily happen), the marketer may be left holding the bag because, again, the marketer cannot sell above the cap.   When CAISO declares an emergency, the cap will change hourly.  R/T deals are usually done several hours out.   A marketer will essentially have no idea what the relevant cap will be when it is making its deal.  Cash markets can also face all these same problems.  However, the cash desks may be able to sell more than 24 hours out.   Because these impacts are disproportionate on marketers, we should consider an appeal of this order separate from EPSA.

Docket No. ER01-2103-000   ORDER REJECTING TARIFF AMENDMENTS WITHOUT           PREJUDICE                             (Issued July 20, 2001)            In this order we reject, without prejudice, proposed      amendments of Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI) and Portland      General Electric (PGE) to their respective market-based rate      tariffs that would allow them to make inter-affiliate sales using      the EnronOnline trading platform.       I.   Background            On May 22, 2001, in separate filings, affiliates PGE in      Docket No. ER01-2097-000 and EPMI in Docket No. ER01-2103-000      (collectively Applicants) filed to amend their respective market-      based rate schedules to allow for inter-affiliate sales through      the EnronOnline trading platform, and to prohibit communication      among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on      EnronOnline or the times that PGE will be making trades on                  1      EnronOnline.   This amendment does not supplant the existing      provisions of PGE's and EPMI's currently effective tariffs which      allow for inter-affiliate sales subject to conditions that the      Commission generally imposes on inter-affiliate sales where there      are captive customers, e.g., allowing a public utility to sell to      its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower      than the rate it charges non-affiliates, requiring simultaneous      offers to non-affiliates, or requiring use of a relevant,      established index.  Rather, PGE and EPMI propose to amend their      respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make                 1                 The EnronOnline system is administered by Enron Networks,           an Enron Corp. subsidiary.  EnronOnline is a free, Internet-           based, transaction system which allows EPMI's customers to view           real time prices from EPMI's traders and transact instantly           online.  EnronOnline is not an EPMI application, but rather           EnronOnline is a trading platform used as a tool by EPMI in           buying from and selling power to third parties.                  Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -2-           and ER01-2103-000       inter-affiliate sales via EnronOnline, with restrictions      different than those in place but that, they state, will still      prevent affiliate abuse.  Applicants state that the Commission's      requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in      electronic commerce and, in particular, the Commission's      requirement that ""PGE post on its website notice of a potential      purchase or sale with EPMI prior to PGE entering into the      transaction with EPMI prohibits PGE from using EnronOnline, since      EnronOnline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not      provide for a waiting period before consummating the                   2      transaction.""   According to Applicants, this deprives PGE of the      ability to buy or sell power ""from perhaps the largest marketer                                                                 3      in its region, to the detriment of PGE and its ratepayers.""       II.  Notice of Filing and Interventions/Protests            Notices of the filings were published in the Federal      Register, 66 Fed. Reg. 29,939 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2097-000),      and 66 Fed. Reg. 30,180 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2103-000), with      motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before      June 12, 2001.  None was filed.       III. Discussion            The Commission allows power marketers and their public      utility affiliates to sell to one another at market-based rates      when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate      abuse.  As the Commission has explained, affiliate abuse can      occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers      sells power at below-market prices to, or purchases power at      above-market prices from, an affiliate without captive customers      (such as a power marketer affiliate).  One way in which the      Commission has sought to prevent this type of cross-subsidization      by captive customers is to require the pricing of inter-affiliate                                                              4      sales at an established, relevant market price or index.      Another way, when there is no assurance that the affiliates are      transacting at the prevailing market price, is to adopt various      conditions previously established by the Commission to prevent                      5      affiliate abuse.                 2                 EPMI Application at 3; PGE Application at 4.                3                 EPMI Application at 3; PGE Application at 4.                4                 See, e.g., DPL Energy, Inc. 90 FERC   61,200 (2000);           accord, First Energy Trading Services, Inc., 88 FERC   61,067 at           61,156 (1999).                5                 E.g., GPU Advanced Resources, Inc., 81 FERC   61,335 at                                                         (continued...)

PGE, when buying from EPMI      using EnronOnline, will be required to ""take the transaction      price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular                                                               6      location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment.""

Applicants also propose to amend their      respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication      regarding prices posted on EnronOnline.            Applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate      abuse occurs since PGE will only be able to transact with EPMI at            5            (...continued)           62,539 (1997) (GPU); Detroit Edison Company, 80 FERC   61,348 at           62,197-98 (1997) (Detroit Edison).  In GPU, the Commission           allowed sales from a power marketer to its affiliated traditional           public utility at a rate that was no higher than the lowest rate           the public utility paid non-affiliates under certain standard           supplier agreements.

Detroit Edison provided that a traditional           public utility may sell power to its affiliated power marketer           only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non-           affiliates; that the utility simultaneously offer through its           electronic bulletin board to sell to non-affiliates at the same           rate offered to its affiliate; and that all prices charged to the           affiliate be simultaneously posted on its electronic bulletin           board.  Accord, Jersey Central Power & Light Co., 82 FERC           61,023 at 61,071 (1998); Commonwealth Edison Co., 85 FERC           61,288 at 62,176-77 (1998).                6                 EPMI Application at 4; PGE Application at 5.                7                 In the case of a Limit Order on EnronOnline, EPMI would           know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or           lower than that currently available.  Applications at 3.  While           Applicants do not define ""Limit Order,"" the common understanding           is that, unlike a market order, which instructs a broker to           transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in           the marketplace, a limit order instructs a broker to fill the           order only if certain conditions are met.  Generally, a limit           order may be either a day order, in which case it expires when           the market closes if unfilled, or good-until-canceled, in which           case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled.                  Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -4-           and ER01-2103-000       the posted price (a price that is offered to all market      participants) and there will be no transactions in which EPMI      knows that PGE is the counter-party before the transaction is      finalized.  Thus, Applicants contend that not only will PGE be      unable to negotiate special terms with EPMI through EnronOnline,      but EPMI will have no discretion to take actions which favor PGE.      Applicants further offer that procedures are performed by      computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of      PGE.  In addition, because the EnronOnline price is posted      electronically and is available to all market participants,      Applicants state that PGE's customers have the opportunity to      transact with EPMI on EnronOnline on the same terms and      conditions that are available to PGE.            Applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed      restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the      Commission's affiliate abuse requirements and conditions (e.g.,      protection against PGE buying too high or selling too low in its                                            8      transactions with its affiliate EPMI).   The thrust of      Applicants' argument is that the Commission's affiliate abuse      concerns are satisfied by using EnronOnline, a public medium, for      selling power between affiliates.  We disagree.  While perhaps      faster and easier to use than phone calls, faxes, or letters, an      Internet-based platform is just another medium for trade, and      speed and ease of use do not dictate that the Commission's      affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied.  There is, for      example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline                                         9      represent prevailing market prices.            Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI      via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no      affiliate abuse.  We are not certain, however, that the posted      price necessarily represents the market price.  While, on the      surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an      auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result      of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,      for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to      sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI                           10      is willing to buy at.    For other transactions through media      other than EnronOnline, including other exchanges, EPMI might be                 8                 See supra notes 4-5 and accompanying text (citing cases           that discuss Commission's underlying concerns with affiliate           power sales).                9                 See supra note 4 and accompanying text.                10                  All transaction on EnronOnline involve EPMI as a           participant.  For sales, EPMI is the seller.  For purchases, EPMI           is the buyer.                  Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -5-           and ER01-2103-000                                                               11      willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices.      Moreover, Applicants provide no information about how product      prices posted by EPMI are determined, or whether there would be      any restrictions on what products PGE could trade via      EnronOnline, or even whether there are other similar, but non-      affiliated, Internet-based venues where PGE can electronically      trade those products to attain similar benefits.            Having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be      transacting at a prevailing market price via EnronOnline, we now      turn to whether the Applicants have met other conditions      established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse.      Regarding transactions in which EPMI may be purchasing from PGE      through EnronOnline, there is nothing in the Applicants' proposed      restrictions that would require PGE to      simultaneously offer to sell to non-affiliates at the same rate      offered to the affiliate.  The Commission requires that, with      respect to any power offered to its affiliate, PGE make the same      offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its      electronic bulletin board.  But it is unclear whether PGE can or      will make the same offer to non-affiliates.            Applicants also offer as a protection that PGE is prohibited      from submitting Limit Orders, which would prevent EPMI from      knowing that PGE is the counter-party to a transaction.  Again,      this would not prevent EPMI from selling power to PGE at above-      market prices.            The Commission is not assured by the Applicants' proposal      that transactions between PGE and EPMI conducted via EnronOnline      will occur in a manner that is consistent with the Commission's      expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for      inter-affiliate power sales transactions.  There is, for example,      no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how      unaffiliated customers, or other interested parties, would      monitor inter-affiliate transactions.            For the above reasons, we will reject the proposed      amendments, without prejudice to Applicants revising their      proposal to address the Commission's concerns and incorporating      appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse.                       11                  Likewise, PGE might be willing to buy at lower prices and           sell at higher prices.

2022-04-21 21:36:07+00:00,true,3,"  The wierdness continues.....  In the Senate: After Burton's ""proclamation"" yesterday afternoon that Senate bill 78XX was ""all Edison was getting, period,"" the bill was voted down in committee and never made it to the full Senate for a vote. The bill will be ""reconsidered"" (i.e., voted on again) today in the same committee.    In the Assembly: Hertzberg's bill (82XX) got voted down initially, until Rod Wright switched his vote and let it get out. 82 XX then went to the appropriations committee, where it was voted out, and now it's scheduled for a floor vote this morning. 83XX, the bipartisan bill led by Wright (D) and Richman (R), was also voted out of committee and will go to appropriations today.  Will report back later this AM with any additional information.

In the Senate: The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee. Burton announced during one of the two ""informational"" hearings that ""this is it,"" despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt. The key features of the bill are: Banks and QFs get paid in full. Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers No direct access. There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it.  In the Assembly: The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with Hertzberg's the likely winner. That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today). We're attempting to get the ""July 12"" date changed to ""the effective date of the bill"" or later. The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest.  The Problem: The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the night. The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.  The likely outcome given the circumstances:   Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a ""fair"" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.  That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.  In short, little has changed since yesterday.  Best, Jeff","The wierdness continues.....

2022-04-21 04:27:29+00:00,true,3,"  I spoke with Chuck Shoneman and Randy Rich (another partner at Bracewell also working on the case) yesterday regarding their estimate of time and cost to prepare a memo responding to the questions in the presentation.  Upon further reflection, Chuck thinks that, in order for the law firm to provide a useful and informative document, the memo must be pipeline specific.  He thinks that he can prepare the memo within the time frame discussed (aiming for end of July 4 week but no later than mid-July), for about $30,000 (plus costs, estimated to be about $5,000).  However, in order to meet this time frame, they will need some upfront information.  Specifically:  1. Based on the three pipelines we discussed, they would like to get the FERC case docket numbers where FERC  issued certificates for the particular storage facilities being considered.  Because these pipelines have many  storage fields, it will save a lot of time and money to have these docket numbers up front.   The pipelines should  have this information available.  If we cannot narrow down the facilities that we're looking at, the law firm's   response memo will not be as useful and they may not be able to meet our timing requests.  2. Additionally, the law firm would like to have all of the settlements and side agreements that the pipelines have entered into with its customers regarding the storage facilities at issue.  The law firm's analysis will be impacted  by these agreements, and obtaining the settlements from public records would be time consuming and costly,  and side agreements are not publicly filed.  In order to access this information, it will be most efficient if our regulatory people meet with the pipelines' regulatory people to obtain the exact information that we need for the analysis.  Please let us know if this is doable.  One last point, Chuck asked if we would know by Monday whether we want to engage the firm for the work.  I told him we won't know before Wednesday, and he said that is fine, but the longer we wait to engage the firm, the further we push the date out for when the firm will get us a final product.  Just something to keep in mind.  Also, Donna's computer is broken and she cannot send emails, so she asked me to send this message about her follow up discussion with Henry May:  Henry May estimates that his firm can do the work for approximately $30,000.  However, he is making no promises about the result, and Donna got the impression that, even after we spend $30,000 for his analysis, his end result may be that we cannot do the deal.  Henry did mention, however, that a partner of his worked on a financing deal for Enron regarding Bamel Storage.  Robert Neustadter is looking into that transaction further.  Thanks  Sarah","Additionally, I spoke with Chuck Shoneman and Randy Rich (another partner at Bracewell also working on the case) yesterday regarding their estimates of time and cost to prepare a memo responding to the questions in the presentation.

2022-04-21 05:45:57+00:00,true,3,"  Lynn, I have resolved Tony Gee and Matt Martindale questions concerning this weekend storage allocation for the gas day June 23.  Matt was concern that Tenaska's Mid-17 contract 106171 was cut by our storage allocation the first time on Intraday 2.  In fact this contract received a small cut on the Non-Grid AM cycle.  Matt changed his nomination in the evening cycle to change some of his supply from Northern Border's Ventura to Mid-17 storage.  This nomination change will now be code as ""incremental"" on his storage contract 21229 for the remaining cycles.  Tenaska was able to avoid storage allocation cut on their IDD contract 21229 until Intraday 2 due to a ""PRR"" code for supply cut by Northern Border at Ventura.  Our storage allocation  only cut Tenaska Mid-17 path for gas delivered to their contract 21344 due to storage cuts downstream.  I have advised Matt  to be aware of these problems when changes nomination.  Tony Gee thought he was being ""bump"" or cut in the Intraday 2 cycle on his IT contract 5915 and FDD  contract 102835 on his supply from Northern Border's Ventura.  Prior to Intraday 2 we donot true-up storage allocation cuts until Intraday 2 with Northern Border.  Tony was only checking his nomination with Northern Border on his contract 5915 and seeing all his volume schedule to flow.  Tony failed to check his schedule volumes in Hot-Tap after the evening cycle to see his actual schedule volume was cut due to storage allocation.

2022-04-21 03:49:21+00:00,true,3,"  Jim,  As per our meeting on Jun 15 below is a list of my top 10 (6) RTO issues:  Independent Board with stakeholder (advisory) board(s).  Once an RTO become= s fully funded and operational it is essential that there is an independent=  group of individuals responsible for making business decisions.  However b= eneath this organization should be specific stakeholder groups which work o= ut details of issues to be decided upon by the Board.  The advisory groups = should included at least a planning, market operations and monitoring commi= ttees. Balancing Energy / Ancillary Service Market(s).  (Defining market as a plac= e for participants to conduct trading business - not commit resources as in=  PJM, ISO-NE or NY and a place for the RTO to ""post"" requirements for ancil= lary services, etc.)  The market does not have to be run directly by the RT= O but I believe, for the sake of liquidity, you need one centrally utilized=  (endorsed) market available for participants to access. This would NOT pre= clude any other markets from operating in parallel.  Based upon the CA expe= rience, where, once the CalPX folded, there was not a significant increase = in activity on APX.  Our real time traders need a market with sufficient de= pth to be able to liquidate outstanding positions in the physical market.  = Without a single balancing energy/ancillary service market operated or sanc= tioned by the RTO these markets would become disbursed and we would suffer = until the market itself sorted out which one it preferred to use. Congestion Management - The rights can either be physical or financial.  Th= ere are two key elements, there needs to be some type of flow-based methodo= logy for assignment and scheduling, and there must be a form of ""use-it or = lose-it"" stipulation.  First, the mapping of the rights to the actual use o= f the system eliminates ahead of time most of the curtailments currently be= ing experienced in the eastern interconnection.  A flow-based reservation a= nd scheduling scheme, with proper information sent to the market, allows pa= rticipants to be pro-active in resolving any potential congestion either by=  re-scheduling, offering counter-flows or simly accepting re-dispatch costs= .  Second with no use it or lose it rule there will not be a robust seconda= ry market of unused transmission rights. All one has to do is look at the l= ack of liquidity and trading of FTR's in PJM and CA and TCCs in NY to see t= here is NO incenmtive for the holders of those rights to dispose of unused = rights or sell them to an entitiy who would find value in acquiring them.  = A secondary market for transmission rights is essential for several reasons=  not the least of which is initial distribution of rights to incumbents and=  grandfathered contracts.  If these two procedures limit the amount of avai= lable transmission on a firm basis to the market, at least with a well desi= gned secondary market this should make transmission capability available, a= t least on a short-term basis.  In addition it is key that the RTO process = schedules in a timely manner and post to the marketplace unused transmissio= n capability which would be available on some type of recallable basis. Interconnection Agreement - If at all possible there should be an RTO-wide = interconnection agreement (IA) available.  In DSTAR the stakeholder group h= ad reached a consensus that they should have a regional IA, however before = the TO's filed their informational filing with FERC they pulled the common = IA and plan on filing TO specific IA's.  (Not being familiar with state by = state rules the possibility for a multi-state RTO to actually implement a r= egion wide IA may not be possible, but we should still promote this concept= .) Penalties - Depending upon design we need to be vigilant to biased ancillar= y service and scheduling requirements and penalties. Web Site - This may be better described as market data transparency.  It wo= uld be better to be inundated with market information, as with PJM, than no= t to have information, as with the CAISO.

I wouldn't agree the caps have hurt liquidity.  In fact, in the Northwe= st at least, they have actually increased liquidity.  Any decrease in liqui= dity can be attributed primarily to a couple of things (1) uncertainty abou= t the level of the cap and (2) when the day-ahead prices trade above the ca= p (removing marketers as sellers).  I would propose the following cap timelines.  First of all, I think it's im= portant that FERC realize the ""spot"" market really is two separate markets,=  what we call the ""day-ahead"" cash markets, and ""day-of"" real-time markets.=   The 24-hour designation doesn't dovetail with the current market timeline= s and is a source of confusion that can adversely affect liquidity and disp= atch of power plants.  For example, day-ahead cash typically trades from 6:= 00 am to approximately 7:00 am for next day deliveries.  However, on Thursd= ays the WSCC OTC market trades for Friday and Saturday deliveries, and on F= ridays, we trade for Sunday and Monday (all of this can be adjusted for var= ious reasons, but this is the typical schedule).  If we held to the 24-hour=  spot cap literally, then Tuesday thru Friday the cap would apply to the da= y-ahead market, but would not apply to Saturday and Monday.  This obviously=  cannot be an intended consequence.  I recommend the cap timeline be consis= tent with the day-ahead WSCC OTC trading timelines.  In addition, there is some question with respect to what cap applies to the=  day-ahead market.  What if the forecast calls for much higher temperatures=  and it is assured that real-time markets will be trading above the 85% thr= eshold?  Assume that stage I, II or even III is a certainty.  It seems prud= ent that a higher day-ahead price cap be established (still consistent with=  FERC's guidelines).  Why?  Because you would want units prescheduled to ha= ve high reserve margins going into real-time, rather than scrambling to dis= patch units real-time.  It seems like it would be prudent for some independ= ent board to set the day-ahead price cap equal to either the 85% or Stage I=  limit prior to trading time.  This board would have to have regional repre= sentatives in order to be truly effective.  Establishing the cap does not h= ave to be cumbersome or time consuming, in fact, it should be fairly easy.  The cap governing real-time transactions is clear.  However, what isn't cle= ar is what happens when the new Stage I cap is actually lower than the exis= ting 85% of stage I cap.  For example, during the first couple of days in J= uly the real-time cap was operating under the 85% of Stage 1 criteria, appr= oximately $92.  The ISO hit a Stage I and Stage II and the price actually f= ell to the $70s.  This created uncertainty exactly when it shouldn't happen= .  As a result supply was apparently affected in California and the Southwe= st for a few hours across the peak.  It seems odd that prices should fall r= eal-time as reserve margins decrease.  One could argue this is a good reaso= n why caps should be tied to daily gas prices, but assuming that isn't an o= ption, I propose something like this:  The DAY BEFORE (around 2200) the CAI= SO, or preferably an independent body, would determine the real-time non-St= age cap as well as a Stage minimum.  While in a stage I, II, or III the hou= rly price would be the HIGHER of the non-stage price cap OR the recalculate= d Stage price.  If the Stage I price turned out lower, then the non-stage p= rice would be used for that hour, but the recalculated Stage I cap (and cor= responding 85% price) would apply for the NEXT operating day, and for day-a= head cash trading for the next trade day.  This provides information before=  the trading period (enhancing liquidity) and eliminates strange price move= ments during real-time.  It also fits the FERC price cap paradigm.  2.  Marketer prices.  I think there is a clear bias against marketers in th= e order.  But given the fact it seems deliberately slanted against marketer= s, there are clearly three areas where marketers should be allowed to recov= er costs that are easily demonstrable.  First would be losses at a tie into=  California.  If we sell at the cap and incurr losses, then we can't sell a= t the cap.  Second would be the 10% credit premium.  Credit issues apply wh= ether you're a marketer or generator.  Third would be call options.  It see= ms if the market trades above the cap and above the strike in a call option= , that a party should be able to exercise and sell.  I'm not sure what the = difference between a peaking plant and a call option is.

2022-04-21 06:14:02+00:00,true,3,"  First cut response to Jim's message - see below.  Please respond to me ASAP.  ISSUE:  Enron's PX credits with SCE of $---- million may be ""stranded"" if a PUC proposed decision is approved, as is expected to occur Thursday, June 28.  SCE stopped making PX credit payments January 5, 2001, supposedly because of its financial situation.  SCE asked the PUC for authority to reflect the accumulated credits on the customer's bill, and suspend any cash payments of such credits  The proposed decision grants this request.  SCE has also asked the PUC to formally clarify the manner in which PX credits are calculated.  Prior to January 19, 2001, the PX credit was based on the actual Power Exchange clearing prices.  On January 19, 2001, the Power Exchange effectively stopped operations.  SCE's proposal is to determine the PX credit post-January 19, 2001 as the weighted average of its own retained generation and QF contract costs.  The PUC has not yet said when it would rule on this issue.  Enron's position before the PUC is that the credit should continue to be based on a market measure, like NP 15 and SP 15 indices.  Enron's P X credits with SCE could become ""stranded"" if they are interpreted to accrue to the account of the individual customers receiving service and not Enron.   Once Enron's customers were re-sourced back to the utility, new account numbers were established for these accounts.  This creates a loophole which allows SCE and the PUC to interpret the accumulated credits as applying to specific customer accounts and not to services purchased by Enron.   Core Issues for a settlement with SCE on PX credit issue:  Cash payment of owed PX credits through January 18, 2001.  (For Enron, this is $123 million.)  Agreement to use SCE-proposed method of PX credit calculation starting January 19, 2001.  (Enron drops market proposal.)  PX credits accrued starting January 19, 2001 can be paid in the form of bill credits to any account so designated by the Energy Service Provider for receipt of such credits.  (Enron credits are transferable to services rendered for other Enron customers.)   Other SCE debts (????) are not called in immediately.

2022-04-21 08:10:57+00:00,false,3,"  Alan,  This is a very valid question and one which was asked by Steve Hall about 6 weeks ago.  We have been working with the ISO the get the following information.  Based on the latest information provided by the ISO Client Reps.  Enron would be eligible for receiving part of the Allocation.  There were some questions regarding this in the past because, the tariff was written in our favor to receive part of this allocation but the Settlement documentation by the ISO did not represent the same.  Per John Gooden at the ISO  The CT 1480 is used to allocate the revenues received by the ISO through CT 480.  Such revenues will be allocated to the SCs with a positive Uninstructed Demand Deviation and to those with a negative Uninstructed Demand Deviation with a magnitude less than or equal to 5% of the metered Demand.  These SCs will receive revenues based on the ratio of each SC's metered demand to the sum of all such SCs metered demand in the control area.  Chris Stokley has placed a request with the ISO to provide us with information indicating how much of this has been allocated to Enron.  If they are truly calculating this today they should not have any problems providing this information.  If you have any additional questions please let me know.  Thanks - MO    ","Alan, this is a very valid question and one which was asked by Steve Hall about 6 weeks ago. We have been working with the ISO to get the following information.

2022-04-21 11:03:12+00:00,true,4,"  Note:  I had been sending the Arctic market intelligence to John Goodpasture.   Is your group primary on the project now, or do I continue to send to someone else?  Let me know.   Arctic Resources Gains Key Aboriginal Support for Northern Pipe  Arctic Resources Co., the upstart that only last year entered the myriad of pipeline proposals to move northern gas into the Lower 48, moved a few steps closer to fulfilling its dream of building a pipeline from Alaska's Prudhoe Bay to Edmonton, AB, last week by earning the endorsement of key Canadian aboriginal leaders.  The cornerstone of ARC's approach is to build a consortium of political, producer, transportation and regional leaders; without aboriginal support, the plan would never succeed. However, Bob Murphy, point man for Houston-based ARC, said Friday that if all continues to go well, ""gas could be flowing by 2006.""  Last week, aboriginal leaders representing the Sahtu landowners and the Alberta First Nations agreed to endorse the project, including its approach to providing pipeline management by aboriginal and Native American groups involved in the governance of the project.  The Deh Cho, said Murphy, who also occupy a significant portion of the land through which a pipeline will travel, are now considering the proposal, and Murphy said he was optimistic.  ""Together, Sahtu and Deh Cho lands represent over 70% of the land in the Northwest Territories, through which a pipeline would travel,"" he said. Gaining aboriginal support is key to any pipeline to the Lower 48, he said.  ARC's Northern Gas Pipeline Project would create a natural gas pipeline extending from Prudhoe Bay in Alaska through and under the Beaufort Sea, coming onshore in northern Canada and extending through the Mackenzie River Valley to interconnects in Edmonton. Following a ramp-up period, ARC estimates it would transport 4 Bcf/d through the high-pressure 1,200 mile, fully entrenched route.  The pipeline would cost $4 billion, and financing and reserves would add another $1 billion to the cost, which would be 100% debt financed. The debt financing would lower the tariffs, making it attractive to shippers, promoters say. Murphy said he's hopeful that by the end of the year, ARC could begin its pre-application permitting process, but he added there was still much to be accomplished.  ""The ARC approach is all inclusive,"" Murphy told NGI. ""We fully intend to gain the support of all of the parties because we are offering a balanced approach to project management. We believe our approach is far more than just a route. That's important to understand. Our approach offers the least expensive, the lowest tariff,"" he said. ""Politically, we have to take care of Canadian interests. We have to take care of the political issues in Canada, and that includes bringing the aboriginal regions in. You have to do that to succeed.""  ARC's proactive approach combines Canadian aboriginal and Native American interests that line the pipeline route with an independent business consortium under the company's umbrella, Murphy said. The balance of interests of the competing stakeholders offers the type of business discipline ""that will be required by the capital markets and industry.""  What ARC gained last week was a Framework Memorandum, executed by the Ernie MacDonald Land Corp. (EMLC), one of six Sahtu landowners whose territory would be crossed by the pipeline. The memorandum was structured to include participation of other aboriginal landowners following briefings in their communities. The Fort Norman Metis Land Corp. also agreed to join EMLC as a signatory to the memorandum.  EMLC President Larry Tourangeau said that he believed the ""interests of Canada, the United States, industry, the environment and aboriginal people are best served by an initial single, cost-effective pipeline that connects both northern Canada and Alaska to southern markets without damaging either Canadian or Alaskan resources.""  What EMLC also likes, and what Murphy hopes ARC can convince other aboriginal leaders of as well, is that ARC will give the affected aboriginal regions control over the pipeline --- an approach not used by other competing proposals. ""We believe that aboriginal ownership and involvement, as proposed in the ARC approach, will improve the prospects for a safe, timely and economic project,"" said Tourangeau.  ARC Chairman Forrest Hoglund, who spearheaded the efforts of former Exxon Corp. in its unfulfilled plans to build a natural gas pipeline from Alaska almost 30 years ago, said the endorsement of aboriginal leaders ""marks a major milestone to getting to the right answer quickly on this important project."" He called the ""one pipeline approach with aboriginal support"" the ""fastest, lowest cost, best environmental and best political approach"" for the region.  Now it's on to gaining more support, and beginning the critical step of establishing a special purpose committee, Murphy said. The SPC would be organized and created under Canadian law and owned by certain aboriginal groups whose lands the pipeline crosses. Similar provisions would be offered for the Alaskan region, he said.  Murphy said ARC is now working with the producers interested in an Alaskan pipeline, as well as political leaders in Canada and Washington, DC. When asked how producer involvement was going, Murphy said the companies were ""doing the type of work anyone would need to do"" to study which option would be best for their companies.  ""At the same time, we're certainly hopeful that they're going to want to perceive this route as the far more economical one and the one with the best political approach,"" Murphy said. ""Of course, the economics of the project matter, but politics matter too. Pipelines have to work economically and not just at $9 gas. This is a long-term project, and we've put a great deal of emphasis on the business sense of it.""  ARC's proposal is not the only one on the drawing board, but so far, none have gotten further than the proposal stage. No applications have been applied for yet by any of the competing proposals, which include two other major proposals:  The Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS): The ANGTS was approved in September 1977 by President Jimmy Carter and the U.S. Congress. The proposal envisions a 5,000-mile joint U.S.-Canadian overland pipeline that would deliver up to 2.5 Bcf/d to the Lower 48. Portions of ANGTS already have been completed, with more than 2,600 miles along two legs from Alberta into the United States.

2022-04-21 02:23:03+00:00,true,4,"  Pipes on the Way for Constrained Rockies  As natural gas prices in the Rocky Mountain region over the last few months have fallen much further than other areas of the country due primarily to transportation constraints, the question becomes, why is the region currently experiencing a frenzy of exploration and production activity, when pricing signals point toward restraint? The answer, according to Raymond James & Associates analyst Wayne Andrews, is that new pipeline infrastructure is on its way to the region, and in a big hurry.  ""While Henry Hub gas prices have fallen from the mid $7/Mcf range to below $4/Mcf, Rocky Mountain gas prices have fallen from the mid $7/Mcf range to below $3/Mcf,"" Andrews said in the company's Stat of the Week report. ""This basis pricing differential between the Rockies and other areas has widened considerably as pipeline limitations have created a gas supply chain bottleneck.""  Andrews explained that the Rockies/Henry Hub differential has historically widened during the summer months, and narrowed during the winter when gas demand is at its peak. The fluctuation occurs because midstream companies can charge higher transportation rates when demand is low, forcing producers to realize a discount price for their gas.  ""Nevertheless, prior to 2000, increasing export capacity from the Rockies and modest volume increases kept the differential below $0.50/MMBtu,"" Andrews said. ""More recently, however, the boom in drilling activity during the past several years has caused production out of the region to outpace additions to infrastructure, effectively amplifying the differential problem. In fact, the Rockies/Henry Hub differential peaked near $1.30/MMBtu last summer before receding during the winter months, and has already reached that level again this summer. Consequently, some Rocky Mountain natural gas producers may not be able to meet expectations for earnings and cash flow because they are realizing lower prices.""  But studies have shown that the area is large and filled with precious long-life reserves, and once adequate pipeline infrastructure is in place, the exploration and production (E&P) companies in the region will be able to produce at capacity.  Andrews suggested that while many analysts normally take the conservative route regarding natural gas price assumptions, many this year did not take into account such a wide basis differential. In the near term, the analyst advises production companies in the area to hedge production and/or the basis differential when the pricing environment is favorable. He also said that locking in firm transportation capacity agreements to erase seasonal peaks and valleys in the differential can also help.  As for the long run, Andrews said that midstream pipeline expansion in the Rockies will ""ultimately eliminate the differential problem."" According to the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States (IPAMS), more than nine new and expansion projects totaling over 3 Bcf of incremental capacity are currently expected to be complete before November 2003, with four additional projects with unreleased in-service dates.  To accommodate the growing Powder River Basin production, Fort Union Gas Gathering LLC announced plans in January for a 200 MMcf/d expansion of capacity on its system (see Daily GPI, Jan. 18 <d20010118h.html>). IPAMS said the company now expects to be finished with the expansion ahead of schedule this month, as opposed to the company's previous expectations of the fourth quarter.  Also jumping into the fray, Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) and BP America Inc. reported on Monday that they have entered into a 12-year agreement to expand gathering and processing infrastructure and services to accommodate BP's Greater Green River Basin drilling program in Wamsutter, WY (see related story this issue).  ""Overall, this expanded infrastructure will enable new gas supplies to be delivered to consumers within the Midwest market areas,"" said Steve Blossom, asset manager for BP.  ""The bottom line is that widening Rockies/Henry Hub basis differentials will likely prove to be a short-term, seasonal issue and not have a material longer-term effect on activity or company valuations in the Rockies,"" Andrews said. ""That being said, the potential for those basis differentials to remain large or even widen further, increases the possibility of some producers falling short of their earnings estimates in the near term.""  Andrews added that many E&P companies in the region have already taken measures to protect against the differential and will not be affected greatly. The hustle and bustle of recent E&P and pipeline activity in the region are evidence of the vastness and potential of the Rocky Mountain play, he said.

2022-04-21 07:58:55+00:00,true,4,"  CIG Plans New Line From Rockies to Midcontinent  Colorado Interstate Gas has announced an open season running through July 20 for a new pipeline to transport Rocky Mountain gas from the Cheyenne Hub to connections in the Midcontinent area near Greensburg, KS.  CIG said it has completed the archaeological, environmental and right-of-way surveys necessary to file an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by this coming October and complete the pipeline by late 2003. The company said it ""has been working with interested shippers in developing this pipeline project over the past year in response to concerns that Rocky Mountain gas supplies could exceed pipeline takeaway capacity.""  The line would consist of 380 miles of 30-inch pipe and 17,000 hp of compression to carry about 540 MDth/d of gas. Planned interconnects include ANR Pipeline, CMS Panhandle Eastern, Northern Natural Gas, Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Williams.  Based on the current design, the transport rate would be 28 cents/Dth, plus an estimated 0.8% fuel and unaccounted for gas, and any authorized surcharges such as an ACA charge. Prospective shippers are asked to complete an offer sheet for a 10-year contract, stating their maximum daily quantity, receipt and delivery points, acceptance of the 100% load factor rate of 28 cents/Dth, and any other conditions required of the shipper.  CIG will notify winning bidders by July 23 and execute binding precedent agreements for firm transportation by Aug. 17, 2001.

2022-04-21 03:14:54+00:00,true,4,"  Energy Insight News for Thursday, June 21, 2001 Is ANWR DOA?  President George W. Bush's withdrawal from the Kyoto protocol process sparked a response that he clearly did not expect, both at home and abroad. Indeed, this and other recent events suggest the American public is significantly more engaged in environmental issues than the administration believed.  Despite attempts to repair this image with photo ops in the Everglades and elsewhere-moves that played in the mainstream press as hopelessly contrived-the president's strategy has eroded support among environmentally conscious moderates and threatens development initiatives that require this trust.  A recent Washington Post-ABC News Poll concluded that a full 58% of the public disapproves of how President Bush is handling the energy situation, an increase of 15% since a survey conducted four weeks ago. Further, half of the public disapproves of his actions on environmental issues, up 9% since April, while 41% approve.  Given this, there is growing speculation that the fight to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) may be over-before it even began-especially now that the Democrats have Senate control. ""We already think we have the votes in the Senate, even by simple majority [without a filibuster] to defeat any bill that includes arctic drilling,"" said Melinda Pierce, spokesperson for the Sierra Club.  This begs the question: Why is the Bush administration showing such tenacity on this issue?  ""While President Bush may be fulfilling campaign promises, there is also the idea circulating that this is a stalking horse,"" speculates Pierce. President Bush may be pushing ANWR, despite continued setbacks, in order to eventually ""give in."" This could give him a legislative bargaining chip to get access to other restricted areas in, for example, the Rocky Mountains. Read the entire story at http://www.energyinsight.com.

2022-04-21 11:00:05+00:00,true,4,"  Report Pessimistic on Planned Power Plants  Less than half of the electric power plants now in development in the United States are likely to be completed, according to an analysis of electricity and natural gas supply and demand by an energy analyst with the Williams Capital Group LP, a New York-based investment bank.  While those new facilities that actually do get built will ease tight power markets and alleviate political pressures to control prices in the near term, high gas prices and electricity price volatility are likely to continue, according to Christopher Ellinghaus, an energy analyst with Williams Capital. Only if new coal-fired or nuclear power plants come on line in significant numbers, are shortages likely to be abated, the analysis noted. But Ellinghaus pointed out that bringing new coal-fired or nuclear power plants on line at any significant level cannot happen until 2005.  Although independent power producers and other electricity suppliers hope to have 300,000 MW of new generating capacity on line by 2005, it is doubtful that much more than 100,000 MW will be possible over the next three years, Ellinghaus asserted. He attributed the difference to infrastructure constraints, including U.S. energy policy, public attitudes toward new facilities and anemic growth of natural gas supplies, the fuel to be used in over 90% of the proposed plants.  Pointing out that gas supplies have been growing by less than 1% annually despite record drilling activity, Ellinghaus warned that unless unprecedented amounts of new, net gas production emerge over the next three to five years, only a fraction, perhaps 40% to 45%, of the natural gas-fired plants currently being developed will actually be constructed.  Demand for electricity is likely to grow by 3% annually through 2010, Ellinghaus forecasted. That rate reflects the fundamental shift in the U.S. economy that has made electricity-intensive technologies such as computers, telecommunications and the Internet the engines of U.S. economic growth.  To meet this demand and build sufficient reserves to avoid price shocks, U.S. power generators would have to build 330,000 MW of new and replacement capacity by 2010, a 41.7% increase from the 822,000 MW of capacity in 2000. If all the new plants were gas fired, demand for natural gas would grow by between 11 and 15 Tcf, requiring the gas market to grow from 22.4 Tcf to between 33 and 38 Tcf.  The analyst said that in order to meet that demand, natural gas supply would have to increase by 9% annually. Based on production experience over the last decade, it is doubtful that such a level of increased production could be achieved, Ellinghaus said. Most gas exploration and production analysts expect an annual growth rate in the 1% to 3% range.  There will be adequate gas supply to the fuel new plants being built this year and next, when 43,000 MW and 36,000 MW of new generating capacity are expected to come on line, Ellinghaus said. However, in subsequent years there only would be enough gas supply to support 20,000 MW of new plant construction. ""Natural gas remains the principal constraint to completing and operating plants currently in development.""  As a consequence of insufficient gas supplies, power generators would have to build 200,000 MW of generating capacity fueled by coal or uranium to meet long-term demand, Ellinghaus stated. However, because of the lengthy development cycle and public policy concerns, new plants relying on these energy sources will not begin to come on line in sufficient numbers until 2005 or 2006..

2022-04-21 22:11:35+00:00,true,4,"  Producers Indicate North Slope's Beaufort Route May Get Nod  In what would be a major blow to Alaska officials, especially Gov. Tony Knowles who has pinned the remainder of his term toward getting an Alaska Highway natural gas pipeline, major producers indicated this week that because the cost would be less, they now favor a North Slope pipeline that would move north, through the Beaufort Sea, instead of across the state.  Ken Konrad, a BP executive, testifying during two days of hearings before the Alaska legislature's Joint Committee on Natural Gas Pipelines, told the committee that an analysis ""so far indicates that the northern route appears more cost efficient than a southern route."" Konrad also noted that with a Beaufort line, gas reserves in the Mackenzie River delta also could be taken -- which would be a major victory for Canadian officials.  Konrad and other stakeholders, including producers, analysts and government officials involved in moving gas from the North Slope, were asked to speak before the joint committee and offer their insight on where the project could be headed.  BP and partners Exxon Mobil and Phillips Petroleum, the majority property rights' holders on the North Slope, have been analyzing various routes for a proposed pipe since last fall, which basically would either move supply across the state or go north under the Beaufort Sea and into Canada on a trek toward the Lower 48.  The producer consortium, the North American Natural Gas Pipeline Group, is spending close to $100 million to evaluate the routes and has indicated it could file an application on one of the routes with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) by the end of this year. Konrad's testimony, as well as comments made during the hearings, indicate that the desire of Alaska officials to keep the pipe inside the state may fall apart.  What appears to be the deal maker or breaker is cost. Konrad said only ""a few dimes"" separate the two major proposals, but transportation costs per thousand Btus would pick up savings in lower investment costs with a shorter pipe and lower operating costs. Economists have estimated the rate for bringing gas to the Lower 48 from the North Slope will be around $2.25/MMBtu. A shorter pipe overall would lead to substantial savings, especially on a project that Konrad noted faces serious challenges economically.  Joe Maruschack, Phillips' natural gas pipeline chief, said his group is aware of the ""deep reservations"" Alaskan officials have about a Beaufort route, but also indicated that problems associated with the Beaufort route could be risky as well. He cited environmental opposition from aboriginal groups, which would have to approve the routing, construction on a sea route, logistical challenges and additional permitting as part of a daunting, and lengthy task.  If the consortium and other producers chose the Beaufort route, Maruschack indicated that they could explore some way to bring gas to Alaska's residents south of the North Slope. But in Alaska, it's about more than the supply. This past spring the Alaska legislature, with strong support from Knowles, passed a law to prevent construction of a Beaufort route (see Daily GPI, March 30 <d20010330d.html>). Without Alaska's support, the Beaufort route could also face defeat.  ""We're coming to a divergence,"" said Harold Heinze, the former Alaska Natural Resources Department commissioner and a former energy executive. ""There's a big difference between maximizing the profitability of companies and maximizing the benefit to the state.""  Ken Thompson, a former Atlantic Richfield executive and president of Arco Alaska Inc., said one compromise would be to offer tax breaks for building along the Alaska Highway. ""They could pressure the governor and the legislature to make a deal,"" he told the committee.  Roger Marks, a State of Alaska oil and gas economist who has studied the proposed projects, said the cost savings could be as much as $2 billion using the Beaufort route, which would be about 200 miles shorter than an Alaska Highway route. Total construction costs, according to Konrad, now range between $15 billion and $20 billion.  ""Several dimes from your transportation costs could remove a lot of risks,"" Marks told the committee.  Meanwhile, Alaska remains committed to getting a pipe through the state. Foothills Pipe Lines Alaska Inc. signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the state on Thursday to complete its review of the Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co.'s previously filed right-of-way lease application to construct and operate the highway pipe. Foothills constructed what exists so far of the Alaska gas line and remains a proponent of the trans-Alaska route.  U.S. and Canadian law has designated the ANNGTC, a partnership of Foothills and TransCanada PipeLines, to construct and operate the Alaska portion. Foothills and its affiliates would construct and operate the Canadian portion.  ""This agreement is an important step in completing our land position for this project,"" said John Ellwood, Foothills vice president. ""Together with 400 miles of right-of-way we have on federal lands in Alaska and our extensive right-of-way in Canada, we are in an excellent position to expedite the building of the pipe.""  Ellwood said the application review, together with the existing permits and FERC and National Energy Board of Canada certificates, underlines the timing advantage of a trans-Alaska route advocated by Foothills and its shareholder companies, Westcoast Energy and TransCanada.  ""One thing that everyone in Washington (DC) and Anchorage agree on is that getting North Slope gas to the Lower 48 is a priority, and our approved route along the Alaska Highway through Canada can deliver that gas two-to-three years earlier than any greenfield project,"" Ellwood said. ""We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to advance this project and that has enhanced our ability to deliver Alaska gas to the Lower 48.""  ","Producers Indicate North Slope's Beaufort Route May Get Nod In what would be a major blow to Alaska officials, especially Gov. Tony Knowles, who has pinned the remainder of his term toward getting an Alaska Highway natural gas pipeline, major producers indicated this week that because the cost is"
2022-04-21 17:47:35+00:00,false,4,"  CERA Analyst Gives Alaska Gas Pipe 60% Chance by 2008  When natural gas prices were sky high a year ago, the ""window looked wide open"" for the long awaited Alaska natural gas pipe, which would carry supplies from the North Slope to the Lower 48, but realistically, ""it's never been a slam dunk,"" said Ed Small, an analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates based in Canada. He also cautioned that producers will have to have the Alaskan government's blessing on the chosen route, or it would be a ""fatal flaw in the process.""  Small, who will testify next week before the Alaska State Legislature's Joint Committee on Natural Gas Pipelines, said Thursday that instead of making it easier to build the pipe, politics seem to actually be making it more difficult now than ever before. Besides the political climate, which pits Alaska's elected leaders against Alberta's -- where the pipe would be laid under one proposal, Small also sees a two-fold problem on the supply side.  ""On the demand side, when high prices showed, demand went down, and probably will not come back like it did before,"" he said. ""The economy slowing down has helped in the perception of weakness and demand softness."" Of the predictions that the North American gas demand will reach 30 Tcf in the next 20 years, Small said that CERA analysts had ""never been a proponent of a 30 Tcf world, and now it's less plausible than probable."" That in itself will lower expectations of an Alaska pipeline, he said.  Part of the demand problem is actually laying the pipe, and Small pointed to the infrastructure it will take, which he said will require no stopping once it really begins. ""If you overlay the reality of the world, to bring the kind of supply to make it worthwhile from Alaska would require a huge infrastructure, which I don't see happening by 2007. Maybe 2010, or maybe 2015, but it's just so huge.""  The second part of the dilemma facing an Alaskan pipeline is the incredible growth in the liquefied natural gas market, which has seen an enormous amount of activity from both majors and independents since the beginning of this year (see related story).  ""LNG is going to be competition to Alaskan gas,"" Small said. ""The demand problem has brought out a lot of potential responses, and LNG is one of them. It has changed the landscape, and so it changes the outlook for the pipe."" While he said that the economics are actually comparable from Arctic gas and new greenfield LNG facilities, ""LNG can be different on a scale regarding the cost and it has more of an environmental footprint than a 3,500-mile gas pipeline.""  However, not all of the LNG announcements made thus far will be completed, Small noted. ""As projects are announced, it's what's going to be built that puts the actual question into Arctic gas.""  Despite what he called his ""realistic"" rather than ""negative"" attitude toward the pipe, Small said that laying it will be such a ""monumental undertaking that it may develop a life of its own regardless. The need for gas may be more than adequate to overcome any obstacles."" However, he cautioned that the obstacles were only getting higher.  ""Alaska has drawn a line in the sand, and without getting into the legality of that, what that does is set the tone,"" Small said of the Alaska legislature and Gov. Tony Knowles moving to ensure the pipe is built the way the state wants it built, regardless.  Meanwhile, Alberta also has sort of drawn a line in the sand, Small said, which is important, because at least one-third of the pipeline would move through the province.  ""From the sheer cost of it, it doesn't need any obstacles,"" he said. ""Those kinds of things are stumbling blocks."" Besides the government officials working to ensure they not upset constituents, Small said there also are the rights-of-way that have to be obtained and a lot of other work to be done behind the scenes.  ""At this juncture, it's in the producers hands, and they say they will make a decision by the end of the year, but I'm skeptical of that,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean it won't be built. But if (the producers' route decision) is contrary to the Alaskan government, it may be a fatal flaw in the entire process.""  The key, he said, is in the economies of scale. ""The bigger they make it, the more impact it will have on the market. A huge pipeline would have a huge impact on the market."" In his opinion, the total pipeline's capacity, which includes Alaska, the Mackenzie Delta supplies and any LNG facilities built, would be a ""maximum of 4 Bcf/d.""

2022-04-21 07:22:36+00:00,false,4,"  New Generation Starts Up in CA; Others Drop Out  Although California officials are gaining optimism from new electric generation plants finally coming on line today and in the next two weeks, there are signs that the electron rush of the past few years may peter out if the current uncertainties surrounding the state's electricity markets continue to fester.  The state's chief cheerleader for new supply, conservation and federally ordered suppliers refunds, Gov. Gray Davis today takes his pom-poms to the oil fields southwest of Bakersfield to flip the switch on a new 320-MW, simple-cycle cogeneration plant developed by Edison Mission Energy and Texaco Power and Gasification, whose supplies are totally dedicated to the state at about six cents/kwh, with a $4.40/MMBtu natural gas price over 10 years.  But current generators and other developers of new plants are expressing caution toward continued unabated development of new plants, given pending state legislation that would impose windfall taxes and/or possible confiscation of private-sector generating plants, in addition to a law on the books that makes criminal acts of market manipulation by generators, if proven to be the case in court. (Most legislative proposals exempt new plants, however.)  Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. said earlier this month that it is holding up its plans for new plants, even though it recently won state approval to build a new 530 MW plant in the East San Francisco Bay suburbs, and it has proposed building a new plant in electron-starved San Francisco. Mirant placed the plans on hold until it feels the state political and economic climate has stabilized.  And a Reliant Energy executive told stock market analysts Tuesday he would not be surprised to see delays and even cancellations of power projects throughout the West because of uncertain prices and the strange political environment (see related story, this issue).  Another large generating company operating in California recently told NGI, any further projects it had been considering in California were ""off the screen,"" and had been ""pushed back to a study mode, at best."" The generator, caught up in the current round of lawsuits, declined to be named.  Although he admits some generators ""want to wait a little bit,"" Steve Larson, executive director of the California Energy Commission, which okays all major power plants, said, ""generally speaking, the rush is still on. There are still people applying, so as far as we can tell. People are still coming to us with their energy projects and want them sited as quickly as possible."" (About 7,800 MW are under construction, the energy commission said.)  ""We don't have a shortage of people wanting to build plants here in the state,"" said one of Davis's spokespeople, Roger Salazar.  In the public sector, the nation's largest municipal utility, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, has delayed plans on beginning construction of a 500 MW repowering project at an existing 325 MW power plant in the San Fernando Valley section of the city, because of problems with the local electrical workers' union that complained about the winning bidder being a nonunion contractor. LADWP said it could be delayed up to six months to allow the project to be re-bid.  In the meantime, although not necessarily counted in the governor's highly promoted new power plants, LADWP is moving ahead with five new 50 MW peaking plants at existing plant sites, as part of a $1.5 billion integrated resource plan for the next five years.  The governor stressed the accelerated time frame in which the Sunrise plant began construction on Dec. 7, 2000, making it operational in a record-setting 6.5 months. The construction force worked 18-hour days, six days a week, and the plant was brought on 32 days ahead of schedule. (Edison's MOU with the governor included financial incentives to get the plant on line early.)  That makes it eligible for more than $1 million in construction incentive payments under the Governor's Executive Order (D-32). By the summer of 2003, it will have an output of 585 MW. As a single-cycle plant, the authority to operate runs for only 18 months, or this and next year's summers. It will be expanded and brought on as a combined-cycle, cogeneration and baseload unit for a longer time period.  The plant is the first major one to start up since Davis took office. Two more are coming on line in the next two weeks. More than 4,000 MW of new power is expected to be online by the end of summer, in what the governor and his people are dubbing as ""a California success story.""

Williams filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on March 15 for a certificate of approval to proceed with the expansion project, adding 135,000 dekatherms per day of firm transportation service from Wyoming to California.  ""We received FERC approval within three weeks of filing - an unprecedented turnaround. This allowed us to expedite the construction process and bring additional supplies of natural gas to the California market,"" said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River. ""We anticipate most of the new natural gas will go directly to power generation facilities.""  The emergency expansion project added two new compressor stations in Utah and one in California, as well as upgraded compressor units at three existing compressor stations in Wyoming, Utah and Nevada. The installation of these facilities increased the transportation capacity on Kern River by approximately 19 percent. Williams completed the multimillion project more than three weeks ahead of schedule.  ""The extraordinary effort put forth by our contractors, employees and permitting agencies resulted in a successful completion of the project ahead of schedule,"" stated Micheal Dunn, manager of project management for Kern River.  With a system that spans the continental United States, Williams' gas pipeline unit is one of the nation's largest-volume transporters of natural gas. The company is based in Houston and has offices in Salt Lake City and Owensboro, Ky. The gas pipeline unit's Kern River Gas Transmission operates a 922-mile system delivering Rocky Mountain and Canadian natural gas to markets in California, Nevada, and Utah.

2022-04-21 06:06:24+00:00,true,4,"  Gas Pipeline Rush is Alive, Well in NW  Nature's severe downturn in the amounts of hydroelectricity in the western region over the past 12 months has been a giant wake-up call for natural gas as new gas-fired power plants are spurring an unprecedented rush to build added interstate pipeline transmission into Washington and Oregon.  PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) announced it has new binding precedent agreements with 25-year terms totaling about 250 MMcf/d based on a open season concluded in mid-June in the Pacific Northwest. This is for an expansion in 2003 and is in addition to earlier announced expansions for next year, which are currently pending before the FERC and will add about 200 MMcf/d of firm capacity to the system. New power generation makes up almost all the growth to be served by the expansions.  Williams' Northwest Pipeline last week announced yet another expansion--its fourth in less than a year--in the state of Washington, all involving proposed new electric generating plants and collectively representing hundreds of millions of new daily capacity into a state that used little other than wood and hydroelectric energy until the last few decades of the 20th Century. Besides the recently announced $200 million, 276-MMcf/d, 26-mile Evergreen Pipeline expansion to fuel several new power plants in western Washington, Northwest already is pushing ahead with plans for three other pipeline expansions:  Nine miles of 20-inch diameter pipeline, the Everett Delta Project, will be completed in August 2002, bringing 86 MMcf/d of new gas supplies to fuel a power plant under construction by an affiliate of Florida Power and Light, FPL Energy, in the fastest growing area in the state, Snohomish County, on former industrial property owned by Weyerhaeuser.  A 50-mile expansion, the Grays Harbor Lateral, in the area around the state capital of Olympia, WA, to serve a 600 MW combined-cycle power plant (Satsop Development Park) Duke Energy intends to build. The $75 million project is schedule to be completed in November 2002.  The Georgia Strait Project in far northwest Washington will extend underwater to Vancouver Island in British Columbia. It includes 84 miles of new pipeline to two new power plants slated to be built. The $159 million expansion and joint effort between Northwest and BC Hydro is scheduled to be completed in the fall of 2003; federal approvals on both sides of the Canadian border were applied for last spring.  Underscoring this effort by Williams and the similar proposed expansions by PG&E GTN is the well-recognized fact that the Pacific Northwest historically relied too heavily on one energy source--hydro. Officials at the Northwest Power Planning Council and within the individual energy companies headquartered in the region are now hooked on new gas-fired generation as are all of the western states.  ""The overwhelming reason for high power prices is scarcity, borne largely from sharply higher-than-expected demand growth, and the savage downturn in hydroelectricity supplies,"" wrote energy consultants Samuel A. Van Vactor and Frederick Pickel in a technical article on deregulation published earlier this year.

2022-04-21 19:38:15+00:00,true,4,"  Foothills CEOs Says Canada to Gain With Alaska Pipe  Canadians are being assured by their two biggest natural gas transporters that they don't have to take sides in the contest over the northern pipelines because they stand to gain no matter which project wins. After carrying an estimated C$40 billion worth (US$27 billion) of exports to the United States in the past 20 years, the ""prebuild"" of the Alaska pipeline, completed by Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd., predicts that far from losing, Canadians stand to gain if the country can build the missing northern link in the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS).  Permanent benefits for all Canadian users of the pipeline grid are projected by Foothills co-CEOs Michael Stewart and Dennis McConaghy. Stewart is executive vice-president for business development for Westcoast Energy Inc. and McConaghy is his counterpart at TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. Foothills remains the sole owner of ANGTS's sponsor, Alaska Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., after nine U.S. partners in the original 1970s version of the project dropped out during its long dormant spell.  In an interview, Stewart called Foothills a pipeline counterpart to ""the little engine that could,"" referring to the old children's story book. ""Except it's not so little,"" he said. Initially installed as an early start on southern legs in the mega-project in order to help finance the far costlier northern section, Foothills now carries about 35% of Canadian gas exports. Stewart described the reviving prospects of completing ANGTS as a further service -- this time in ""optimizing"" use of the Canadian pipeline grid.  McConaghy believes that by completing the missing northern link, Canada would benefit, and Foothills has taken that case to the National Energy Board (NEB). The arrival of Alaskan gas into the 3.3 Bcf/d Foothills system would allow Canadian production to move over to TransCanada and Westcoast without forcing them to fight the new Alliance Pipeline and associated eastern links, the Vector and proposed Millennium systems. As a result,Canadians would shed the burden of costs associated with excess capacity that has emerged as a result of aggressive pipeline construction since the mid-1990s.  Capacity grew so much that Natural Resources Canada estimates refilling the routes to the Lower 48 will require exports from the western provinces of about 3.8 Tcf/year - - or nearly one-third more than early-1990s industry planners estimated the region's gas fields could support on a sustained basis. Despite production increases generated by a record drilling pace over the past year, McConaghy estimated that the pipeline grid still has 1.5-2 Bcf of excess daily capacity. That poses a problem of ""defraying fixed costs,"" in his words.  The problem drives an application by TransCanada to the NEB for a raise in its effective rate of return to 12.5% from 9.6%. The hike is sought to cover costs of lost traffic and compensate for increased business risks posed by the glutted, competitive Canadian market for gas-transportation services. Potentially long, hard-fought hearings are planned into how much of a raise to allow and how to translate it into toll increases for shippers still bound to use TransCanada by long delivery contracts.  TransCanada has told the NEB it does not expect the cost pressure to end any time soon, if ever. At current gas discovery, sales and reserves depletion rates, TransCanada projects that the production capability of the entire Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin is liable to peak and slip into decline within eight to 13 years. Some of the strain is expected to originate within the Canadian petroleum industry as it turns increasingly for its oil supplies to heavy crude and the oil sands, employing gas-fired heat extraction processes.  Use of gas by oil sands mining complexes is projected to triple by 2010 to 590 MMcf/d from 190 MMcf/d. Gas use by heavy-oil operations is expected to grow almost as fast, to 730 MMcf/d in 2010 from 270 MMcf/d. Gas-fired power generation in western Canada, which is also associated with industrial expansion, is forecast to consume 980 MMcf/d by 2010, compared to 490 MMcf/d last year.  When will Alaskan gas arrive to take some of the pressure off western Canadian supplies? Foothills estimates it will take five years from the time when a decision is made to go ahead on building the northern connection. That includes two years of planning, securing transportation contracts, procuring materials and satisfying regulatory and environmental requirements, followed by three years of construction.  Stewart and McConaghy are not predicting when the decision to go ahead will be made, although they are continuing to advance the mega-project through preliminaries such as nailing down rights-of-way. The Foothills CEOs expect no more than hints to emerge about when the talk about the northern revival will turn into action from hearings in Anchorage, before a natural gas pipelines committee set up by the Alaska State Legislature July 17 and 18. They expect a key element -- a plan by the owners of Prudhoe Bay gas, BP, Exxon Mobil and Phillips Petroleum -- to take much longer to come together. Current schedules for their feasibility studies indicate it will take until the end of the year for the reports to be completed, then as much as six months longer for corporate decisions on whether to proceed to development, with BP and Exxon Mobil making comparisons between Alaskan prospects and the rest of their global inventories of projects.  Foothills suggests that the northern planning exercise is evolving into a ""two-pipeline world"" and reports that it is going beyond its ANGTS interests to try to get in on proposals for a Mackenzie Valley line. Stewart and McConaghy expect markets for gas and transportation capacity to decide which line to build when, although they add that governments can make a big difference with decisions on items such as passing on delivery costs to consumers. The Foothills executives predict Canada will honor the treaty that created ANGTS if the Alaskan project is revived.

2022-04-21 08:36:14+00:00,true,4,"  PG&E GT-NW Plans Lateral Across Washington State  PG&E Gas Transmission-Northwest (GTN) said it received market requests for about three times the capacity on a proposed lateral that would cross Washington and compete with Northwest Pipeline for rapidly expanding power generation markets in the western half of the state along the I-5 highway corridor. GTN closed its open season for the Washington Lateral Project June 22. It was the third open season for a GTN pipeline expansion this year. Meanwhile Northwest Pipeline has four expansions of its own planned for the region.  ""The level of customer interest we received demonstrates the increasing demand for gas in Washington State,"" said Peter Lund, vice president of the PG&E National Energy Group, which includes GTN. Lund said GTN envisions a pipeline capable of transporting 300,000 to 400,000 Dth/d of gas. GTN said it received expressions of interest from local distributors and power generators.  The lateral would begin at GTN south of Spokane and head west to the Mid-Columbia area in central Washington, across the Cascades to the I-5 corridor in western Washington, which is served currently by only Northwest Pipeline. The ultimate route for the project has not been determined, and exact delivery points will be determined as the pipeline works out agreements with customers, the company said. ""I want you to know that Mount Rainier is in the middle of the route area we are looking at but we will not be going over Mount Rainier because it's a national park; there's no way we are going to do that,"" said a GTN spokeswoman. ""We're basically going to go from east to west over the mountains to I-5.""  The pipeline companies in the Pacific Northwest have worked themselves into an expansion frenzy with two large mainline expansions and this new state-crossing lateral planned by GTN and four large laterals, including a new line to Vancouver Island, planned by Williams' Northwest Pipeline.  The power crisis has been the primary driver. Up until the last few decades, the region has relied on hydroelectricity and wood for its power generation, but now it is turning to natural gas.

2022-04-21 21:27:47+00:00,false,4,"  Kinder Morgan Rolls: Snags Pipeline, Doubles 2Q Earnings  There's good news and then there's better news. For Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI), every day just seems to be a front-page top-of-the-fold story. Take Wednesday, for instance. Delivering on projections made earlier this month that it would meet or beat consensus earnings estimates, KMI reported great news, with a 107% boost in second quarter earnings over the same period a year ago, and year-to-date earnings up 42%. However, KMI's general limited partner Kinder Morgan Energy Partners L.P. (KMP) almost trumped the broadcast, with its announcement that it would buy a 2,600-mile Texas natural gas pipeline system for $360 million and split its stock two for one.  KMI's net income for the quarter was $49.9 million, or $0.41 per diluted common share, compared with $24.1 million, or $0.21 for the same period of 2000. During a conference call with investors, CEO Richard Kinder said earnings were driven by its pipeline partner KMP whose earnings ""more than doubled compared to the second quarter a year ago,"" adding that would be ""hard to imagine we could have had a much better quarter."" Calling KMP the ""real driver of the real growth,"" Kinder said that ""while no company can escape economic downturn, KMI is about as minimally exposed as possible.""  Kinder, who said the company is still on track to make additional acquisitions or growth plans before the end of the year, also hinted that another pipeline expansion announcement could be forthcoming. KMP, he said, is in discussions about a ""major expansion in the Rockies."" Although the West Coast is on most companies' radar screens for pipe growth, Kinder said he thought that a possible pipeline expansion ""should go east, but we're just talking."" Calling production thus far in the Rocky Mountain basin ""a great story,"" Kinder said the company had ""major advantages, and it looks pretty good so far."" He did not detail when any announcements may be made.  KMP's newest pipeline deal, with an affiliate of Occidental Petroleum Corp., includes pipe that primarily transports gas from South Texas and the Texas Gulf Coast region to the greater Houston/Beaumont area, a ""very good growth market,"" Kinder said. The assets are currently leased and operated by KMP as a major part of the Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline (KMTP) business unit. KMP also signed a five-year agreement to supply almost 90 Bcf of natural gas to chemical facilities owned by Occidental affiliates in the Houston area.  With KMP's earnings tied into KMI's, Kinder said that ""as the operator, we are very familiar with the assets involved in this transaction and their excellent growth potential."" The transaction, expected to close in the third quarter, is expected to be immediately accretive to per-unit distributions by about $0.08 annually. Under the lease terms, KMP will pay $40 million annually from 2002 through 2005 and $30 million annually through 2026.  On track to deliver more than a 40% increase in earnings per share this year, Kinder pointed to KMI's ""premier, fee-based portfolio of midstream assets,"" adding that KMI was ""comfortable"" with current 2001 consensus earnings estimates of $1.84 per share, but said KMI would raise its 2002 estimate to between $2.40 and $2.50 per share.  Breaking down its earnings by business segment, Kinder said KMI will receive $67 million in total cash distributions from KMP for the second quarter of 2001, up 81% from $37 million a year ago. ""As KMP's cash flow grows, KMI's general partner share of that cash flow grows dramatically,"" he said. ""KMI's cash flow from KMP increased significantly due to internal growth in KMP's pipeline and terminal segments and the strong performance of recent KMP acquisitions."" After equity accounting and amortization, KMP contributed $60.5 million of pre-tax earnings to KMI in the second quarter, up from $28.3 million a year ago.  The Product Pipelines segment delivered a 57% increase in earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) of $101.8 million in the second quarter, compared to $65.0 million during the same period a year ago. The Natural Gas Pipelines segment produced segment earnings before DD&A of $39.6 million, a 24% increase, which reflected strong earnings growth from Red Cedar Gathering Company and the inclusion of additional gas assets that were transferred from KMI to KMP at the end of 2000. ""Adding Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline to this segment has made our gas pipeline business more seasonal, shifting more of the segment's income to the first and fourth quarters,"" Kinder explained. ""For this reason, the year-to-date increase of 56% in segment earnings before DD&A is more representative than a second quarter comparison.""  Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL), a KMI subsidiary, earned $80.3 million in the quarter, up from $80 million in the second quarter of 2000. NGPL benefited, said Kinder, from its ""successful recontracting of its long-haul transportation and storage capacity,"" adding that the subsidiary expects to add approximately 3,000-4000 MW of gas-fired capacity annually through 2004, ""which should boost demand.""  Power earnings surged, recording $18.8 million, compared with $8.6 million for the second quarter of 2000--a 119% jump, which the company attributed to growth in fee-income associated with gas-fired power plant development. Two 550 MW plants, expected to come online in the second quarter of 2002, are under construction in Little Rock, AR, and Jackson, MI. ""Both of those are on schedule and on budget,"" Kinder said.  Retail was the only segment that was down, but Kinder offered a positive spin on this as well. With earnings down $2.2 million from a year earlier, he noted that earnings in the second quarter of 2000 were boosted because of an earlier than normal, high-demand irrigation season. ""However, it's precisely that type of volatility that led us to initiate a weather hedging program in late 2000 to normalize our summer-irrigation and winter-heating load. With our hedging now in place, Retail earnings are up 6% year-to-date, and we remain confident that Retail will deliver approximately 10% growth in segment earnings this year.""  By itself, KMP, the largest pipeline master limited partnership in the United States, had a record quarter, with every business segment producing increased cash flow and earnings. ""Our results reflect both excellent internal growth and outstanding performance by recently acquired pipeline and terminal assets,"" said Kinder. KMP declared a second quarter distribution of $1.05 (an annualized rate of $4.20) per unit, that will be payable Aug. 14 to unitholders of record as of July 31. The distribution is 24% higher than the distribution of $0.85 per unit paid for the second quarter of 2000.The two for one stock split will be distributed on Aug. 31 to holders of record on Aug. 17.  This is the second time that KMP has split the units since its formation in February 1997, Kinder noted. ""Since then, KMP has turned over almost 600% to its unitholders."" KMP reported record quarterly net income of $104.2 million, or $0.72 per unit, versus $71.8 million, or $0.70 per unit, in the second quarter of 2000.

2022-04-21 06:06:58+00:00,true,4,"  Gale, here is the information that I have available about the subject interconnect.  The actual project is to install an additional tap and measuring facilities at the end of the lateral for peak deliveries of 12-15 MMcfd to ENA for power generating.  The problem is that the lateral capacity is about 25-27 MMcfd based upon turbine meter capacity for the Citizens Flagstaff point, but Citizens has about 25 MMcfd scheduled at their three points on the west end.  Their contract allows for them to take full obligations at either point (Kevin is checking on this); however, I don't believe that their flow regulation at the Flagstaff point (two-2"" regulators) can do more than 15 MMcfd (my intuitive guess, needs to be checked or verified).  Pressure - TW may be between 725-775 psig at peak TW mainline flows to Ca., Citizens pressure is reported to be around 365 psig downstream of control valves.     The greatest daily volume (MN 9213) since Jan 2000 was 11942 Mcf on Jan. 18, 2001 (as can be seen in the attached Excel worksheet extracted from MIPS meas. data).

2022-04-21 03:04:31+00:00,true,4,"   El Paso Moves Forward on California Expansion Projects  Encouraged by the results of recent market tests, El Paso Natural Gas announced two binding open seasons yesterday for 400-500 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity on a bi-directional lateral it plans to add to its system within California. It also plans to announce soon additional binding open seasons to expand its mainline.  The lateral, which El Paso obtained as part of its purchase of the All American oil pipeline in February 2000, runs from the area of Daggett, CA, southeast to the area of Blythe, CA, and Ehrenberg, AZ, on the Colorado River. The company intends to convert the line to transport gas between the two points, which are major spot market points for gas trading. The project will facilitate the movement of gas within California and provide service to power plants in California and Arizona. The open seasons close on July 10.  In its previous non-binding open season May 1-25, El Paso said it received requests for more than 2.1 Bcf/d on the Daggett-to-Ehrenberg path and more than 0.9 Bcf/d on the Ehrenberg-to-Daggett path. El Paso is offering to build capacity capable of transporting 500 MMcf/d on the Daggett-to-Ehrenberg path and 400 MMcf/d on the Ehrenberg-to-Daggett path. The receipt and delivery points are interchangeable for the two paths. In the Daggett area, receipt/delivery points include interconnects with Mojave Pipeline, Kern River, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Gas. In the Blythe and Ehrenberg area, the points include interconnects with the proposed North Baja Pipeline Project, Southern California Gas for incremental capacity within California, and El Paso's existing system near Ehrenberg for transportation upstream of California.  For both the Daggett-to-Ehrenberg path and the Ehrenberg-to-Daggett paths, El Paso is offering a reservation rate of no greater than 10 cents/Mcf on a 100% load factor basis. El Paso is estimating a fuel charge for both paths of 1.5%.  If the open seasons result in sufficient binding transportation agreements to make the lateral project economically viable, El Paso will file with FERC with a goal of placing the project in service during the first quarter of 2003.

2022-04-21 16:31:55+00:00,true,4,"  El Paso Holds Binding Open Season for Line 2000 Capacity  Following up on an earlier testing of the waters, El Paso Natural Gas announced Tuesday a binding open season for 320 MMcf/d of pipeline capacity from the Keystone and Waha areas of the Permian Basin in West Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, AZ. The binding open season began July 5 and closes on Aug. 2.  The project is part of the company's response to the interest expressed during El Paso's non-binding open season in March 2001 soliciting shippers for potential system expansions. It follows on an open season announced in late June for 400-500 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity on a bi-directional lateral it plans to add to its system within California. The lateral, which El Paso obtained as part of its purchase of the All American oil pipeline in February 2000, runs from the area of Daggett, CA, southeast to the area of Blythe, CA, and Ehrenberg, AZ, on the Colorado River. The company intends to convert the line to transport gas between the two points, which are major spot market points for gas trading (see Daily GPI, June 20 <d20010620g.html%20>). That open season ended Tuesday, but a spokesperson said it was too soon to publish results.  The expansion capacity from West Texas will be made available by adding compression to El Paso's Line 2000 from McCamey, TX to the California border near Ehrenberg. It will be sold at El Paso's existing maximum California tariff rate, with an estimated fuel charge of 5%. The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003, subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental and right-of-way authorizations.  The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Co.'s and Pacific Gas & Electric's proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso's bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg into California, and any upstream points on El Paso's South Mainline system where capacity exists.  ""This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands, including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States,"" said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas.  Interested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Jerry W. Strange at (719) 520-4687.

2022-04-21 03:41:28+00:00,true,5,"  Amy, I have elected to stay in Houston until at least February.  It is so late in the year,  that I may not be immediately effective in the West and I would have ""lost"" the first part of this year,  as I was training (myself). There is a huge need for me here and I am trying to do what's right for both E and myself.    To that end,   Lloyd Will has offered me an opportunity to trade around Enron's assets in Texas,   learning the term trading side of the business from Doug Gilbert-Smith. Both Doug and Lloyd know my circumstances and their proposal gets me the experience that I need,  while they get my experience in Services,  training & managing a team and making money in a pool type market, as exists in Texas.  These opportunities were presented to me only after I stated emphatically that I was returning to Portland.   I would still like to live in Portland as early as February.    I realize that a seat wont be held open for anyone,  and I will revisit this issue in Feb.  This compromise seems reasonable.   I have asked that this be committed to writing,  so I am editing what Lloyd has created concerning job responsibilities.  Additionally, most junior people are dissatisfied here and the bottom line reason:    they dont know how their job relates to the entire floor making money. This explanation to them and an acknowledement of their contribution will bring the ideas forth from the ""back corner."" The senior traders say aloud that they dont need anyone, and they will make their money with or without help.  A particular trader antagonizes until someone stands up to him,  then he has them sent home.     I think that there are three Real Timers at home at full pay right now.     One or two will be paid for two years, or so I'm told.   This type behavior is allowed as the trader makes a great amount of money for the company.   This is not an unusual occurence on trade floors,  but I will not be any part of it.  I am going to spend this time to try to make some difference in this culture.    If we dont get buy in from the top,  I will also be at risk of going home.    Some of these guys just dont get it.  There are, however,  many positives to staying here:  the guys I report to are like-minded concerning the above.   They are very competent and have a lot to teach & they are willing to teach.   I am excited about learning something new and also being able to lead a team.  Well,  thanks for listening to my sermon, sister Amy.   My wife and I miss Portland and will probably be back next year. Hopefully there will still be opportunity for me at that time.    If you have any thoughts or advice,  please share,  as I have alot of exposure this year, due to the move and subsequent reorg.

2022-04-21 08:51:17+00:00,true,5,"    This sheet is as complete as possible, and I am worried about it due to the following circumstances;  1.  The Dispatch sheet that comes to Real time was 25 MW flat on Sunday and LLH on Monday more than all the preschedules that were tagged today.  2.  The Four Corners values on that dispatch sheet changed between 5:15 and 5:42, from 10 mw long to flat. I tried to resolve the four corners schedules with PSCO, who   told me they did not have a purchase from EPE in July.  I tried calling numerous people at their office and cell phone numbers and got forwarded to Enron each time. Lisa had a buy resale with PNM at four corners, but that booked out and did not seem to match the 10 long that I saw in the dispatch sheet.  I spoke with Pete, who assured me that the sale to PSCO was good for the summer.    3.  I still was unable to resolve the 25 mw difference between the tags and schedules that we knew, and what the dispatch sheet said we should have for preschedule.  No EPE representative was available to tell me what they were expecting for the schedules, and I was referred by a Dispatch person to call on Saturday and speak to Carlos when he came in at 4 pm.  I was very uncomfortable doing this, and so in my desperation called Roger at home, who after some discussion with Steve at his home confirmed that the extrat 25 flat Sunday and LLH Monday was a deal that is supposed to begin on July 3.  I trust his assesment, and have removed the extra schedule from the sheet.    Between all of the preschedulers today at Enron, we have spent over 6 hours dealing with the EPE schedules today.    The sheet is as complete as I possibly can find justification for.  Cara Semperger West Power Scheduling 503/464-3814 ","3.

Our phone lines, computers and cell phones were down.    Additionally,   we were short staffed due to floodwaters downtown.  One of our service customers,  Teco,  wanted to sell some test power in South Texas.   Geir was contacted via satellite phone. He sold 230 megawatts each hour to AEP.   He used the proper terminology unique to Ercot and sold the energy at a decent price. He maintained good,  detailed notes and was able to relay this information to me the following Monday.

2022-04-21 03:50:43+00:00,true,5,"       BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  East Power Origination On Friday, June 15, the Development Review Committee for Deerfield Beach, Florida, unanimously approved the 510 megawatt peaking power plant proposed for their city.  This approval followed on the heels of approval of the Developer's Agreement by the Deerfield Beach City Commission on Thursday, June 14.  Enron Industrial Markets On Friday, June 8 Enron Industrial Markets closed transactions with Huntco Inc. under which EIM will provide inventory management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel. The EIM project team developed a creative, 15-year structure that enhances Huntco's liquidity, reduces working capital requirements, and hedges their inventory position against directional price risk.    In addition, EIM structured the acquisition of Huntco's cold mill and certain coil pickling operations.  A special purpose vehicle funded by third party equity now owns the assets, which continue to be operated by Huntco under an O&M agreement.  As part of the transaction, EIM purchased a 20-year call option on capacity at the cold mill located in Blytheville, Arkansas.    These transactions with Huntco signal a fundamental change in the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  They give Enron immediate access to physical steel and position Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways. Consummation of the Huntco transactions would not have been possible without the contributions of multiple Enron groups who enhanced value to Enron while significantly mitigating risk.   IN THE NEWS  ""Mario Max Yzaguirre, a former Enron executive, was appointed Wednesday by Gov. Rick Perry to the state agency that is overseeing electricity deregulation in Texas.

In fact, temperatures wil actually average below normal for  Monday-Wednesday before warming at the end of the week. Although there is some  possibility of above to much above normal temperatures in California and the  Desert Southwest, it seems more likely that at least a partial start to the  monsoon thunderstorms will occur. Since the normal high is 104 in Phoenix, I  would opt for 1-2 degrees above normal as an average for the week.    The Pacific Northwest will see below normal  temperatures for the next 10-14 days on average.  Above normal precipitation for the time of  year...

Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.  Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact.  Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES.  ENA SIC Codes:  Primary Metals Mining and Extraction Oil and Gas Extraction Paper and Forest Products Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers Refining Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing Fertilizer Rail Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler Cement Aerospace - restricted to Boeing, Raytheon, GE Aircraft, Allied Signal, Hamilton-Sundstrom Large Agricultural Processing ","ENA Members From: John Lavorato & Dave Delainey.

This is a random event as calls get routed to cards based on availability.  If this happens, the party would have to call back and try again, or get a hold of your admin to leave a written message.   THE FIX:  PGE will have cards here in the morning and will replace them on Saturday.  They are waiting to do this because it will require a system wide outage of voicemail.  The repair is currently scheduled for this Saturday, 10:00 PST and should last no more than 2 hours.   Please let me know if you have any questions.

I have to go shopping tomorrow for a bridal shower gift for Reagan Parsons. She's getting married next month in Hawaii. Iris is living in St. Louis but I haven't seen her in several months. Her sons introduced her to a nice guy I've been told and they are hitting it off.  We had some exciting local news today! The New Baden branch bank of First Federal was robbed this a.m. by 3 armed men wearing costumes. No one was hurt but one guy is still on the loose. Two vehicles led about 20 police cars on a 110 mile an hour chase on 64 to a residential neighborhood in East St. Louis. The story was on all 4 St. Louis stations today. Hopefully, they'll have more details at 10.  I'm working on salary negotiations for our union. Actually, it is for all the educational support personnel as we are referred to now. I'm meeting with my committe Thurs. to inform them what the Board has countered with. The salary will be the sticky issue as usual. I hope we won't be working on it all summer.  Sandy and I had a great time as usual! I was worn out from laughing! We had fun at our class reunion despite the lame attendance of our class--22 members (excluding spouses) out of 94. We stopped by Grandma and Grandpa's a couple of times. Sandy and I also went to Galena one day.  Tigger and Sweet Pea say ""hi"".  O.K.  I lied--they're sleeping! What a surprise!

2022-04-21 06:10:45+00:00,false,5,"  Hotwanger,  Unemployment is not something to be taken lightly. With the right approach, it can be a richly  fulfilling experience. The wrong approach can leave you unsatisfied and disenchanted. Or dissatisfied and unenchanted. Whatever. There is a bit of a science involved. A few tips:  If you are living with someone...which you are...it is important that she not wake you up when she is on her way to work, as you likely have nowhere to go at that hour anyway.  Tell her to blow dry her hair in the car or don't bother. If she wants you to do something to help her out, like make breakfast, pour a bowl of cereal the night before and put it in the fridge. If she gets bored with that, put it in the freezer for an icy treat.  Waking up mid-afternoon may make it difficult for you to get to sleep at a decent hour, and your sleep cycle may become so offset that you are actually never awake when  Tara is. That will likely become a sticking point. Drinking during the afternoon will put you in a drowsy state of mind come nightfall, and you can ensure a regular 14 hrs of slumber.  There are things to do in a new city, but they are overrated. TV can and will provide whatever culture you think you need. Go outside only for beer or fast food.   At some point, there may be pressure on you to ""look for a job."" That is an overly vague request. You are likely developing and formulating a career direction with your time  off, and a job would take away from this ""me"" time and set you back months.  I took a run at unemployment last year, but with the added wrinkle of no TV. That is a challenge I wouldn't recommend on your first attempt. Removing you from even a premium cable package would be akin to taking a polio sufferer out of an iron lung.  Malt liquor + taco bell Frito burrito = projectile diarrhea.  That's it for now. I have to get to a meeting. Give me some feedback on how things shake out. In the coming days, I will send out a supplement newsletter on the benefits of  substitute teaching.

2022-04-21 19:39:48+00:00,true,6,"  forestweb.com ALPHARETTA, Ga., July 16, 2001 (press release) -- Schweitzer-Mauduit Intern= ational, Inc. (NYSE: SWM - news) today announced a plan to restructure its = Brazilian operations and exit the printing and writing uncoated papers busi= ness in Brazil in response to current business conditions. A pre-tax charge=  of approximately $4.5 to $5.0 million will be taken in the second quarter = of 2001 to implement this restructuring. Excluding this unusual item, the C= ompany anticipates diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 200= 1 to be in the range of $.52 to $.54 per share. Second quarter diluted earn= ings per share in 2000 were $.41.=20 Brazilian Restructuring=20 Wayne H. Deitrich, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, comme= nted that, ``Recent changes in Brazilian business conditions made it necess= ary for Schweitzer-Mauduit to reassess its ability to continue to compete e= ffectively in the printing and writing uncoated papers market. Sales volume= s during the past six months have been unfavorably impacted by a slowdown i= n the Brazilian printing and writing papers market as well as by a decision=  by the Company to reduce its sales of certain grades of these papers that = have been negatively impacted by ICMS, a form of value-added business tax. = In addition, the recently enacted electricity rationing program in Brazil h= as necessitated production curtailments in our Brazilian operations. The pr= inting and writing uncoated papers business is our least profitable product=  line in Brazil while being our largest electricity user.''=20 The decision to exit the printing and writing uncoated papers business in B= razil will result in a pre-tax charge in the second quarter of 2001 of appr= oximately $4.5 to $5.0 million, or $.20 to $.22 per share, for a non-cash w= rite-off of assets. In addition, a further pre-tax charge of approximately = $0.5 to $0.7 million, or $.02 to $.03 per share, will be taken in the third=  quarter, primarily related to employee termination and severance costs. Sc= hweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil's net sales of printing and writing uncoated pap= ers totaled approximately $25 million in 2000. Because of cost reduction st= eps to be implemented as part of the restructuring, exiting the printing an= d writing uncoated papers business is not expected to have a material impac= t on ongoing operating results after the restructuring is fully implemented= , which should occur by year-end 2001.=20 Brazilian Energy Situation=20 In late May, the Brazilian government announced the details of its electric= ity rationing program which has an overall objective of a 20 percent reduct= ion in electricity consumption and mandates a 25 percent reduction in elect= ricity consumption by the paper industry in the most populated and industri= alized regions of Brazil. The reduction is calculated from prior-year avera= ge electricity consumption. The reduction must be measured and achieved for=  consecutive thirty-day periods commencing May 31, 2001. Failure to achieve=  the mandated reductions would result in higher electricity rates and cuts = in electrical power service. The duration of the government's energy reduct= ion directive is uncertain although it is expected to last at least six mon= ths, through the traditional ``dry period'' in Brazil. The government's for= ced consumption reduction program is in response to unusually low water lev= els in the lakes and reservoirs supplying Brazil's hydroelectric facilities=  that provide 90 percent of that country's electricity.=20 In response to the Brazilian government's energy reduction directive, Schwe= itzer-Mauduit do Brasil implemented a four-part electricity reduction progr= am. All nonessential nonmanufacturing uses of electricity are being elimina= ted including cuts in air conditioning, reduced lighting and changes in the=  operation of the water and effluent treatment plants. Manufacturing proces= s modifications are being implemented to achieve more energy-efficient usag= e of equipment where product quality will not be compromised. A comprehensi= ve energy conservation training program is being conducted for Brazilian em= ployees and contracted service providers of the Company to increase awarene= ss and solicit ideas for additional electricity reduction. To achieve the 2= 5 percent electrical consumption reduction target, it has also been necessa= ry to implement production curtailments. Machine downtime has been taken to=  reduce the production of the Company's least profitable products.=20 Mr. Deitrich added that, ``Schweitzer-Mauduit does not expect the governmen= t's electricity reduction program to significantly affect the demand for or=  its ability to produce tobacco-related papers. Likewise, the availability = of the Company's major raw materials such as wood pulp, chemicals and chalk=  and the ability to receive raw materials and ship finished product are not=  expected to be materially impacted. Exiting the printing and writing uncoa= ted papers business will permit Schweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil to better focu= s on and service its other product lines.''=20 Anticipated Second Quarter Results=20 Excluding the unusual charge associated with restructuring the Brazilian op= erations, the Company anticipates diluted earnings per share for the second=  quarter of 2001 to be in the range of $.52 to $.54 per share. Operating pr= ofit improvement is anticipated in both the French and U.S. business units = compared with the prior-year quarter. Results for the quarter are expected = to benefit from increased tobacco-related papers sales volumes, lower wood = pulp costs and improvement in average selling prices. The average per ton l= ist price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp in the United States was=  $570 per metric ton in the second quarter of 2001 compared with $680 per m= etric ton in the second quarter of 2000. These positive factors will be par= tially offset by higher purchased energy costs and expenses related to the = banded cigarette paper project and resultant higher cost of operations at t= he Spotswood, New Jersey mill.=20 Schweitzer-Mauduit will issue its second quarter 2001 earnings press releas= e on Thursday, July 26, 2001. The Company will hold a conference call to re= view second quarter results with investors and analysts at 10:30 a.m. easte= rn time on that day.

2022-04-21 22:01:56+00:00,true,6,"  paperloop.com SAN FRANCISCO, July 19, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Tembec Inc., the second-largest capacity pulp producer in North America, plans to shut down its mills for the month of August due to weak market conditions, said a company executive. Earlier, Tembec had announced it would curtail pulp production by about 100,000 tonnes in the third quarter. ""All of it (is market-related downtime), most is in August,"" said the executive, who indicated the firm would ?shut down cold' most of its facilities systemwide for the month. ""My customers are taking downtime and I in turn told them we will match their downtime. Our October 1 inventory will be the same as in '99 when the market was tight."" Last week, an industry source noted that Tembec would take a month of downtime at its 227,000 tonne/yr northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) mill in Skookumchuck, B.C. With the closure in August, that mill will lose about 20,119 tonnes while Tembec's other NBSK mill, in Smooth Rock Falls, Ont., will trim about 16,926 tonnes based on capacity of 191,000 tonnes/yr. Tembec's NBSK downtime will total 37,405 tonnes, representing more than a third of its 3Q downtime.  Tembec's third-quarter curtailments equal the firm's combined downtime on the year, with 55,000 tonnes trimmed from supplies in 2Q. But the executive said this quarter there were no plans to perform maintenance.  ""We have no traction in prices because the inventories (industrywide) are too high. Shutting down now is not going to cost us in sales. We have stock. Given that paper business returns to normal I will be able to run my business normal.""

The shutter, which began June 23, is slated to end Friday, said a company source. ""We had projected around a month of downtime,"" said the source, who indicated that Samoa Pacific's downtime would still total about 17,700 tonnes for the third quarter. Based on the mill's capacity, it will have lost about 15,500 tonnes during the 27-day shutter.  ""We would hope not to go down again for the year. Four weeks (of market related downtime) was projected but we didn't know if it would slide another week or not.""  The Samoa mill produces 100 percent chlorine-free processed (TCF) bleached and unbleached softwood and hardwood kraft pulps. The official noted that the mill will ""do as much bleached pulp as we can sell"" as it moves to supply more specialized pulps and less commodity tonnage, which has taken the largest hit in prices both in the U.S. and Asia. Roughly 50 percent of the mill's output is sold to Asian markets. ""We've been looking for better markets and developing new customers and maintaining our current ones,"" said the source.

2022-04-21 13:30:12+00:00,true,6,"  Kevin:  My lack of response this week has not been because I have not been thinking about a possible structure.  It is because the new FERC cap is making it difficult to figure out how a project like this is going to operate.  A few thoughts:  I.  CDWR Dispatch Issues:  It remains unclear to me how the communication with GWF/CDWR will work each day.  What time will we get an indication of the volume they want?  If the communication occurs late, it will be difficult to obtain much value from the capacity they do not need.  Even if the communication occurs late, with the current cap there is little value in the ""extra"" MWs at your heat rate, given the current FERC cap and gas prices.  Given that there could be very little value on the ""extra"" MWs, we would ask for a monthly fee in the neighborhood of $10,000 to schedule the CDWR volumes.  To fine tune this number we need to clarify a few things.  Will we be invoicing CDWR?  What is the scheduling timing?  What is the Enron liability for failure to submit the schedule?  Do you want us to submit supplemental bids for your ""extra"" capacity on your behalf to abide by the FERC order?  What happens if you are dispatched at a loss when we forget to put in Supplemental Energy Bids.  2.  Gas Pricing:  Here is a summary of possible gas pricing for you.  1.  GWF pays demand charge equal to Maximum Daily Quantity (MDQ) times $.05/MMBtu. 2.  GWF schedules gas each day with the Enron up to the MDQ.  The Daily Contract Quantity (DCQ) is the amount GWF schedules each day. 3. Quantities above the DCQ can be made available on a mutually acceptable basis. 4.   GWF pays variable charge equal to DCQ times Gas Daily Mid-Point for PG&E City gate, plus $.05/MMBtu.   5. GWF can substititue for the Gas Daily price with a NGI PG&E City Gate Price or a Fixed Price upon mutual agreement.. 6. GWF responsible for any imbalance charges resulting from using a volume different than the DCQ. 7. Enron responsible for imbalance charges when they deliver a quantity other than the DCQ. 8. The Monthly Consumption Quantity (MCQ) is the sum of daily usage. 9. If GWF does not want to be in the Enron Enron Contracted marketer Pool, GWF will be responsible for managing imbalances between the DCQ and actual  usage. 10. If GWF wants to be in the Enron Enron Contracted marketer Pool, differences between the MCQ and the sum of the DCQs shall be cashed out as follows  provided Imbalance Charges are not incurred. EPMI will purchase the volume by which the sum of the DCQs exceeds the MCQ at the average of the 5  highest days Gas Daily Mid-Point and sell the volume by which the sum of the DCQs is less than the MCQ at the average of the 5 lowest days Gas Daily Mid- Point. If Imbalance Charges are incurred then either 6 or 7 would apply.     In conclusion, I recognize that you might think $10k/Month is steep.  However, Scheduling Coordination is labor intensive and risky, particularly with the FERC cap and the political quagmire.  That said, I definitely think we can help you guys optimize your generation, but .  At a minimum we can buy your energy from time to time.  We can also set you up with Enron Online for no cost, providing the most transparent price information available in the industry today.  For these reasons, I want to get Master Agreements in place.  The first step in this process is for you to provide financial statements.  Can you send those to me?  Something that might work for you guys is to use the APX to be your SC.  This will require more work  on your part, but it is a low cost option.  Another thing is to watch out for firms offering low prices for SC services without giving you a clear indication of what they will pay you for your ""extra"" MWs.  They will  make their $ somewhere.Do not limit yourself to one counterparty.  IN this age you need multiple trading partners to optimize your generation.  I will call to discuss.

2022-04-21 19:48:56+00:00,true,6,"  paperloop.com In U.S. East spot markets, northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) pulp prices declined just over a percent while hardwood spot transactions took a larger fall since July 2. Traders said that although some suppliers had pulled out of spot business, availability of various grades was still plentiful. Prices for spot NBSK delivered in the Northeast or Midwest dipped $5/tonne to $420-$450/tonne, or 13 percent below July contract prices, paperloop sources said. Southern bleached softwood kraft (SBSK) on the spot market also fell, down $5/tonne to $400-$430/tonne. ""Prices are still eroding in the States (because) a lot of spot is still available, it's all over the place,"" said a supplier source. But he added that spot prices had eroded so badly in Asian markets that he pulled out altogether. Previously, some suppliers had diverted tonnage to Asian markets because of stronger demand for hardwoods there. Both hardwood grades fell in the U.S. by $10/tonne on oversupply as producers tried to edge down their inventories. Northern bleached hardwood kraft (NBHK) closed the week about 18 percent below July contract prices at $340-380/tonne. Southern bleached hardwood kraft (SBHK) also ended at $340-380/tonne, but the lower end prices were partly keyed by low freight costs.

2022-04-21 20:54:22+00:00,true,6,"  paperloop.com SAN FRANCISCO, July 18, 2001 (paperloop.com) - North American market pulp prices tumbled for the seventh time in as many months on seasonal weak demand and continued papermaker downtime. Benchmark northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) declined 7.4 percent or $40/tonne to $500/tonne, while other pulp grades fell less.  Some producers indicated they ""have no list"" prices anymore as deals have increasingly occurred on a case-by-case basis, while one major producer said it had abandoned its list two months ago and has simply discounted.  The sustained drop in prices prompted both sellers and buyers to note last week that even suppliers holding low inventories aren't able to leverage themselves in pricing. A large-volume buyer source said that his firm's discounts ""are anywhere from 5 percent to double digits,"" even off the latest prices. Many producers continued offloading pulp to markets such as China, South Korea and Taiwan as prices there appear to have leveled off at low levels. Market watchers last week expressed concern with global inventories and the wholesale exports to non-Japan Asian markets. ""I'm concerned with what will happen (to inventories) through July and August,"" said a Canadian industry consultant, who said that although pricing dynamics could improve after September, producers may fight inventory surges all year. ""I hope they don't overproduce. This cycle is harsher than most cycles because of paper downtime."" Salomon Smith Barney analyst Chip Dillon noted in a report that the latest inventories are, ""well above the 1.5 million tonne 'inflection' level...total inventories combined typically rise over 230,000 tonnes during July and August (so) we believe pulp prices will remain under pressure."" Various North American producers have declined selling pulp to Asian markets on below cash-cost prices, but buyers there continue to bargain hunt from second or third suppliers. Because of lower operating costs and the availability of cheap NBSK, a buyer source said that his firm's paper machines are profitably running at 100 percent through the summer season. ""Some suppliers have more inventory than others and have no choice but to sell,"" noted the buyer. Meanwhile, several pulp producers have attempted to offset poor demand conditions by further curtailing production. Tembec Inc. said it would slash its pulp output by at least 100,000 tonnes during the third quarter, matching the downtime it had taken through the first two quarters combined. Although Tembec didn't announce which mills or grades of pulp would be affected, an industry source said that Tembec was taking a month of downtime at its Crestbrook mill in Skookumchuck, B.C. With capacity to produce 227,000 tonnes/yr of NBSK, the mill's downtime would represent about 19,440 tonnes. Weyerhaeuser recently told customers it would take about 54,000 tonnes of primarily NBSK market-related downtime during the third quarter. A Weyerhaeuser official said its mill in Prince Albert, Sask., would trim about 14,000 tonnes of NBSK and NBHK; 24,000 tonnes of NBSK would be cut at its mill in Grand Prairie, Alta., at a time to be determined later; and its Kamloops, B.C., mill would cut 16,500 tonnes of NBSK during outages in August and September.  Additionally, the official expected that incremental tonnage would be lost during some maintenance downtime during the quarter. The downtime at Weyerhaeuser ""reflects softness in fine paper demand,"" said the official. ""Demand to Europe is particularly soft and with the strong dollar we have currency issues."" Other producers are reducing supplies without acknowledging their curtailments. Producer sources in British Columbia said that Celgar Pulp Co. in Castlegar, B.C., would shut down production for about 35 days due to market reasons. With capacity to produce about 425,000 tonnes/yr of NBSK, the outage could clip about 42,490 tonnes from supplies. A source at Western Pulp Ltd. said the Vancouver, B.C., firm had extended the shutdown its 255,000 tonne/yr NBSK pulp mill in Squamish due to continued soft demand. The downtime, which began on June 1, is expected to total six weeks, said the source. Western Pulp's Squamish operation will likely cut at least 30,000 tonnes from supplies during the closure, said the source. In Wisconsin, an NBHK mill is currently shut down for market reasons and a company source said it would chop about 20,000 tonnes from production before restarting later this month.  ""In the fourth quarter, these kraft mills can't shut down,"" said the source. ""You have to run during the winter, but right now you can take a mill down. If the downtime isn't taken now, you will see a real bloodletting in the fourth quarter.""","paperloop.com SAN FRANCISCO, July 18, 2001 (paperloop.com) - North American market pulp prices tumbled for the seventh time in as many months on seasonal weak demand and continued papermaker downtime.

(IP) took 80,000 tonnes of market pulp downtime in the second quarter and is likely to take the same amount in both the third and fourth quarters, the company said today.  IP executive vice president and chief financial officer John Faraci made the comments in the company's conference call today, in connection with the release of second quarter results showing a $313 million net loss.  An IP spokesman said there were no further details.  The second-half plan would be about the same rate of market downtime the company has taken since the beginning of the year.  Last month an informed source said that from January through April, the company had taken 130,000 tonnes of total pulp downtime, including 25,000 tonnes for maintenance.  That would average 26,250 tonnes per month of market-related downtime for the first four months of the year, about the same as the 26,700 tonnes per month average for 80,000 tonnes per quarter.  ""IP is doing what it needs to do, with prices what they are,"" said a Canadian pulp and paper industry consultant who heard the conference call.

2022-04-21 17:51:14+00:00,true,6,"  paperloop.com HELSINKI, July 13, 2001 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said on Friday that it saw pulp prices bottoming out at $460 per tonne in the third quarter -- six percent below current levels -- and lowered its pulp forecasts through the end of 2003. The investment bank said that $460 was the cash cost of producing for the highest-cost producers, so it should represent the very bottom of pricing in the current cycle. But MSDW said in its morning preview note that it was not lowering its earnings forecasts for the major European paper producers as the integrated manufacturers have little or no exposure to prices of market pulp. The major European producers include the world's second biggest papermaker Stora Enso and third biggest UPM-Kymmene, Finnish M-real, Norwegian Norske Skog and the European operations of South African Sappi. ""It would take lower paper price forecasts for us to reduce our earnings estimates,"" MSDW said. ""So far, aggressive producer downtime has kept paper prices from collapsing, however, we do expect second-quarter results to be down from the first quarter and the risks to our estimates for the full-year 2001 remain to the downside."" Prices of long-fibre pulp have dropped 31 percent this year, to current levels around $491 per tonne as the global economy has cooled and manufacturers of fine paper have sharply curbed output to take up slack in global demand. But paper prices, which usually follow pulp prices, have held up better than in previous downturns. The European papermakers' second-quarter earnings reporting season will start with Stora Enso's report on July 26.","paperloop.com HELSINKI, July 13, 2001 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said on Friday that it saw pulp prices bottoming out at $460 per tonne in the third quarter -- six percent below current levels -- and lowered its pulp forecasts through the end"
