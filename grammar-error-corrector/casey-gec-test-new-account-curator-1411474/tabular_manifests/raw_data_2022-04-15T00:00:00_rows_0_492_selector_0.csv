These quotes are indicitive  based on todays curves.  Let me know if we need to firm up these numbers  tomorrow.  I do have some questions/concerns relating to this deal before  this can be done however, they are:    1)  Should the volume be a baseload volume of 10,000/day?   2)  How are you buying your coal for the plant (i.e. fixed, index...)?   3)  What is the correlation of the SRAC and the Socal Border price  (especially during this time of high volatility)?   4)  Has there been a calculation of the change in Socal Border vs. the  change in the SRAC to calculate the proper volume to hedge (basically a    delta calculation)?  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  My phone number is  (713) 853-6247.  Thanks.  John   ","Mike and Frank, Attached are the quotes for options based on your previous email.

2022-04-15 21:32:48+00:00,true,1,"  1)  Is this deal done?  No, not yet.  Cabot is reviewing our new Enfolio long  term contract and has suggested some minor modifications.  Also, this new  long term contract form is awaiting final Legal Department approval - we  expect this imminently.  Finally, our reservoir engineers are scheduled to  visit Cabot's offices on 12/5/2000 to review their downhole data - we will  not enter into a long term contract until a full reserve review has been  completed.   2)  What is the firm quantity?   The quantitiy should be fixed.  For  December, the firm quantity on Tennessee is 11,280 Mmbtu/d, or 80% of the  14,100 Mmbtu/d we expect to flow.  The firm quantity on Transco is 14,720  Mmbtu/d, or 80% of the 18,400 Mmbtu/d we expect to flow.  We intend to keep  the desk whole on these firm quantities. 3)  Who is communcating with Cabot from a logisitics/volume management point  of view?  We expect to communicate with Cabot from a logistics/volume  management point of view.  4)  Why are we nominating ( instead of ENA Upstream) and which group is  responsible for balancing on Tenn and Transco?  We intend to do whatever is  necessary to get the gas to pipeline pooling points and thereupon turn it  over to each Desk's logistics team.  We do not see the need to duplicate our  existing logistics function.

Zone 1    Victor,  Are you guys nominating/confirming this gas on Tennessee Passkey and Transco  Transit for December or are we?  We expect that as the deals are entered into  Sitara, you will be asked to nominate and confirm this gas.  Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm  volume and one for the swing)?  We'll need those deal numbers when you have  them..  Actually, we've prepared 3 deal tickets for each deal.  One ticket is  for the 80% firm purchase (first of the month index pricing) from Cabot by  Upstream, the second ticket is for the 20% spot purchase (gas daily pricing)  from Cabot by Upstream and the third ticket is the desk-to-desk transaction  in which Upstream sells the 80% firm volume to the East Desk - this is the  ticket which will generate origination to the Upstream Desk, if applicable.     Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we?  You are.   George x3-6992        Enron North America Corp.

Once you and John have had an opportunity to review  these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through  the system.  Thanks.  Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of  their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their  volume.  We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing  for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005  for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and  submitted upon execution of the long term paper.  If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all  future deals in a similar manner.  George x3-6992     ","1) Is this deal done? No, not yet.

2022-04-15 21:47:02+00:00,true,1,"  We are approaching the final countdown as to signing our definitive agreement  with El Paso regarding the sale of JEDI II's 51% interest in East Coast Power  and ENA's $157.9mm of ECP Subordinated Notes.    The transaction has continued to develop along the lines of my last update of  11-21-00.  The terms and economics remain essentially as outlined on  11-21-00.  In summary, the primary form of consideration will be a  derivative-like commodity agreement or a 'contract for differences'.  This  contract will be exchanged in full for the SubNotes and the majority of our  equity interest.  The JEDI II equity interest will also receive a residual  contingent interest which will become payable in the event of a PPA  restructuring at the Linden facility.  We are calling the derivative a swap  but it is more like a receivable.  An El Paso affiliate (guaranteed by El  Paso as parent) will notionally be paying NYMEX plus approx $0.52  (escalating) over seven years on a notional volume of 300,000 MMBtu/d and  receiving NYMEX.  With netting the contract is simply a series of fixed  quarterly payments over seven years.  No offset rights and no limitations on  the guarantee - fully a stand alone agreement.    We are optimistic that we may be able to sign documents as early as Thursday  night.  This agreement can be terminated at our option in the event that we  do not receive the necessary internal approvals.  There are only two  significant external approvals required, a NJ Environmental  'non-applicability' determination and ECP credit ratings reaffirmation.   Accordingly we expect at this time to receive the necessary internal and  external approvals and close by year end.  We expect that a public  announcement would be appropriate at the time both parties have received all  necessary internal approvals.  The portion of the commodity contract being exchanged for the SubNotes is  expected to be offered to Condor to monetize this portion of the contract at  year end.  Subsequent to Condor's acquisition of its contract, both JEDI II's  contract and the Condor contract are expected to be monetized in a QSPE  vehicle later in the first quarter.    Please call or email with any questions you may have.  Thanks for your  assistance in these matters.",We are approaching the final countdown as to signing our definitive agreement with El Paso regarding the sale of JEDI II's 51% interest in East Coast Power and ENA's $157.9mm of ECP Subordinated Notes.

Assessment                                           ? ?The National Energy Board has released its  latest in a series of Energy  Market Assessment? reports  entitled Canadian Natural Gas Market Dynamics and  Pricing. The  report identifies the factors that affect natural gas prices  and  describes the current functioning of the regional gas markets in   Canada. The Board's report concludes that Canada has become part of  an  integrated North American natural gas market. Natural gas can be  bought from  many supply sources and delivered to any market centre  through an extensive  North American pipeline grid. With the  increased integration of the markets,  regional supply and demand  forces are felt throughout the marketplace. It  also says that a  combination of strong economic growth in North America, a  preference  for natural gas fired electricity generation, and low natural  gas  prices led to sustained growth in demand throughout the 1990s.  However,  the growth in natural gas supply has lagged during the last  few                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    years. This is primarily attributable to the low oil price  environment of  1997/1998 which reduced cash flow for the producing  sector. In turn,  drilling activity decreased throughout North  America. Since demand growth  has outpaced supply growth, natural gas  prices have increased significantly  over the last year. With oil  prices recovering sharply in 1999/2000, the  producing sector has  responded and drilling activity is at high levels.  Despite the  drilling activity, there is a lag between developing additional  gas  supplies and connecting those supplies to the market. In time, there   will be a supply and demand response and accompanying relief in  natural gas  prices is expected. A period of market adjustment is  necessary any time the  dynamic between supply, transportation and  demand is significantly changed.  It is difficult, if not impossible,  to predict with certainty any movements  in the commodity markets.

After a week  of preliminary talks that failed to resolve differences over  how  best to protect the planet, government leaders have arrived to  bargain  over the toughest aspects of curbing emissions. About 2,000  lower level  officials did what they could to prepare for the final  week of negotiations  among environment ministers or cabinet-rank  officers from at least 150  countries. The US feels its effort to  find common ground and be flexible has  not been returned by?  European counterparts. The US has been singled out for  criticism for  its effort to reduce its commitments. The government  essentially  agreed to Kyoto because they agreed to the flexibility  mechanisms  such as emissions trading, now the US is running into trouble  with  that. If the conference ends in agreement, any treaty enforcing a  new  global code of behavior on emissions will require ratification  by most of  the industrial countries. Without a US endorsement, it  would be difficult  for such a treaty to come into force. The US  Senate already has passed a  resolution making its ratification  conditional on assurances that the  nation's competitiveness on world  markets will not be harmed. A select group  of leading policy makers  held informal closed-door talks in The Hague ahead  of a ceremony  Monday marking the start of the critical second phase of the   conference. The politicians are working toward a comprehensive plan  to  reduce the Earth's output of heat-trapping gasses from  businesses, farms and  automobiles, without bloating national budgets  or hampering the global  economy. A board of 2,000 leading  scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change, projects  that in the coming 100 years there will be more  rainfall, a  temperature increase of up to 11 degrees Fahrenheit and a  sea-level  rise of up to 30 inches. An agreement reached in 1997 in Kyoto,   Japan, called for a worldwide reduction of carbon-based gas  emissions by an  average 5.2% below 1990 levels. The target date for  the reductions was 2012.  Europe is committed to cutting emissions  8%, Japan 6% and the US 7%.

However, FERC has  never  articulated clearly a requirement that a party exercising a   contractual termination right must demonstrate that termination is   consistent with the public interest, according to Dynegy. It also  argued  that it has not refused to participate in an RTO; it merely  seeks to join  one that adequately protects its legitimate financial  interests and also  represents a significant improvement to the  status quo for other market  participants. Dynegy urged FERC to limit  its decision on whether or not the  company can leave the ISO to the  facts, not on the uproar Dynegy's actions  have caused in the  Midwest.

2022-04-15 21:40:34+00:00,true,1,"  Mike and Frank,  Attached is a revised quote for options relating to the ACE deal.  The  changes include actual Daily MW Production from Gray and also a hedge ratio  of 10.522 mmbtu's/MW.  I calculated the hedge ratio 2 ways.  First I put the  SRAC formula in excel (tying to the Aug'00 SRAC calculation from SoCal  Edison) and I increased the price of natural gas by $1 and noted the  difference in the SRAC power price.  That resulted in an increase in the SRAC  of $1.0522 cents/kwh or converted to $10.522/mwh.  I also looked at a change  in mark-to-market profit based on a hedge of 10.522 mmbtu's for every 1 MW.   So for every 1 mwh you need to hedge 10.522 mmbtu's.  Next I took the SRAC  formula below:       Pn = {PBase + (PBase * (GPn - GPBase)/GPBase * Factor)} * TOU      Where   Pn = SRAC price      PBase = Base Enery Price $2.0808 cents/kwh (constant)      GPn = current Socal index      GPBase = Base Gas Price $1.3975/mmbtu (constant)      Factor = % change in enery price affected by gas price .7067 (constant)      TOU = time of use (i.e. Summer on peak = 1.4251)  If you look at just the piece that moves (GPn) and calculate a $1  increase:    ($2.0808 * ($1 - $1.375)/$1.375 * .7067) = 1.0522.   Gray had calculated the heat rate by taking the SRAC price divided by the gas  price.  This heat rate moves depending on the level of gas (decreases with an  increase in gas price).  This is a correct  calculation for the heat rate,  however, to calculate the hedge delta, the above calculation should be used  and this hedge delta stays constant no matter the level of gas price.  Please call with any questions or concerns.  My number is (713) 853-6247.   Thanks.  John   ","Mike and Frank, Attached are a revised quote for options relating to the ACE deal.

TotalFinaElf plans to construct a natural gas  gathering project with its  north American partners in the Gulf of  Mexico, enabling the development of  three deep offshore natural gas  fields. The project consisted of a 56-mile  pipeline with a  transmission capacity of 500 MMcf per day and a processing  platform,  owned and operated by Williams.? Construction of the Canyon   Express pipeline, in the Mississippi Canyon area about 120 miles  southeast  of New Orleans, will begin next year. The gathering system  will begin  operating in summer 2002, at the same time as the three  natural gas fields,  Aconcagua, King's Peak and Camden Hills. Canyon  Express was a major  technological breakthrough for TotalFinaElf,  making it possible to undertake  oil and natural gas operations at  previously untapped depths of over 6,000  feet. The gas gathering  system will be operated by Elf Exploration and  belong to the  companies who owned the Aconcagua, King's Peak and Camden  Hills  fields. Aconcagua is operated by Elf Exploration which has a 50%   stake in the field. Enron affiliate, Mariner Energy, and Pioneer  Natural  Resources each own 25%. King's Peak is wholly-owned and  operated by BP  Amoco. Camden Hills is operated by Marathon, with a  50% stake. Total  Exploration Production USA owns 16.67% and Pioneer  owns 33.3%. Aconcagua  will own 45%; King's Peak, 35%; and Camden  Hills 20% of the Canyon Express  pipeline.

It was my job to resolve all imbalance  discrepancies on LRP, and then give my findings to commercial.  As I was  working with Sherryl Cranford at Stingray, she made it clear that they were  anxious to get the imbalances resolved and settled as well, and that was the  only imbalance we discussed.  I think Sherryl and I agreed to that imbalance  sometime in september.  Whether or not they've been asking for the gas back  since February, I don't know because I didn't deal with LRP companies until  several months later.

Mr. Tanenbaum stated he  finds no problem with the plan to achieve this status. He indicated that his  review of the programs should stand for the evaluation of the program  elements, and agreed that the OSHA 200 Log review would cover the remainder  of the evaluation requirement, but suggested this be done under Attorney  Client privilege with him.

2022-04-15 21:05:35+00:00,true,2,"  Hello , my name is Tori Kuykendall (One Pass BJ927934).  My husband, Patrick(  One Pass VF751282), and I have been One Pass members for a few years now as  well as elite members on several occasions.  We also use Chase Continental  Visa exclusively, and my husband is a President's Club member.  I have made  Continental my airline of choice for as long as I can remember booking my own  travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past.   This morning, however, I had a very bad experience.  I booked tickets for a  vacation back on September 4th for a trip from Houston to New York on  December 1.  Since I booked the ticket, I became pregnant and found out from  my doctor last week that I will still be unable to travel on December 1st due  to complications with my pregnancy.  My doctor indicated to me that I may not  be able to fly at all during my pregnancy, which is due to end in June.  I  spoke to Leroy Peterson this morning to explain the situation, and he  indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on  September 5th, 2001 and that a $75 service would be charged to me next time I  book a ticket for me or my husband.  I understand that this is the same  policy that you would have given me if I had just decided that I didn't feel  like taking a vacation this weekend.  In my opinion, this is an unacceptable  policy in the event of medical complications.  As you can see with my  situation, it is unlikely that my husband and I will be able to plan a  vacation by September of 2001 considering we will hopefully have a 2 month  old child.  I repeatedly asked Leroy if there was anyone else who could help  me or anyone I could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your  policy.  I indicated that I could provide a doctor's note if necessary.  He  was very rude to me, stating ""You don't have to ask me 7 different times for  the same thing - I already told you NO!""  I had to cancel a flight for work  about a month ago on Southwest airlines for the same reason, but I was hoping  that I would be able to fly again by now.  For your information, your  competitor was very helpful.  They accepted my doctor's note, gave me a  credit good for one year, and will allow me to change the ticket to another  person's name if I am still unable to use it.  That ticket was also booked as  a non-refundable fare.  Although I have always used Continental  for my  personal travel, the treatment I have had in this difficult time has  definitely made me second-guess my future choices.  If there is anything you  can do to help, I would greatly appreciate it.","Hello, my name is Tori Kuykendall (One Pass BJ927934).

2022-04-15 22:49:46+00:00,true,2,"  Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St.  Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline) has been the only pipeline into this market.     NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis  Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new  47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois  Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored  by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will  add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis  market.   ""The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing  strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets  currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by  adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network,"" said Richard D.  Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL.   The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois  Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is  scheduled for completion in June of 2002.   NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and  storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002,  which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In  addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation  agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf  Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000.   The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area  that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company  [Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer,  president of Illinois Power. ""This new connection to Illinois Power's system  will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the  metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point  to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the  area.   ""The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy  provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project,"" said Deb  Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest  from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season  will determine the final scope of the project.   ""With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the  St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of  interest,"" said Macdonald. ""We anticipate a strong response, however, given  the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power  generation.""   Interested shippers should contact Mark Menis, NGPL's director of business  development, at (630) 691-3347.

Sorry for my oversight.    Dale Nesbitt is the founder and President of Altos Management Partners.  Altos is a consulting and systems development firm that has visited Enron's offices on a couple of occasions to show us a computer model of the North American Natural Gas grid.  This was in conjunction with the Revenue Management project that Kim Watson headed up, but my group was also very interested in developing a more sophisticated (hopefully) analysis of pipeline flows, basis differentials, regional supply/demand, etc. for development of our short/long term strategies.    This model would accept a wide array of input data such as gas price curves, oil price curves, production potential of the major basins, regional market demand, pipeline tariffs, pipeline capacity limits, etc.  In theory, we could then have a more reasoned view of which pipelines would be either ""winners"" or ""losers"", which expansions would most likely be built, and what basis would exist at all pertinent trading points.  I understand that Enron already has a similar model for the electric generating/transmission grid in North America, and it has proven quite valuable.  In addition to the Altos model, we also looked at a model that had been developed by ICF Consulting.  Both companies made very impressive presentations and had obviously spent a great deal of time developing their work.  Vince Kaminski's research group has been involved in the evaluation of these two working models.  For comparison, Vince has also considered whether Enron should develop our own proprietary model in-house.    Vince now believes that the most cost effective way to get to final working model that we have confidence in, is to start with the Altos model and work with them to add/modify certain features.  The meeting with Dale Nesbitt is to explore this possibility.  I think it would be good to have another ETS representative (other than me) and possibly someone from NBP present at the meeting.  Both Margaret Carson and Vince Kaminski will attend.

The Agreement can terminate under 15.1(e) if a ""Judgment"" (court order, regulatory order etc.) determines that, as a result of Hub Transactions, Peoples is subject to comprehensive regulation as a natural gas co. or loses its Hinshaw status. Under 15.2, the Agreement terminates if it is found void or illegal, or at the option of either party if found void or illegal in part with frustration  of purpose. The intent of our wording in these sections, and the related definitions, is to eliminate the termination right (which was included in Peoples'intial draft) for a regulatory action, such as an ICC order which adopts an unfavorable ratemaking treatment for Hub revenues, but does not find the agreement to be illegal or void. The thought was that, after Peoples obtains an accpetable intial blessing from the ICC, the risk of some later regulatory action short of a finding of illegality should rest with Peoples during the Agreement's term.","_________________________________________________ This message and any attachments are intended for the individual or entity named above.

Jerry intends to file the entire Agreement ""under seal"" as a confidential document. (The ICC's procedural rules require the filing of a sealed and ""redacted"" version.) His intent is to try this approach initially, but then back of the proposal if the ICC Staff opposes designation of the entire document as confiential. In the event of Staff opposition, Jerry will discuss with us the portions of the document which are of primary concern and seek protection of those portions. (I mentioned to Jerry a recent ICC proceeding (last month) in which one of the parties sought blanket protection for an agreement. Due to staff opposition, a series of briefs regarding confidentiality were followed by a four hour hearing which examined every page of the document. Although a few items were ultimately protected, I believe the party involved wishes they had tried a different approach.) In any event, I think Jerry's plan to try the blanket approach initially, but then back off if opposition develops is reasonable.  ========== The preceding e-mail message (including any attachments) contains information that may be confidential, be protected by the attorney-client or other applicable privileges, or constitute non-public information.

(3) pg. 78 -- language to recognize that NOIE BUL loads will not have an ESI Id, and providing and alternative form of identification. (4) pg. 86 -- language to account for BUL participation by a dynamically scheduling QSE in the SCE calculation.  Changes (1), (2), and (4) apply only to dynamically schedulings QSEs with BULs.

2022-04-15 21:02:31+00:00,true,4,"  Happy belated Thanksgiving, everyone.   I am sorry to have taken so long to send you this Stacey report. I was down  in Corpus this past Tuesday and Wednesday and then up to Huntsville for  Thanksgiving with my folks, and just returned home this afternoon (Saturday).   Stacey is OUT of the comma!!!!!!! She emerged from it last Sunday. Needless  to say, Carolyn and John are just beside themselves. While I was with them on  Wed. morning, I was able to watch Stacey in her rehab and got to see her  write her name with her left hand. She also, just before I arrived, said  ""Momma"".  Guess What? I have really seem firsthand the miracle that we have  all been praying for.    I must admit that I was somewhat teary-eyed watching this precious little  girl do things that no one was sure that she would ever do again.  But, there  is still a long way to go.   Stacey's right arm is just kind of hanging from muscle atrophy. And, it is  giving her a lot of pain. (The good thing is that now she can tell the  doctors where the pain is located!) Also, it is going to take several more  months of rehab before she can go home. So, keep the prayers going.   As I entered the room, there was a man there who was leaving. Last December,  he was in an accident that left him in the same shape as Stacey. But now, he  is fully recovered. He came to the hospital because he had seen an article in  the Corpus Christi newspaper about Stacey. He said that he felt that he just  needed to let the family know that there really is hope and that you really  can fully recover. WOW! Does God have a sense of timing or what?   Carolyn wants everyone to know how much she loves you all and appreciates  your concern and your prayers. The hospital let them use a large room for  Thanksgiving Day dinner. They were even going to let Stacey have some of the  food with them. Talk about a Thanksgiving?   Folks, I must tell you that this has been exciting for me to see this miracle  unfold. I have enjoyed hearing from Carolyn and being able to report these  things to all of you. I wish that all of you could get to go and see these  people that we have all prayed for these past few months. It has been quite  an emotional deal for me to have seen a child that no one was sure would even  live and now see her awake and recognizing people around her and laughing and  crying and writing her name. Thanks for what you have done for her through  your prayers. And thanks for allowing me to send you these updates and to be  your eyes and ears. But, as I said earlier, we don't stop here. It's not over  until Stacey is 100%, and she will be! I will stay in touch with Carolyn and  keep you updated.   We do have much to be thankful for this year.  So, let's thank Him who is the  giver of all the good and perfect gifts, even life itself!   Be Blessed! Kent ","Happy belated Thanksgiving, everyone.

Eight months after release of the order, FCE will provide us with the  engineering drawings used to bid out FCE's scope of work.  We will have two  weeks to review and approve.  Twelve months after release of the order, FCE  will provide us with the final specs which will be based on the engineering  drawings.  I need you all to do the following:  1.  Review the conceptual specifications  2.  Review Exhibit C (below)  3.  Give me any conditions or constraints (in language) that we would like  to govern the process of going from the Preliminary Specifications to the  Engineering Drawings to the Final Specifications  4.

His initial reaction was that their  request was probably reasonable and in line with the spirit of a jointly  owned L.L.C.  However, he did suggest a couple slight revisions to protect  Enron's interests. 1) Highlighting that information will only be provided that is related to  enovate and 2) that each designated representative should sign an appropriate  confidentiality agreement.  This language has been included in the attached  draft.  My goal, however optimistic, is to execute the risk policy by the end  of today.  Activity is picking up dramatically and the fine line is getting  further blurred each passing day.  Therefore, I need to know ASAP if there  are any problems with the draft as written.  Otherwise, I will be sending it  to Peoples as our final revision by mid morning.  Thanks for your prompt  attention to this.

In light of the CA regarding curves, I  am slightly concerned with a blanket statement essentially giving Peoples  unlimited access to information. I know that we address audit rights in the  LLC agreement so this may not matter anyway if this is a right they already  have.  Let me know what you think.

2022-04-15 12:25:30+00:00,false,4,"  Here's how it is shaping up:  We have a fence appointment for noon, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.   That is the first opening, but there is always a chance of a cancellation.  Just in case there is an earlier opening, the utility people will be out  tomorrow. Therefore, we need to have BOTH dogs put up tomorrow, and the gate  open.  We have a noon appointment with John Foster THIS Wednesday.  There is a $20  consulting fee.  This is the same day Michael's class sings in chapel at 115,  so this isn't too bad.  I have a 130 staff meeting, but maybe I can miss it.   The work will NOT be done that day, as far as I know.  If we have  a hope of leaving town the week of Thanksgiving, we need a  reservation at the kennel.  Do we have one yet?  I would say we might want  one Fri and Sat night. Also, we might want to consider boarding Jack this  week for a couple of days, so we don't have to do the crate trip.

His initial reaction was that their  request was probably reasonable and in line with the spirit of a jointly  owned L.L.C.  However, he did suggest a couple slight revisions to protect  Enron's interests. 1) Highlighting that information will only be provided that is related to  enovate and 2) that each designated representative should sign an appropriate  confidentiality agreement.  This language has been included in the attached  draft.  My goal, however optimistic, is to execute the risk policy by the end  of today.  Activity is picking up dramatically and the fine line is getting  further blurred each passing day.  Therefore, I need to know ASAP if there  are any problems with the draft as written.  Otherwise, I will be sending it  to Peoples as our final revision by mid morning.  Thanks for your prompt  attention to this.

In the current S&S TPA, in Section 17.6, ""Seller  Remedies"" the remedies are termination and LDs for the cancellation charge.

I know that GE did not mention this in our  call.  What will Devco be able to do, just in case GE asks about this?    Otherwise the draft l;ooks good and we await GE's comments.  The guay at GE  to send this to by the way is Paul Miller@ps.ge.com.  Thanks!

2022-04-15 21:45:09+00:00,true,4,"  Eric-  I revised the contract you sent me to make it site specific.  Those changes  are redlined.  Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.3  as well as the defined terms that go with them.  These were related to  exhaust temperature and energy.  I know this is a simple cycle plant and they  typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would guarantee it  anyway.  It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes combined  cycle.  If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that out,  then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 (and  their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust  guarantees.  Let me know what they decide.  Exhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached to  your file.  (It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.)  I  therefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it.  It is now attached as a  separate word file.   Exhibit F is ""boiler plate"" and shouldn't change.  Exhibit ""U"" is not in my  hard copy.  My copy only goes up to Exhibit ""T.""   If you get something from  GE on Exhibit ""U"", send it to me and I will be glad to review it.    If you have questions, give me a call.

2022-04-15 10:33:38+00:00,true,4,"  Scott,  As I preliminary answer, this language hasn't been approved by Deffner's  group, although it is based on language they have seen before.  It was my  understanding that you wanted to keep this deal off their radar screen, as  you didn't want them entering into the structuring picture until later.  We  can ask for a blessing on the language, but that will probably lead to  questions about how the deal will be structured, etc.  I am happy to access  the resources in their group, however.  FCE hasn't seen any of this language.  It was something I pulled together for  you to look at.  As for FCE's desire to assign in case of merger, etc, I think the language is  too broad.  In fact, I think assignment by them should require our consent.  Otherwise, it needs to be conditioned on the acquiring party to be acquiring  a bunch of stuff:  the know how, the patent rights, the manufacturing  facilities, etc.  If they are going to merge with another company or sell  their shares, they don't need an assignment clause, unless there is something  peculiar in Conn. law.  They only need assignment language for an asset sale.

My guess is that FCE will want condition 6(a) to apply to all the  assignments.  5.  Has anyone from Deffner's group approved this language? 6.  My guess is that FCE will reject this language as being too broad.  Have  you run it by them? 7.  For condition #1 to apply to CRRA, would we have to assign the agreement  to CRRA and then to the project financing?  The most likely scenario is this,  so we should make certain that it can happen under the agreement. 8.  What about the acquisition language that FCE proposed.

2022-04-15 22:57:31+00:00,true,4,"  ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED - DO NOT PRODUCE  Kay,  Thanks again for helping me out.  I wanted to pass on a few things that were  discussed immediately prior to the execution of the LOI just so that nothing  is lost in the changing of the guards.  1)  John Keffer asked ENA to determine whether the equity interest held by  ENA in the SPV must be a voting interest.  The concern here was that the LLC  Agreement was structured to have the 20% owner hold a non-voting member  interest and John wanted to be certain that this satisfied the terms of the  GE LM6000 contract;  2)  The LOI talks about the ""minimal representations"" that ENA will be  required to give to Coral in connection with the disposition of the 80%  member interest to the Acquisition Entity.  I spoke with Jim Shepherd  (internal counsel to Coral - who by the way was a colleague/friend of mine  when I was employed at Coral) and assured him that ENA would be willing to  provide the necessary reps to give Coral comfort that we hadn't done anything  with the SPV (i.e. incur liabilities or convey other interests in the SPV);  3)  Jim Shepherd and I also spoke about expressly incorporating the  confidentiality provisions of the LOI into the final deal documentation.  I  wanted to be certain that Coral could not discuss deal terms with anyone else  (for fear that the deal structure becomes known in the market place);  4)  On the matter of taxes, Don Whaley (of Coral) expressly agreed with Ben  Jacoby that all ad valorem taxes and other taxes associated with ownership  (and the sale/transfer) of the units would be borne by Coral.  This comment  about the ad valorem taxes (which aren't expressly stated in the LOI) is  particularly important because (as you know) we anticipate a $250,000 tax on  each turbine that is delivered prior to year end.  I believe that Ben wants  to execute a letter agreement with GE (similar to the one that was executed  for the first 14 units) pursuant to which we accept title/delivery in  consideration of a $300,000 waiver of cancellation fees.  I have reservations  about this because ENA will effectively be making an additional 300k per unit  by stuffing a $250,000 obligation to Coral.  Doesn't really pass the smell  test in my book.  5)  One final item, this deal has not been DASHed and a legal risk memo has  not been prepared.  I would think that the biggest legal risk in this  transaction is the risk of discovery of the true deal structure by GE.  I  prepared a legal risk memo that highlighted this risk when I did the original  deal with Air Liquide and am happy to share that with you if you so desire.  Again, many thanks.

2022-04-15 22:49:33+00:00,true,4,"  Fuel cells kindle investor energy By Beverly Goodman Redherring.com, November 27, 2000  Companies with no earnings. Market capitalizations in the billions even  though revenue hovers in the tens of millions. Analyst optimism bordering on  the feverish. We know -- this probably sounds all too familiar. But this time  we're not talking about some pie-in-the-sky dot-com stock valuations. We're  talking about companies with new technologies, tangible assets, and a clear  source of future revenue. We're talking about makers of fuel cells, a highly  efficient and environmentally sound means of generating electricity.  And while we won't deny that the recent run-up in their stocks befits the  pattern of investor enthusiasm for the latest fad, we at Red Herring expect  that alternative energy will be in fashion for quite some time. Investors  more interested in companies that sell dog food over the Internet can stop  reading here. There's no mystery why fuel cells are an appealing source of energy: they  provide more reliable and efficient power with lower emissions and noise than  traditional generating sources (see Trend No. 9: Energy, December 4). Most  only require the simplest of gases and throw off only water and heat as  by-products, both of which are reusable. Simply put, fuel cells consist of  hydrogen and oxygen, separated by a catalyst. Typically, the fuel cell is  heated, causing a chemical reaction that generates electricity. Since nothing  is burned, no pollutants are created. In time, proponents say, fuel cells  will power everything from your cell phone to your car to the factories that  manufacture them. During this era of greater environmental awareness and rising fuel prices,  fuel cell technology is increasingly looking like an appealing investment.  Stocks powered by fuel cell technology are up an average of 139 percent in  the last 12 months. That's despite a slow recovery from the 40 percent hit  they took in the spring. The Nasdaq, by comparison, has fallen 15 percent  since last November. Investor interest has also prompted a recent spate of IPOs. H Power (Nasdaq:  HPOW), Millennium Cell (Nasdaq: MCEL), and Proton Energy Systems (Nasdaq:  PRTN) all went public within the past few months. While those IPOs may seem  to coincide neatly with the rising cost of fuel, that's not the whole  picture. ""We're seeing a convergence of factors never seen before,"" says  William Fogel, a power technology analyst for First Albany. ""The deregulation  in the utility industry has increased innovation; the transportation grid is  in jeopardy thanks to an increase in electrical demand from an Internet-based  economy; there's a growing need for increased reliability; and there's an  increasing recognition of the environmental degradation caused by the  combustion engine."" Admittedly, truly widespread applications remain more than a decade away, so  profits are similarly distant for fuel cell companies. But investors have  proven themselves willing to invest in technologies long before they become  mainstream, buying stocks that often defy traditional valuations. (Still  holding JDS Uniphase (Nasdaq: JDSU)?) With early-stage fuel cell technology  due out of the labs and available to individual and corporate consumers  within the year, this is still the early part of the adoption (and investing)  curve. CELL DIVISION The fuel cell market is generally divided into four segments: stationary,  portable, residential, and automotive. Fuel cells will likely hit the large  stationary market first, powering strip malls and factories, according to  David Redstone, editor of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Investor newsletter.  ""We're talking about unprecedented efficiency,"" he says, noting that fuel  cells approach 60 percent efficiency (that is, 60 percent of the potential  energy in fuel entering the cell actually results in energy coming out). Fuel cells can also be coupled with turbines to get their efficiency up to 80  percent, whereas traditional combustion engines only run at 35 percent  efficiency. The leading developer of these stationary cells is Fuelcell  Energy (Nasdaq: FCEL) (FCE), which is poised to be the first to commercialize  them in 2001. At first blush, FCE's 442 percent run-up in the last 12 months  and the fact that it won't be profitable until 2006 doesn't make its $59.50  stock price and price/sales ratio of 58 seem cheap. But using a variety of  metrics, including discounted cash flow, discounted 2006 net income, and  discounted 2006 revenue, Lehman Brothers analyst Maureen Murphy considers FCE  undervalued by 40 percent. Using a projected market value of five times  estimated 2006 revenue of $1 billion, she applies a discount rate of 17.5  percent annually to arrive at a 12-month price target of $124. Portable applications for fuel cells, like generators and boat engines, are  also expected to be commercialized soon. Ballard Power Systems (Nasdaq: BLDP ), with more than 370 patents issued or pending, has proven itself in nearly  all fuel cell applications and has promised to bring a small fuel  cell-powered generator to market in 2001. ""They don't make promises they're  not able to keep,"" says Christine Farkas, a senior specialist and director at  Merrill Lynch. ""They've never disappointed."" Ballard has also made  significant strides in the automotive market and owns 27 percent of Xcellsis,  a fuel cell engine maker that is a joint venture with DaimlerChrysler (NYSE:  DCX) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F). Analysts expect Ballard to continue to post losses until sometime in 2004,  and its current price-to-sales ratio is a whopping 265. Still, Ballard's  involvement in all aspects of fuel cell applications leads Ms. Farkas to  expect the company to earn $24.22 per share by 2013 -- which works out to  approximately $2.2 billion in net income. Applying a multiple of 25 to those  earnings, and a 15 percent discount rate, she comes up with a projected stock  price of $150 a year from today, or 93 percent above recent prices. INDUSTRY REVOLUTION Even though powering cars with fuel cells is still some years off, the notion  has found allies in some unlikely industries -- the major oil and automotive  sectors. Ford chairman William Clay Ford Jr. declared at the 2000 Detroit  Auto Show, ""Longer term, the fuel cell will end the 100-year reign of the  internal combustion engine."" Legislation such as California's mandate that by  2003 fully 10 percent of cars sold (an estimated 22,000) must run on  alternative energy will also help speed industry and public acceptance. While not a pure-play on fuel cells, Impco Technologies is well positioned to  see its fuel cell business grow along with its other alternative fuel  delivery, storage, and power electronics systems. Mr. Fogel expects Impco's  products to compete for 40 percent, or $5 billion of the forecasted $12.5  billion automotive fuel cell market in 2010. (Its much more down-to-earth P/S  ratio of 1.6 is an added attraction for investors -- any risk involved in  Impco's fuel cell development is hedged by its full involvement in the  alternative fuel industry.) ""They're involved with almost every aspect of  General Motors's global alternative fuel production, design, and  implementation efforts,"" Mr. Fogel says. Impco was hit particularly hard this spring, and is still, at $18, 65 percent  off its March 6 high of $52. But by using a 45 multiple on projected 2006  earnings per share of $2.86 and applying a 20 percent discount, Mr. Fogel  arrives at a price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio of less than one -- a  conservative multiple for stocks with similar growth prospects. Mr. Fogel  sees more than a 100 percent upside for the company's stock, expecting it to  return to its high in the coming 12 months. Despite the industry hype and science fiction scenarios, there will  inevitably be setbacks. Take, for example, Plug Power (Nasdaq: PLUG), which  ran out of gas when General Electric (NYSE: GE), which owns one-third of a  joint venture with Detroit Edison (NYSE: DTA) and Plug, decided to change  course. Plug's trailing 12-month revenue of $13 million (giving it a  price-to-sales ratio of 64) hinged on the venture, in which a fuel cell  powered a house, independent of the local electrical grid. Instead, GE now  wants to develop a ""grid parallel"" system, which would work in tandem with  the existing system. That news, coupled with management woes and Nasdaq  turbulence, sent Plug's share price falling 80 percent, from $140 on March 13  to $16.50 on November 24. It will take all the energy fuel cells can generate  to get that stock back on track.

As for my  signature authority, I am expecting that I would need to sign on behalf of  enovate, L.L.C., Enron MW, L.L.C. and I suppose Enron North America by  association.  The dollar amount can be set as low as practical.  I think in  the L.L.C. agreement the Board reserves the right to approve contracts in  excess of $50,000.  The real need is for pushing paper such as CA's, Master  Purchase Agreements, etc.  Here is another question, if my authority is  limited, who has the authority to sign in excess of my limit?  Laura Luce  previously had such authority as General Manager (she is a VP at ENA).  If  she now becomes the Board Member, can she also sign on behalf of enovate?  If  so, is that because she is an officer of Enron MW or because she is a Board  Member (i.e., can Peoples Board Member sign on behalf of enovate)?

My suggestion would be that Richard and myself be  granted some level of authority to execute CA's, Master Agreements, etc. that  have been reviewed and approved by legal.  If you can at least pull the  template you used to get approval for the Director you mentioned and see if  there would be any changes necessary that would be helpful.  3) I need to get the CA form for the curves and other information started.

I believe we can support this change as long as few questions are properly handled:  If there are multiple units that can clear the local congestion problem, who gets selected?  (best shift factor, submitted dec bids, ERCOT flips a coin?)  If a generator fails to follow this instruction will it properly show up as an uninstructed deviation, or will ERCOT follow performance to these direct instructions some other way?

The references in the recitals, 3.8(c),7.2.4, 30.7 and 30.12 can be  handled fairly easily.  The references in 5.1 and 6.1 deal with pricing  matters and will require a little work once the pricing mechanism is worked  out with GE.

2022-04-15 22:12:49+00:00,true,4,"  these are neat. regards.  scott.  FIVE GREAT LESSONS:  1 -   Most Important Lesson - During my second month of nursing school, our  professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed  through the questions,until I read the last one: ""What is the first name of  the woman who cleans the school?"" Surely this was some kind of joke. I had  seen the cleaning woman several times.  She was tall, dark-haired and in her  50s, but how would I know her name?  I handed in my paper, leaving the last  question blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if the last  question would count toward our quiz grade. ""Absolutely,"" said the professor.  ""In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They  deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say  'hello'."" ""I've never forgotten that lesson.  I also learned her name was  Dorothy.  2 - Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain. One night, at 11:30 PM, an  older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway  trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had broken down and she  desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next  car.  A young white man stopped to help her, generally unheard of in those  conflict-filled 1960s. The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance  and put her into a taxi cab. She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down  his address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's  door. To his surprise, a giant console color TV was delivered to his home. A  special note was attached. It read: ""Thank you so much for assisting me on  the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able  to make it to my dying husband's bedside just before he passed away.  God  bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others."" Sincerely, Mrs. Nat  King  Cole.  3 - Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve. In the days  when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy entered a hotel  coffee shop and sat at a table.  A waitress put a glass of water in front of  him. ""How much is an ice cream sundae?"" he asked. ""Fifty cents,"" replied the  waitress. The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the  coins in it. ""Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?"" he inquired. By  now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing  impatient. ""Thirty-five cents,"" she brusquely replied."" The little boy again  counted his coins.  ""I'll have the plain ice cream,"" he said.  The waitress  brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy  finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left. When the waitress came  back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. There, placed neatly  beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies - You see, he  couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left to leave her a  tip.  4 -  Fourth Important Lesson - The Obstacle in Our Path. In ancient times, a  King had a boulder placed on a roadway. then he hid himself and watched to  see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king's wealthiest  merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it.  Many loudly  blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about  getting the stone out of the way. Then a peasant came along carrying a load  of vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move  the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he  finally succeeded.  After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he  noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse  contained many gold coins and a note from the king  indicating that the gold  was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant  learned what many of us never understand. Every obstacle presents an  opportunity to improve our condition.   5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts. Many years ago, when I  worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz  who was suffering from a rare and serious disease. Her only chance of  recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who  had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies  needed to combat the illness. The doctor explained the situation to her  little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his  blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a  deep breath and saying, ""Yes, I'll do it if it will save her."" As the  transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we  all did, seeing the color returning to her cheeks. Then his face grew pale  and his smile  faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling  voice, ""Will I start to die right away?"" Being young, the little boy had  misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister  all of his blood in order to save her. You see, after all, understanding and  attitude, are everything.","This is neat. regards. scott.

Apparently, if AE takes early title, they will be  able to pay for the equipment (approx $440,000) from another fund and avoid  the appearance of being over budget on the 4 LM project. Based upon my discussions with various internal groups, ENA is comfortable  with either option #2 or option #3 below.  See the tax response from Warren  below.  David Marshall is comfortable from an insurance perspective.  Kay  Mann (lawyer on GE breakout contract) confirmed in a voicemail that she did  not anticipate the title transfer creating an issue with the warranties  granted to ENA in the breakout agreement. Keenan phoned Chris Kirksey yesterday to relay the message that based upon  preliminary discussions, we are comfortable with either approach.  Next Steps:  Jeffrey anticipates hearing from Chris today to get preliminary feedback on  if Austin needs title (option #3) or if the ""acknowledgement letter"" (option  #2) would suffice. Monday, December 4, there is an internal meeting to discuss the topic.   Let me know if you have any thoughts or concerns.

A couple of thoughts came to mind and we need  your opinion on these matters so we can take the most appropriate steps  necessary to reduce the potential tax liability.  First, a couple of facts for clarification:  It is anticipated the turbines (and transformers) will be on the City of  Austin site on or before 12/31/00 (the City owns the land); It is anticipated ENA will be the legal owner of the assets on 12/31/00 (the  NEPCO assignment will not be complete); Under the current participation agreement, the City of Austin will not take  title to their 91.4% ownership until the plant is complete and successfully  tested (sometime 1Q 2001); However, by 12/31/00 the City of Austin will have paid for 100% of their  ownership in the plant ($85,641,800); The tax liability could be $250,000 per turbine, $1,000,000 in total.  The thoughts/ideas are as follows:  Is it reasonable to assume the Travis County taxing authorities will not tax  the equipment at all because it will be located on land owned by the City of  Austin at year end?  What is the probability they will actually review items  of the property and trace legal owner? If #1 above is a risky position, and one you would not support, would it be  acceptable to the taxing authorities, in your opinion,  for ENA and the City  of Austin to sign a letter stating that ENA is simply holding title to the  equipment for the benefit of the City of Austin.  Therefore, because of this  and the fact that the City has paid for its 91.4% ownership, only the 8.6% is  taxable. If neither #1 or #2 are acceptable in you view, would it be acceptable for  ENA and Austin sign a side letter agreement to officially convey 91.4% of the  project to the City of Austin, but totally indemnify the City of Austin from  all liabilities.  After year-end, ENA would ""take back"" the conveyance and  the plant would continue in ENA's name until the plant is officially  conducted its final performance tests.  Please provide your thoughts on these ideas as soon as possible.  If these do  not work, we need some creative thinking on your behalf to minimize the  liability.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

The first contract  is for a $5.4 million project with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)  National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) for the design, construction and  operation of a 250 kW DFC, utilizing coal mine methane gas, at the Harrison  Mining Corporation coal mine in Cadiz, Ohio. The second contract, for  $100,000, is from the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center in  Groton, Connecticut for a remote location, 3 kW fuel cell power system, using  methanol for fuel. It is scheduled to be installed during the second quarter  of 2001 at the Cape Henry Lighthouse at Fort Story, near Virginia Beach, VA.   Coal Mine Methane: Cost-Free Fuel Reduces Emissions   FuelCell Energy was selected for the coal mine methane emission reduction  project to demonstrate the ability of the DFC to generate electricity, using  coal mine methane emissions that otherwise escape into the atmosphere. Costs  for the three-year program will be shared equally by the DOE and FuelCell  Energy. As a result, in addition to the environmental benefits of reducing  emissions, the cost of electricity produced from coal mine methane is reduced  by using a fuel that is essentially free.   ""The DOE has been supporting the development of fuel cells for more than two  decades,"" said Mark C. Williams, fuel cell product manager for NETL. ""This  application to coal mine methane effectively combines efficient power  generation with a solution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.""   According to FuelCell Energy, 75% of the world's coal mine methane emissions  from active and abandoned coal mines comes from the top six countries with  coal mining operations. A total of approximately 1,000 megawatts of fuel cell  power could be generated using coal mine methane from the two sources. The  U.S., alone, has approximately 300 megawatts of unutilized coal mine methane  capacity. At an estimated $1,000 kW, the 1,000 MW worldwide potential for  FuelCell Energy fuel cell power plants is equivalent to a $1.0 billion  market.   ""The use of coal mine methane to power Direct FuelCells will result in  benefits for all concerned,"" said Jerry D. Leitman, president and CEO of  FuelCell Energy. ""Coal mine methane is a greenhouse gas which can be  remediated. By using it to fuel a DFC power plant, a customer turns a  liability into an asset that gets rid of a polluting gas and produces  electric power in an environmentally responsible fashion. An important  milestone for the company is to identify prospective early-adopter markets.  The coal mine methane market provides a virtually free fuel source to operate  the fuel cells, facilitating early adoption by energy users.""   Remote Power: Clean Energy Where the Wires End   The U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center has awarded FuelCell  Energy a $100,000 contract to provide a 3 kW DFC power plant at the Cape  Henry Lighthouse, for a field test at the lighthouse to demonstrate fuel cell  capabilities at remote sites. The Coast Guard operates several hundred  unattended power systems at remote site communication stations, radio  navigation stations, weather stations, and aids to navigation such as  lighthouses, structures, and buoys. Stand alone fuel cell power systems offer  efficiency and environmental advantages for remote site operation. The  methanol fuel allows for simpler, more compact process equipment for FuelCell  Energy's Direct FuelCell plant compared to other fuel sources.   ""This demonstration project by FuelCell Energy is the first application of  fuel cells at a remote, unmanned site in a marine environment"", said Walt  Lincoln, project manager of the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development  Center. ""We're interested in the potential of the fuel cell because of its  promise of reduced maintenance and greater reliability compared to other  systems.""   ""In addition to the unattended applications for the Coast Guard, there are  other potential remote power applications in operation around the world, such  as pipeline monitoring, microwave relay stations, and numerous other  communications and recreational uses that could be served by fuel cells,""  said Leitman.   Using carbonate fuel cell technology, the DFC(R) power plant produces high  efficiency energy through an electro-chemical reaction, rather than through  combustion. This method of producing power gives energy users the option of  producing electricity on site with the assurance of lower emissions, less  noise and with shorter timeframes required for the permitting process.   About FuelCell Energy, Inc.   FuelCell Energy, Inc. - www.fce.com - formerly Energy Research Corp., is a  leading developer of carbonate fuel cell technology for stationary power  generation. The Company's Direct FuelCell technology eliminates external fuel  processing to extract hydrogen from a hydrocarbon fuel. This results in a  product whose cost, combined with high efficiency, simplicity and  reliability, results in product advantages for stationary power generation.  FuelCell Energy, based in Danbury, CT is developing Direct FuelCell(R) power  plants with nominal ratings of 300 kW, 1.5 MW and 3 MW.. The Company has been  developing DFC(R) technology for stationary power plants with the U.S.  Department of Energy through the National Energy Technology Laboratory  (NETL). The NETL's advanced fuel cell research program is focused on  developing a new generation of high performance fuel cells that can generate  clean electricity at power stations or in distributed locations near the  customer, including hospitals, schools, data centers and other commercial and  industrial applications.

2022-04-15 21:02:39+00:00,true,4,"  Kay:  Here is a proposed correction to the first sentence of section 14.3 of the agreement.  We had offered a 15% reduction in efficiency in our warranty. When we changed efficiency to heat rate, we neglected to correct the percentage change because heat rate goes up as efficiency declines. Mathematically, there is an inverse relationship (see attached spreadsheet) which means that the equivalent of a 15% reduction in efficiency is an 18% increase in heat rate. Therefore we propose to change the Heat Rate reduction in the first sentence of Section 14.3 (also attached) from 15% to 18% and correspondingly revise the total change from 20% to 23%.   <<14.3 revision.doc>>  <<eff and heat rate.xls>>  Ross M.

At this point FCE will only guaranty 60dba, which some  folks might not consider to be extremely quiet depending on how close a  facility is to their house.

We need to secure it to prevent other houses from being built on our  perimeter (sound receptors).  We have just worked hard to buy the other two  houses adjacent to the property to fix this problem.  Its a nice situation  since the tract is long and narrow, so we get maximum sound receptor  protection for minimal acreage purchases.  I had sent a memo to Karen Way a  while back asking them to work on this and you cautioned me to make sure I  ran kick off of outside counsel on a project past you first (if that jogs  your memory).    Anyway, this is a finishing touch on Pontiac, and I have promised the  landowner a document a while back, so I would appreciate our turning it to  him in the near future.  I have been preoccupied on some stuff in Florida,  but feel badly that we haven't gotten this out to this guy sooner.  I will  make the apology phone call (blame the big company lawyers - of course) and  let him know its on its way and not to give up on us.  Kathleen and I have already discussed this today.

Since our critical final zoning vote is next Thursday, I want to make sure we  don't give him any reason to get ""up in arms"" over this issue and start  thinking we have just been leading him along without intending to follow  through on the deal.  Mark and Karen have done such an exemplary job on the  zoning (record time) that I don't want anything to get in our way at the  final moment.  Mr. Schaeffer is one of the wealthier and more influential  farmers in the area, and has thus far been pretty quiet at the meetings,  however, he pointedly cornered me at the end of our last meeting to ask about  this issue.

Also enclosed are redlined drafts of each marked to reflect revisions from the initial drafts furnished earlier today.  We believe that our revised description of the ""transaction"" in the Letter Agreement (which now provides that each event is a condition precedent to the other and is deemed to have occurred simultaneous with the other) should satisfy your concerns as to both the creditworthiness issue and the timing issue.  At the closing, the signed Facility Agreement will not be ""delivered"" unless the loan is funded by Tejas.  With respect to your concern about confidentiality, we have reviewed the confidentiality provisions of the master contract.  One might conclude that the master contract does not expressly permit the disclosure of confidential information by Enron to prospective assignees, as a ""Permitted Assignee"" seems to include only an assignee who has received an assignment.  On the other hand, it is arguable that there would never be any assignee without some disclosure, so that disclosure to prospective assignees must have been intended by the parties.  Alternatively, query whether Enron's ""performance of its obligations"" under the master agreement could be construed to include using [and disclosing] confidential information in discussions with prospective assignees and their lenders, thereby permitting disclosure to Coral/Tejas under the second full paragraph of Section 21.1.  Assuming that we can satisfy ourselves with respect to this issue, it then seems prudent to require Coral/Tejas to immediately execute a Confidentiality Agreement containing confidentiality restrictions comparable to those set forth in the master agreement.  In the alternative, you may wish to revise the letter of intent (assuming it is to be executed momentarily) to include comparable confidentiality provisions.  Please review the enclosed and advise of any additional comments.  If we may be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to call.  Thank you.  Carolyn M.

Well, after several years of  fighting with the glasses, losing them, sitting on them, etc., etc., I opted  last year for a contact lense (i.e. one -- Mono Vision).  It has been trying  as you have to get used to focusing with one eye for reading and the other  for distance.    I had a conversation with my eye doctor yesterday, wanting a miracle cure,  you know, 20/20 vision in the form of, I don't know!!, a simple pair of  contacts?  Or, Was I a candidate for surgery?  He said that we (former  20/20's) were the worst when it came to contacts as we had the most difficult  time accepting our perfect vision loss.    Immediately, I was humbled....  ""Okay, okay, I hear you, I understand.""   At least I CAN see with corrective lenses, so what if it is not perfect.

2022-04-15 01:14:20+00:00,false,4,"  Hi Scott,  I have some questions:  The obligation to try to improve performance  about the specific performance  (ie minimum) standards frequently has a time limit, say 6 months.  Do you  have a sense for the appropriate time period here?  Would it make sense to  require them to work longer on the first 2.0 and 2.4 than the rest?  Will we have a drawing number for a standard foundation design, or will we  need to put words around it.  I know we discussed the need for pilings as the  most significant change.  Do you think that this difference is enough?  Did I  understand that we want them to pay us at the end for non-standard  foundations (as opposed to a credit).   On termination, are we going with the average value no matter what the reason  for termination, with a rep along the lines of whay you wrote, plus some  monitoring ability.  On assignment, they mentioned a corporate guaranty.  I was thinking of using  something broader due to various financing/balance sheet considerations,  perhaps tying it to a guaranty from a BBB rated entity.  Do we want an option to have them store these, which would then impact  payment?

2022-04-15 03:46:33+00:00,true,4,"  Dear Mr. Schrum,  I attended Sing! last night to watch and support my daughter perform with her  Tri Delta friends.  I enjoyed the performances of the various groups, which  were within the bounds of what I expected.  Unfortunately, I am not writing  to tell you how much I enjoyed it.  I'm writing  you to encourage the administration to not take lightly the  indecent exposure incident which occured in the second act.   The act was  beyond offensive, it was criminal, especially in light of the young children  present.  During the first act, I was sitting on the first row, and there  were 4 young children sitting in the front.  In fact,  at the end of the  first act I had regretted that I had not brought Paige's six year old brother  to watch her perform.  I cannot tell you how glad I am that I did not bring  Michael.   Even I was offended, and I'm a forty-two year old lawyer (we don't  offend easily) who was in a sorority at UT.  I was glad I had moved back at  intermission to sit with my daughter for the second act.  Again, I urge you to not view this as an act of youthful indiscretion. It was  offensive to the individuals present, and degrading to a fine university  which prides itself on ""encouraging contributions toward the well-being of  humanity"".  My husband, Neil, who was a Pike at SU in the seventies, joins me  in this request.  Thank you,  Kay Mann 29 Inverness Parkway Houston, Texas 77055","Dear Mr. Schrum, I attended Sing! last night to watch and support my daughter perform with her Tri Delta friends.

2022-04-15 05:34:52+00:00,true,4,"  Sheila:  Thanks for the article.  Water is definately a hot topic in the Chicago  area.  Our existing facility (Lincoln Energy Center) in Manhattan is in  pretty good shape with the GE Dry Low NOx burners.  At peak usage times the  plant requires a peak water usage of around 125 gallons per minute (gpm) or  120,000 gallons per day based on a 16-hour run schedule.  This is probably  one of the lowest water consumption levels of any power plant in Illinois.  The two other sites (Plano and Pontiac) which we have permitted this year  required significant discussion on the water usage issue.  In our local  zoning discussions/meetings we presented information that the proposed  facility would have an estimated maximum water usage of 1000 gpm (this  equates to approximately 1,000,000 gallons per day on a 16-hr basis).  This  was based on an equipment configuration of 10 LM 6000 units, which we felt  was a fairly conservative water use estimate.  Our Kendall County Special Use Permit for the Plano site has a specific  condition on water usage which limits the maximum draw from on-site wells to  1000 gpm based on a 24-hour average.  I believe that this translates into a  instantaneous maximum of approximately 1350 gpm.  This amount was determined  by an ENSR study of the amount of water that could be withdrawn from the deep  acquifer without impacting the overall levels of the acquifer.  The City of  Yorkville Annexation Agreement on the Plano site does not impose a maximum  water usage quantity.  The attached article suggest that some water use limitations may be imposed  by the State of Illinois.  I will check with our Chicago council to determine  if such limitations would override zoning permits which have been already  validly issued.  My suspicion is that the State limitations would govern  given that such limits are being designed specifically for peaker plants.  I  will let you know.

2022-04-15 22:20:25+00:00,true,4,"  This is from Carol Word, she is working on the Prayer List and will send it  shortly.  Hello all.  My husband and I just returned from a trip to the Alsace region of France over the Thanksgiving holiday and I thought I would pass on a little something that applies to the Christmas season I learned.  Alsace lies at the It seems the tradition of decorating a tree for Christmas began in this area (if there were no borders it would be part of the Black Forest region of Germany).  The Alsacians are a generous, hardworking, loving people as a whole.  Many wonderful people have come from this region. One of the greatest is Dr. Albert Schweitzer.  Dr. Schweitzer began as a master organist, built them actually and wrote books about them.  Then, he felt called to the ministry and was a pastor with a compassionate heart.  He was in Paris at a missions conference and was moved to hear of the tribes in Africa, lost, without hope, practically no medical care and felt the Holy Spirit move in his life once again.  He studied medicine and he, his wife and a team of compassionate men and women moved to Gabon on the West Coast of Africa and opened a hospital.  There, they cared for the sick in body and spirit.  The tradition of the Christmas tree began in the early 1500's.  There was a pastor who was coming home in the early winter evening having visited a parishioner.  It was nearing the time of celebrating the Birth of Jesus.  As he made his way through the dark woods, he came upon a fir tree bathed in light.  It seemed a star sat upon the top of the tree.  The sight held such wonder that he wanted to share it with his family.  Then, he began to see the true story and felt that maybe it was not just coincidence that he happened up that sight.  He cut the tree and began to dress it up in red with white candles for his church and here is what he told the people (in my words of course):  The tree is to remind us why Jesus came.  He came to die upon the tree for our freedom.  The evergreen represents life even when death is all around (all the other trees loose their leaves and ""die"") but only the evergreen goes against the flow.  Its life flows from deep within.  The life of the Christian flows from deep within.  So, the tree represents life.  The red ribbons and bow represent His Blood shed for us.  The scarlet ribbon that covers the tree as His Blood that covers our sins.  The white candles represent (1) purity - we are cleansed and made pure through the shed blood upon the tree, and (2) Light - that Jesus is the Light of the World and the light on the tree is the Light on our lives.  He said WE are the light of the world when we allow Him to live in us.  As time passed, all kinds of things have been added and the REAL purpose of the tree has been forgotten.  One more VERY important thing that is added to a European tree is the manger.  It is set up under the tree in the center with a place of prominence.  Usually, the Christ Child is not added until Christmas morning.  The tree in Europe is left in place until January when the Three Wise Men came from the east to worship the King and this is when gifts are usually exchanged.  While I love the giving (and the getting!) and the gathering and the eating all the fun things that go with Christmas as much as the next person and maybe more than some, I would like to encourage us all as we enter the season.  If you have an artificial or real tree, a ""color theme"" or mix and match, as you set the tree, remember Who died on a tree for you and your home.  Let it represent in your home His sacrifice on the bare tree.  Let's pray for the opportunity to witness in a different way to our unsaved friends and family.  If you have a tree in your home this year, and you have unsaved family, as you decorate it, each time you admire it, pray  ""Father, let this tree represent You in this home.  Let Your Light shine through me.  Let me share Your gifts You have given me with those You place in my path.  As I wrap each present, I pray Your anointing goes with that gift.  Let the sweater, the scarf, the article of clothes represent Your covering over that loved one.  Let that toy bring joy to that child and open a way for me to minister in a fresh way to that young heart.  Each time the keyboard on that computer is touched, as I touch it, Lord, I know Your Spirit linger there as it did for Elijah on that bed and the child was raised.  I want Your resurrection power to flow through me to each person You have given me to care for.  As I hang ornaments on the tree, let each one represent a habit, a fear, a concern, a pain, a past unforgiven, a sickness, a financial burden, a child, a husband, a wife, a future unknown and uncertain, and the act of hanging be an act of faith of hanging it on the cross.  An act of placing that care in Your capable Hands.  As the lights are strung on the tree and home, let Your light shine through me. Let my home be a beacon of Your Love in a dark, hurting, crying, sighing, dying world.  As I meet with friends and family and reach out to hug, let my arms be Your Arms reaching out in love.  Use me, mold me, make me what I ought to be so I can be more like You.  In Jesus' Name...Amen!""  Just a thought I wanted to share.  We have a chance to make a real difference in our homes as we allow Jesus to make a difference in our hearts.  I love you all....Carol Word ","This is from Carol Word, she is working on the Prayer List and will be sending it shortly. Hello all.

I understand that  these documents are intended to be confidential and are not to be shared with  third parties, including vendors, subcontractors,  or other counterparties.

The form EPC will be to some extent pre-approved by the  lenders for use with the Turbo Park facility.

The degree of sign-off and the ability to make changes after that  sign-off is unclear  to me, but at this point I am not aware of any  particular construction project that the form must be made to fit by Friday.  [I have not  been provided with any forms of attachments, and suspect that  none need to be produced by this Friday. Roseann or Sheila, could you find  out from your teams if this is the case?]  Larry Izzo has asked that Peter Nassab have John Rigby get involved in the  review of the attached contract, and that Dick Westfahl be made aware of the  matter since NEPCO will be the contractor for these projects as a general  rule.  David Lund has asked that Gene Larson look it over for NEPCO.  I  suggest that you start with the attached comments before you launch into the  drafts themselves.  We are  arranging a meeting with ENA and Enron Global Finance to coordinate  discussion of these comments, any additional comments from EECC and NEPCO,  and what EECC and NEPCO should expect from the Turbo Park project in the near  term, and will get back to you as soon as this is arranged. With any luck at  all, this effort will lead to a standard from not ionly for use with Turbo  Park, but also for general use between EECC/NEPCO and ENA, and thereby  significantly reduce transactions costs and time going forward.  Roseann and Sheila, please forward this as appropriate to your respective  team members and let us know when you have had a chance to digest the changes.  1. EECC/NEPCO legal comments   2.

So the boss said to both teams, ""Here's what we'll do. Each team will be  installing poles out on the new road. The team that installs the most poles  gets the job."" Both teams headed right out. At end of shift, one team came  back and the boss asked them how many they had installed and they said   they'd put 12 in. Forty-five minutes later, the other team came back in and  they were dragging. The boss said, ""Well, how many poles did you guys  install?"" The team leader wiped his brow and sighed, ""We got three in.""     The boss gasped, ""Three? Those other guys put 12 in!""     ""Yeah,"" said the leader, ""But you should see how much they left sticking  out!""

His initial reaction was that their  request was probably reasonable and in line with the spirit of a jointly  owned L.L.C.  However, he did suggest a couple slight revisions to protect  Enron's interests. 1) Highlighting that information will only be provided that is related to  enovate and 2) that each designated representative should sign an appropriate  confidentiality agreement.  This language has been included in the attached  draft.  My goal, however optimistic, is to execute the risk policy by the end  of today.  Activity is picking up dramatically and the fine line is getting  further blurred each passing day.  Therefore, I need to know ASAP if there  are any problems with the draft as written.  Otherwise, I will be sending it  to Peoples as our final revision by mid morning.  Thanks for your prompt  attention to this.

In light of the CA regarding curves, I  am slightly concerned with a blanket statement essentially giving Peoples  unlimited access to information.

2022-04-15 01:28:00+00:00,true,4,"  Scott,  Your question #2 raises a good point. My thought in bracketing the name is  optionality.  I'm trying to be aware of potential balance sheet issues.  As you know, if  this contract ends up in such shape that it can be construed as a committment  to purchase equipment, we will need to cross the balance sheet bridge.  As  far as I know, we have not ruled out that possibility, as well as the  possibility that ENA or an affilate may be the EPC contractor, or somehow in  the title chain. I was thinking that if we use an LLC we have the option to  see .he equity in an LLC holding the contractual rights/obligations (for  financing purposes or otherwise).  In that case, we may want to use an LLC  instead of messing with an assignment later.  I am very interested in your insight concerning possible structures, and what  we need to keep in mind.

Here  are my comments thru Section 5.  1.  Shouldn't the agreement be in the name of ENA? 2.  Section 2.1--We should have the right to change the persons identified  listed in Section 2.1 (a) & (b), particularly if we assign.  Do we need a  procedure? 3.  Section 2.1 (d)--Shouldn't it just say ""highway"" as opposed to ""major  highway""? 4.  Section 2--Need to add the following concept.  90 days after RTO,  Purchaser shall identify up to [5] primary or alternative sites for  installation of the units (identification to include an expected  configuration).  Upon 10 day notice, Purchaser shall have the right to  substitute sites or change site configurations.  The project plans shall be  based on the primary configurations identified by Purchaser.  4 months prior  to shipment, Purchaser must identify the site where a unit must go.  At this  point, the site is locked in for that unit. 5.  Section 3.3 (c)--insert ""or as reasonably required to implement"" after  ""as required by"". 6.  Section 3.16--Add in concept of identified sites.  Timing of plans should  coincide with site identification. 7.  Section 5.1.1--Incorprate concept that shipping per unit is based on the  lesser of actual costs or $87,000 per unit.  I think that FCE agreed to this  concept. 8.

In the last year, I handled one affiliated interest agreement approval, which required only five weeks from filing to the time of the Order. Staff viewed the agreement as non-contoversial and wanted to dispose of the matter quickly. In another case, with staff copperation, the time from filing to approval (expected today), was nine weeks. On the other hand, when staff perceives an actual or potential issue, cases can drag on for months. I am handling one approval proceeding (involving acquisition of a small water utility system) which is expected to require about nine months to complete. In that case, staff argued that it needed 3-4 months to complete discoverey and prepare its direct evidence. Time was also included for two separate rounds of testimony (which is standard at the ICC), the hearing, briefing, issuance of Examiner's order, and filing of Exceptions and Replies. If Staff seeks to schedule all of the available procedural steps (which it can do if it so chooses), it is difficult to complete a case of this type in less than 6 months. A realistic time frame for a contested case would be 5-9 months. To avoid this, it is important to meet with the staff early on and resolve their concerns informally. This should be done, if possible, before the first scheduling conference (likely to be held about 3 weeks after the Petition is filed). If agreement is not reached beofre the first conference with the Hearing Examioner, the established schedule for the case should build in one or more early status conferences which provide the opportunity to present a settlement and resolve the matter at an early stage.  ========== The preceding e-mail message (including any attachments) contains information that may be confidential, be protected by the attorney-client or other applicable privileges, or constitute non-public information.

2022-04-15 01:26:09+00:00,true,4,"  I wanted to clarify our game plan for the next couple of weeks.  1.  Tomorrow a meeting is taking place with FuelCells to resolve some major  outstanding business issues.  At this meeting, the point is going to be made  that in order to maintain the desired schedule, FCE is going to have to  increase its technical effort.  Presently, we are concerned that the  technical aspects of the purchase order are not in sufficient order to  finalize a purchase order by next week (we want to make certain that our deal  with FuelCells is largely defined before we make a state filing).  We are  going to emphasize to FCE that both sides need to devote their technical  resources to this goal.  One of our priorities is to bring the technical  portions of the purchase order up to the level necessary to finalize an  order.  I need the Tony Leo list today so I can show FuelCells all the  information that they owe us before this meeting.  2.  We have redrafted the purchase order.  However, the P.O. needs refinement  to reflect the resolution of the outstanding business terms and to make  certain that the technical information and procedures are clearly defined  (much of the information that I sent you).  Given 1) the proposed payment  mechanics and 2) FCE's lack of mature documents, we are concerned that FCE  will try to get by with loose technical language to avoid acceptance and  ultimately payment issues.  Also, we are concerned that once we make our  state filing that our negotiating leverage with FCE will go down. One of our  major focuses jobs between now and 11/3/00 is to make certain that the  technical sections of the P.O. are properly defined.  3.  With regard to the BOP cost estimates, I would like to get the revised  estimates no later than tomorrow.  Our current plan is to make a state filing  (CRRA will make the filing and the filing will be the source of the funding)   which clearly defines our basic assumptions in coming up with these estimates  (we will not show the complete estimates) and to show conservative ranges.   You will be given the opportunity to review and comment on the cost and  technical information provided in the filing.  A draft of the filing is to be  sent to CRRA by 11/3.  Given this approach, it is less important that we go  to the sites next week.  Our focus should be on getting the purchase order  into shape (from a technical point of view) and making sure that the state  filing is accurate as to our base technical assumptions.  4.  The state filing is expected to be made by CRRA in the subsequent week.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.","1. We want to clarify our game plan for the next couple of weeks. 1.

2022-04-15 04:31:12+00:00,true,4,"  Hi Charlotte,  I'm not sure what we are doing at Thanksgiving, but at the most we might go  to Palacios, which means that we would be gone no  more than Thursday and  maybe Friday night.  I haven't talked to Paige about her schedule yet, but I  know we need to get organized. Also, I think Michael is out of school that  Wednesday.  Again, I need to check.  More to come.  As for tomorrow (BOO), we forgot to watch for sundown.  I know, that is hard  to believe.  We will update tomorrow!  Kay       ""Brashear, Charlotte"" <cbrashear@velaw.com> on 10/30/2000 07:59:12 AM To: ""Mann Kay (E-mail)"" <kmann@enron.com> cc: ""Mann Neil (E-mail)"" <nmann@erac.com>   Subject: Michael     As usual, Michael was a delight.  We want to see Beauty and the Beast on Ice.  It's on November 22-26.  Let me know if the family is going to be out of town and if not, what date would be best.  I assume Michael is out of school Thursday-Sunday, but don't know.  I would love to get him interested in things like this.     We passed U. of H., and I told him that was where Mom went to school to learn to be a lawyer.  He informed me that he was not going to be a lawyer.  When I asked him what he did want to be, he said, ""a boss so I can tell everybody what to do.""  I explained that you could not be a boss directly out of college, but he was firm.  That's what he wants.     He's funny watching videos.  I would try to sneak in reading a book or looking over something, but he was emphatic.  He wanted me to ""watch the video at the same time he did so we could talk about things as they happened.""     Let me know about Beauty and the Beast.

2022-04-15 04:58:11+00:00,true,4,"  Here's my little bit of info:  GE (S & S) - I've spoken with Lee Johnson (commercial lead) and have traded  voice mails with Kent Shoemaker regarding the project specific turbine  contracts.  I'm requesting a meeting with them on Thursday to iron our  details.    I requested a revised draft this week (from Andrews & Kurth), but  have not received it yet.  ABB - I've swapped calls with Mike Sandrige (their commercial lead) about it,  but haven't connected.  The contract is more straight forward, so problems  are not expected.  Initial draft of the project specific contracts has been  prepared.  Blue Dog - Is that GE equipment? Sheila may have someone she wants to work on  it.  If not, I can fit it in since it relates to what I'm working on with the  GE contracts.  Austin - this is Stuart's project.

The LJM deal is  called ""Blue Dog"" and ENA has decided it wants those turbines.  Blue Dog-  Lisa has her folks talking to WLB regarding the Blue Dog contract and Rob  Taylor has contacted Winston & Strawn about a new ADA.   We will need to  contact GE about the transfer (actually it will be two transfers - one to WLB  and then into the ""Developer"" in the CSFB structure).   Who at ENA legal should I work with  to get that process started?  Both Rob  and I have the turbine purchase agreement and can get it to the ENA lawyer.     Austin -  The Austin turbines are the LMs - that purchase agreement contemplates that  the new buyer will execute another agreement with (GE/S&S) covering the  turbines it acquires.   Is that structure still contemplated?  Is there  another way to do this that would be easier from a labor perspective?   I  assume ENA will then be assigning the equipment on to the project company or  EPC contractor, also.   CSFB Structure -  More generally we will need to get buy-in from vendors on the assignment of  the purchase contracts.  Is this an appropriate topic for the the World  Hunger discussion tomorrow?  Are there other vendors who need to be contacted  on this also?

Return to Top     Joke of the Day      *** Accouting for Taste   The accountant for the law firm of Dewey, Cheatham & Howe was retiring after  working for the firm for seventeen years. Cheatham was interviewing  applicants, and was disappointed, as only three had even bothered to send in  a resume.    After looking over the application of the first, an accountant with six years  experience at Goldman Sachs, he called the first applicant in, and asked the  woman what 2 plus 2 was.    She answered, ""Four.""    Cheatham said he would call her if she was selected.    The second candidate was a CPA from Harvard, and at the end of the interview  he was asked the same question, ""What is two and two?""    The CPA replied, ""Four."" Cheatham told him that he would call the young man  if he was selected.    The third applicant was a recently-graduated philosophy. Cheatham figured  that this wasn't going to go anywhere, but thought, ""What the hey? I've got  nothing to lose.""    He interviewed the young man quickly and asked, ""I know you don't have an  accountancy background, but can you tell me what two plus two is?""    To which the philosophy major replied, ""Can you tell me what would you want  it to be?""    And was hired on the spot.

If your name appears on the report, then you are responsible  for clearing this discrepancy. You may not have been actually working during this time period,  ie,  a deal  may have been extended in scheduling under your name. However,  I am holding each person who's name appears responsible for  clearing this  issue.   If you are required to pull tapes,  come see me for  approval.  Several issues on the list have been cleared previously.   We must  communicate this info to Caroline so that she can make the appropriate  entries into the  DMS (Dispute Management System).      You may be asked to complete other  settlements discrepancies as well.  This is a huge issue,  as our trading strategies were a bit hard to follow  from Settlements viewpoint.    We need to assist this process to make sure  that Enron gets the actual money that Real Time claimed that we made.  I want everyone to understand that just because we have a discrepancy with a  customer,  I am certainly not assuming that you/we are in the wrong. In more than one half of all disputes,  we are correct.    In this case,  we  need to prove our position with tapes,  etc.   Thanks,  JMF ","Greetings- I will be passing out a report of settlements issues that have come from Volume Mgmt.

The PX cleared for zero's  much of the onpeak hours, as there was major cong. at PV.

Due to the latest version  of the trade app, the templates that we export and upload into CAPS need to  be modified prior to uploading.  The templates now contain "";;"" when they  need to have "";0;"".  So the temporary fix is to go into the template and  manually enter the 0's where they are missing.  The procedure should be as follows:  1.  export th file to A:\\ as usual  2.  save the file to O:\\ Portland\WestDesk\California Scheduling\PX Final  Schedules\Final Schedules as usual  3.  Open the file from the O:\\ drive and locate all consecutive  semi-colons.  There should be a zero between them.  The easiest way to do  this is the replace function.  In the search menu, select ""replace"".  In the  ""find what:"" boxe, place ;; and in the ""replace with:"" box type ;0;   Then  choose ""Replace all"" two times.  Save the file and you're done.  4.

Flash flooding can be a serious threat during heavy thunderstorms; if      you are at any time abruptly swept away by a raging stream or river,      be prepared to take emergency action.       If your community is threatened by a tornado, close all doors and      windows, caulk them shut, then twitch and quiver fiercely as you hope      to God you make it out of this thing alive.       When driving through heavy rain, motorists should accelerate      significantly to remove water from their windshield as fast as      possible.       Never attempt to drive through standing water if it is deeper than      your car.       Do not temp fate by golfing during a thunderstorm; in 1998 alone, over      14,000 golfers completely fucked up their favorite golf shoes by      walking on saturated greens, and another 9,200 were injured by flying      clubs whose grips had become unexpectedly slippery.       Sandstorms can occur without warning in desert climates, and present      serious blinding and choking hazards to people caught in them. If you      find yourself caught in a sandstorm, you should immediately reconsider      what hell your were doing wandering through the goddamn desert in the      first place.       While not necessarily weather phenomena, earthquakes can be powerful      and devastating. If you fear you might be living in an      earthquake-prone region, consider moving to less threatened locations,      such as Antarctica or the moon.       from: http://www.brknews.com/","Weather Safety Tips Roadways can often become icy without warning, presenting serious hazards to motorists, so you should keep snow chains on your tires at all times.

2022-04-15 13:35:45+00:00,false,6,"  Good Morning,  Over the last couple of weeks, we've made several recent additions to the  Portland IT applications team.  We hope that with this new influx of talent  we will continue to ""raise the bar"" for IT support of Enron's trading  activities in Portland.  Richard Schweiger is our new Senior Applications Specialist. He comes to  Enron through RHI Consulting where he contracted at Enron for the last 2  months and has now converted to full-time.  Richard has several years of  Visual Basic and C++ programming experience. He has been living in the  Portland, Oregon area for the past 4 years and is originally from  California.  His current projects include migration of the California  Pre-Trade application to the intranet as well as building strong middle tier  architecture to support the new CAL-Web development.  Michael Tully is our new lead Trading Floor Support analyst.  He recently  moved from Oklahoma where he was the Lead Help Desk Support for Electronic  Storage Corporation.  Mike's wife is due with their second baby in January.   Outside of work, Mike love's to scuba dive.  Mike is currently working for  Comsys and hopes to eventually convert to full-time.  Mike is replacing  Wendella Rhoads who recently moved back to Eugene to be closer to family.  Dan Maxwell is a new contract developer from Maxim consulting working on the  California Pre-Trading application.  Dan currently lives in Boise, Idaho and  commutes to Portland during the week.  Dan spent the previous year commuting  to Washington DC developing software for GEICO insurance company.  He is  originally from Miami, Florida where the beach is the place to be but  counting is a lost art.    Paul Kane has recently transferred from the IT infrastructure group to the IT  applications group to work on SQL support and development.   On a sadder note, we will be losing Winston Goodbody on December 18th to a  six month cross-country skiing trek across Wyoming.  Winston has been  contracting at Enron for the last year and a half and will be sorely missed.

2022-04-15 12:55:58+00:00,true,6,"  Hey Mark I hesitated in calling you at work but the credit collection agency said that if we didn't commit to pay something today, then they would write off the entire amount as a bad debt, which would have permanently  impacted both of our credit histories.   Apparently, they are only allowed to keep delinquent accounts for six months on their books before write-off and your last payment was end of March.     The guy on the phone said that they were calling all of Oregon to get hold of you and even called Washington Mutual and the frat house.   Someone at the frat house said you may have moved to southern california.   Then, they finally got my house by calling information after calling several other Guzman's in Orange County.  This will work out as soon as we get current on the account.    I told them to deduct $600 from my back account and he agreed to post-date the payment in two weeks.   I also explained the death in our family and he said it will not permanently hurt our credit history, other than showing we were late several months.   There is no need to write a letter and you can pay me when you get the insurance check.  My girls also fly in for the week on Sunday about 1pm.    Plan on coming over for dinner about 5:00 since we'll all be there anyway.   Let me know if you need a ride from the airport. Love ya and go beavs!

2022-04-15 08:03:07+00:00,false,6,"  Well I bet your family just feels like I was saying the other night.  That  you are to close with them to actually move.  I wish you luck and hopefully  you get a good offer but i would definetly think about needing more than just  $35,000 to live in LA. I would think the absolute minimum you should take  would be $40,000 to $45,000 plus moving costs and siging bonus.  He has been  persuing you for over a year so it appears he is pretty desperate for you  services.  In LA to get someone for that cheap is really a bargain.  You have  got to realize it s really expensive to live there.  Especially if your  office is in Beverly Hills.  You kind of have two options.  You could live in  the Valley for cheaper.  But in my opinion the Valley sucks. I would never  ever ever live in the valley.   Or you could find somewhere in like North  Hollywood or maybe Redondo Beach.  Lisa lives there (north Hollywood)  and  pays about $900 a month for a one bedroom apartment.  Which is very  reasonable for LA.  Maybe Danny has some connections.   So I am curious, if  Dave was to say I love you and don't go would you stay?","Well I bet your family just feels like I was saying the other night that you are to close up with them to actually move.

2022-04-15 09:24:32+00:00,true,6,"  Welcome to the Official PGE PARK NEWSLETTER.  This newsletter has been created by Portland Family Entertainment (PFE) to give you an insider's view on PGE PARK, the home of the Triple A Baseball Portland Beavers and A-League Soccer Portland Timbers.  For more information, please visit our web site at www.pgepark.com, or call the Ticket Hotline at (503) 553-5555.  PGE PARK CONSTRUCTION OVERVIEW When PGE Park is completed next spring, event patrons may be surprised to see the magnitude of this exciting renovation.  In partnership with the City of Portland, PFE will manage a $38.5 million renovation of the former Civic Stadium to enhance fan enjoyment standards, meet modern design codes and honor the historic character of this 1926 landmark.  Soon to be the premier outdoor event venue in the region, PGE Park will feature:  *  New convertible playing surface, adaptable to all events.  *  New baseball dugouts and bullpens.  *  Major League Baseball field dimensions.  *  Vintage style wrought-iron fence along 18th Ave. allowing passerby a view of all PGE Park events.  *  New seats and wider concourses.  *  New restrooms and baby-changing stations.  *  New concession stands and kiosks with improved menu options.  *  Fred Meyer Family Deck featuring an old-fashioned soda fountain.  *  Yet-to-be-named Widmer field level bar and grill, featuring grills and full beverage service.  *  Affordable Pavilion Boxes, Field Boxes and Club Seats for high-quality corporate entertainment.  *  State-of-the-art sound system and new theatre organ.  *  Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Compliance.  *  Current seismic code compliance.  *  ... and much more!  PGE PARK CONSTRUCTION UPDATE Virtually every area of the construction site is currently under construction.  From elevator pits and structural elements to field boxes and underground utilities, it's all coming together for our Spring 2001 opening.  The main concourse along 20th Avenue (the first base side), demolished during the Portland Rockies' season last summer, is re-emerging as a wider, lowered concourse.  Steel beams and metal decking are being placed for a major concrete pour in the near future.  This will be the most visible reconstruction element to date in the project.  Concrete has already been poured at the field level in the area of the new soon-to-be-named Widmer Bar and Grill.  This field-level area will have both an open air patio and a space built under the seating bowl for a true early 1920's bar feel.  Selecting your favorite bar stool for a view of the game is only a few months away!  We will soon be adding a Construction Update Photo Gallery to www.pgepark.com.  We will keep you posted on when this exciting feature is added.  If you would like to receive photos as an attachment, please email us at info@pgepark.com.   PFE NAMES TRIPLE-A AND SINGLE-A BASEBALL TEAMS After an outpouring of fan feedback, Portland Family Entertainment went with tradition when they announced that the Triple-A Baseball Pacific Coast League club will be called the Portland Beavers.  ""Baseball is a game deeply rooted in tradition,"" said Mike Higgins, PFE vice president and Beavers general manager, who made the announcement. ""The name and logo will also integrate well with the nostalgic look and feel that PGE Park will have when it opens next spring.""  Portland Family Entertainment also announced that it has named its Northwest League Single-A Baseball Team the Tri-City Dust Devils. Formerly the Portland Rockies, the Dust Devils will begin play in the Tri-Cities Stadium in Pasco beginning summer 2001.  PFE partnered with the Marathon Media Group of Tri-Cities to conduct a poll and contest of their radio listeners to select the team name. Respondents were able to vote on the Marathon Media web site. Richland's Rosalie Swanson was selected at random, from the many Dust Devil entries, as the grand prizewinner of two club-level season tickets for the team's inaugural season.  For information on Beavers Club Seats and Season Tickets, call 503.553.5555 or fill out our online questionnaire at http://www.pgepark.com/old_site/infoform.html.   VANCOUVER'S RICK SWEET NAMED BEAVERS MANAGER The San Diego Padres didn't have to search far to find the right guy for the job as today Vancouver, Washington resident, Rick Sweet, was named manager of the Pacific Coast League's Portland Beavers.  The Padres also announced other additions to the Beavers staff including Darrel Akerfelds as pitching coach; Roy Howell as coach, and John Maxwell as the club's trainer.  ""We felt it was important to hire a manager that had significant managerial experience,"" said Tye Waller, Padres' director, player development.  ""It was also important for us to hire someone who had ties to the local community.  That's not always an easy combination to come up with, but we clearly achieved that in hiring Rick.  Rick, Darrel and Roy have all played in the big leagues and that experience will be a tremendous asset in the development of our younger players.  In John we have a first class trainer and will do a terrific job in looking after our guys.""  Sweet has 12 seasons of experience as a minor league manager and was named Pacific Coast League manager of the year in 1994, while managing the Tucson Toros as they defeated the Portland Beavers for the PCL championship.  He joins the Portland's new Triple-A team from the Montreal Expos where he served as their minor league field coordinator for the past two years.  During the 1998 season, Sweet managed the Double-A Harrisburg Senators to the Eastern League title.  Sweet also reached the majors as a switch-hitting catcher with the Mets, Seattle Mariners and Padres.  He made his major league debut on April 8, 1978 with the Padres.  Sweet homered in his first Kingdome at-bat after joining Seattle in 1982.   CONWAY NAMED TIMBERS ASSISTANT COACH The Portland Timbers have named former player, captain, and coach, Jimmy Conway, as assistant coach for Portland's new A-League soccer club. Through an agreement between the Timbers and Oregon Youth Soccer Association (OYSA), Conway will continue to serve in his current role as OYSA's director of coaching, a position he has held since 1982.  ""Jimmy was my first choice for the position of assistant coach and I am delighted that he was available to join our staff,"" said Timbers head coach, Bobby Howe.  ""Not only is he an outstanding member of US Soccer's National Coaching Staff, but he also has a first class international playing background.  I also want to recognize and thank OYSA for their spirit of cooperation in allowing us to 'share' with them Jimmy's knowledge and experience.  I think it will be a great benefit for our professional players and Oregon's youth soccer players.""  Prior to coaching, Conway had an outstanding playing career making 20 caps for the Republic of Ireland from 1966-1977.

I could have been a cartoonist in another  life.    I am here at 35,000 feet 2,000 miles from Bankock Thailand, flying  by China,  soon to be over the Philippines and pondering our lives.  You said something  very interesting to me on the phone as I was getting on the bus to the  airport.  You said that you would love to have 6 hours on the airplane by  yourself.  I can certainly understand that.  I seem to have a l lot of that  on this trip.  I am sitting here on the plane, a little tipsy after a couple  glasses of wine, and my mind turns to you and the kids.   I wish I could be  there now to see the kids all dressed up in their costumes ready to go out  trick or treating.  I bet they look great.  As i sit here and feel a little sorry for myself then i come back to reality  and realize just how lucky we really are.  I turned to Ken Rice at the  ceremony yesterday and said, ""What is an Okie and a boy from Nebraska doing  at a Japanese barrel ceremony with Thomas Foley, former Speaker of the House,  breaking a barrel of saki in front of 300 Japanese executives and TV.  The  Prime Minister of Japan didn't show up and actually it is expected that he is  out of a job on a no confidence vote last night.  (Really bad luck for Enron  here) I would have liked to have met him.  Actually, the ceremony was neat  and I imagine that they will have some funny pictures from it.  You should  see me in a Happy coat.  I'll explain when i get home.    Can you imagine sitting in our home, right after Michael was born and even  imagining what are lives are like today?  We are so blessed.  Even more than  that, I am so blessed to have you. I was writing in my journal on the trip  over, you know my journal - that project that I have dedicated a big part of  my life to and that you have never read, reflecting on our lives and  wondering why God let me find you so many years ago.  I must have been a  priest in a former life.  Anyway, I just wanted to say I love you and there aren't any phones on this  airplane.  Thai Airlines, go figure. So I am calling you via email.  Although  I am not sure when I will get the opportunity to actually send this over the  internet.  I love you and miss you very much.  Eternally, Michael  See you soon and in time for soccer.  xxxxxooooo   ","Christine, I rarely write love notes, even when it was a daily activity. What happened to that guy?

I obviously was not able to send this to everyone I would like to invite so feel free to spread the word. Regardless, here are the details...  It's a cocktail party so the attire is business casual to semi formal. The date is Saturday, December 2nd. Entertainment will once again be provided by the band; 8th Ave. Instinct. (I will be collecting suggestions for a new name for the band :) Start showing up around 7pm - That's close to when the band will start. We're thinking more along the lines of an acoustic session this time in an effort to avoid any Grinch's a.k.a. Pigs. No cover.  *We're just asking that everyone bring a bottle of their own boos.*  We'll provide the mixers and some boos of our own.  Here is our address and directions for those of you who did not make it to the last party... 4802 SW Vacuna St., Portland.   Ph: 503-246-1700 If you're coming from Portland go South on Barbur Blvd. towards Tigard. Turn Left on to Capital Hwy.  Go up less then 3/4 of a mile (Capital Hwy. turns into 49th St.) and see 7-11 on right hand side.  Our street is 4 or 5 streets after 7-11, on the left. Turn Left on to Vacuna St.  (If you get to PCC Sylvania, you've gone too far.)  Our place is the 4th house on the right side.  I'd love to see all of you there.  We're hoping for a turn-out like our last party so again, feel welcome to bring whoever. See you then, if not sooner!

2022-04-15 20:55:32+00:00,false,6,"  Tim and Murray,  Yesterday the real-time desk experienced dropped Terminal Server (TS)  sessions which impacted their productivity. Diana and Chip contacted the  network team in Houston to assist with troubleshooting the problem. Keith  Dziadek monitored the DS3 VPN connection between Portland and Houston and has  determined that it is the dynamic fail-over within the Enron Intelligent  Network (EIN) which is causing the dropped TS sessions. This dynamic  fail-over is a good thing. Our issue is that the sensitivity of the TS  sessions is so high that the time of the dynamic fail-over on the EIN causes  them to drop while all other applications (i.e. Enpower running locally in  Portland) are not affected.  Keith is meeting with his team in Houston as well as staff from EBS today to  form an action plan. Once the action plan has been established, Keith or I  will communicate what and when it will be done to you via email.  You can reach me on my cel if you have any questions.

You are so right about the fact that you had a way better relationship with your Dad then most guys do.  I mean, look at my brother and my Dad - Jesse doesn't even call him Dad.  Why in the world would your Mom and Angela freak out on you for having human feelings?  I don't get it. And besides all that, you were the one who used to help me and basically write all that stuff for me so ""YOU CAN DO IT!!"" Tootie is doing good.  She went in on Monday to find out if the tumor was operable and found out that it is buried so deep in her brain that if they even attempted to operate on it, it would probably paralyze her whole left side.  So she goes in on Tuesday to Emanuel hospital for this high voltage radiation treatment that's supposed to zap the shit out of the tumor.  Then they'll check it in four months to see if it's shrunk.  If not, I guess they will continue with the regular radiation treatments.  I talked to her on Tuesday and she seems in really good spirits.  I'm looking forward to seeing her on Thanksgiving.  What are you doing for Thanksgiving?  Are you going home? What are you doing for the Civil War game??  If you're not going to Corvallis, do you want to watch it together somewhere?? I hope you don't have to work this weekend.  We should have dinner too - Beaches!!!  I've been craving their stuffed mushrooms and I haven't been there since the last time you and I went.

2022-04-15 04:42:46+00:00,false,6,"  Rick,    While in Tokyo, Sanjay grabbed Jeff and me regarding redoing and re-looking  at the existing LNG fuel deals for Dabhol.  The bottom line is that he  believes that the government may have issues on actually performing post  phase 2 and if we could redo the LNG contracts and allow more flexibility we  could help them, thus help ourselves.  We need to look into this and I would  like your initial opinion.  This is complex to say the least and it would  involve using the ship differently than scheduled and diverting some of the  Oman LNG to other markets with their approval.  He believes that there is  some flexibility in the shipping and Oman contracts to address these issues.   If it works we could create a long physical condition and an extra ship for  transport.  Is there an opportunity here if all the cards fall into place?  Lets discuss when I am in Dubai.  Sanjay is not going to let it go so you  need to think about who can look into this further.

I am confident that you will be  agreeable with the decision that has been approved by Tim, Jeff , Amy &  myself.  The payment will be made in the form of a lump sum that is payable in  addition to your normal compensation:  Major Holidays worked:    $500 Minor Holidays worked:     $250   The classification of the remaining holidays will be as follows:  Thanksgiving day - major  Day after - minor CHRISTMAS PARTY - major Christmas Eve - minor  Christmas Day - major New Years Eve - major New years Day - minor    If a shift touches a major holiday,  ie the night shift of Christmas eve  spills into Xmas ,  you will be paid for a major holiday. The only exception to the above rule is the 6pm to 6am shift on New Year's  Day.   This is not considered a holiday.   We think this is a more straightforward plan that provides more incentive to  those working the  holidays.   This is a policy that is new and subject to  change at any time.

Those results  validate the strategies of companies using  mergers and acquisitions  to create global giants. However, events such as  the IMF protests in  Prague and WTO protests in Seattle this year highlight  what could be  growing opposition to globalization. Politics can veer off in   unexpected directions, so it is unwise to be so committed to any one  view of  where voters and government policy are moving that you lack  contingency  plans. Utilities can minimize their risk in this  uncertain era, while at the  same time moving forward decisively.  They can use management tools such as  scenario-based planning, real  options valuation, and computer modeling -  these approaches provide  the means                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             for understanding the array of strategies available and for  defining the  significance of choosing one or the other.  Additionally, the studies show  that utilities need systems,  processes, and a culture that make them  versatile - that permit them  to nurture 'just-in-case' technologies,  products, and businesses,  spot leading indicators of change, and switch  strategies without  confusion and delay. The two reports are segments of The  Utility  Executive's Field Guide to the Future. Part 1 summarizes the  results  of a global survey of 185 decision makers in utilities,   corporations, and engineering firms in 15 countries, while Part 2  focuses on  the outlook for regulatory policy and globalization. Part  2 is based not  only on the survey results but also on 75 subsequent  interviews with utility  CEOs, power managers in large corporations,  government officials, and others  around the world. The research also  included an intensive review of economic  studies, government  reports, opinion surveys, and other sources.

2022-04-15 01:55:20+00:00,true,6,"  Whatever she's making now is not enough. Vickie Aldous went above and beyond  the call of duty, not only locating, copying and expediting the article to  me, but all within two days of my request. And it was for a good cause -  we'll be donating the proceeds from our holiday party/auction to the  Court-Appointed Special Advocates (CASA). Last year the proceeds went to  Emanuel Children's Hospital - $20,000 from auction attendees plus matching  dollars from Enron Corp. resulted in a hefty check.  I'm sorry we didn't connect while you were in Portland. I got the message on  Monday and figured it was a little too late by then. Hope the reunion went  well. I'm scrambling to be svelte and successful by my 10-year high school  reunion, which descends upon me in less than four years. I know I'll need at  least that much time, having spent four years of my life with that bunch of  overachieving Catholic girls.  I just had a surprise visit from some Ashland friends on Tuesday, replete  with an extra ticket to see Santana at the Rose Garden. What an awesome  concert! I must say I'm thoroughly enjoying city life again. But I'll need to  come to Ashland soon for a dose of good old-fashioned familiarity.  So, I guess this was the long way of saying yes, I got the article, and thank  you so much for such indispensible help.

PG&E has reported to the NRC that 65 steam generator  tubes in its  Diablo Canyon 1 nuclear unit in California were  defective but have been  plugged and pose no safety threat. The  tubes, made from a special metal  alloy, showed cracks from corrosion  and stress and were no longer in  service. The tubes are part of the  No. 2 steam generator in Diablo Canyon 1.  There are four steam  generators in each unit of the two-unit Diablo plant,  and each  generator has 3,300 tubes. The tubes carry reactor coolant from  the  reactor to the steam generators. If tubes are cracked, a small  amount  of radioactive materials could leak into the unit's steam  cycle. The NRC  limits the number of defective tubes to 15% of the  total in the steam  generator, but a nuclear unit will begin to lose  power if the total reaches  10%. Diablo 1 is in cold shutdown, but is  expected to link back up to the  transmission grid in about a week,  when it will be at about 15% capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             BP  Buys Alliance Pipeline Capacity                                                                                       ? ?  BP Amoco has been acquiring transportation capacity on the Alliance   pipeline as a prelude to shipping Arctic natural gas through Canada  to the  US market. BP's Canadian unit was not one of the original  natural gas  producers to back Alliance, the 1,900-mile?  pipeline set to transport up to  1.325 Bcf per day to Chicago from  northeastern British Columbia in two  weeks. But, over the past few  months, it has assumed the transportation  responsibilities of eight  shippers on the pipeline whose volumes total about  250 MMcf per day,  and it plans to increase that amount. Construction of one  or more  pipelines connecting those Arctic pools across Canada's far north  to  either Alliance or TransCanada PipeLines Alberta system is expected  to  take at least five years. BP says that gaining capacity on  Alliance will  eventually play into its Arctic natural gas strategy,  but in the short term  it is broadening its asset management service.

In the short  time since then Paul has developed and grown through various positions to his  current Trading and Origination role, a position of great responsibility in a  dynamic young business making aggressive inroads into the Australian market,  and far from Enron's traditional US markets.   Please join me in congratulating Paul on his appointment.   Rebecca    ",Hi Richard.

I got a good deal of response and at  Homecoming there  were many of us who stopped by the house. The current  members were very  impressed and I was told by lots of the guys that really  enjoyed hearing our  stories and memories. We can have animpact on the men  currently in the house and  help give a positive direction for them to  follow. One aspect that is on top of  my list to promote in the house is  brotherhood. Through brotherhood they can  support one another in the real  reason they are there: Education. With a strong  brotherhood they will use  each other more for help and guidance, instead of  roommates. I have begun to  raise money for a new TV in the basement, which they  can gather around,  bond, and just spend more time with one another. The amount  of money that I  have raised is still a bit short of the goal to present it  before the Civil  War game. We need your support! It is not necessary to give a  large amount  if you are unable, any amount helps toward the goal. We are greatly  thankful  for  any help you can give.

This would mean at next cargo delivery (due mid-November):  (1)  if cargo  ""off spec"" demand separate test using ""ashing"" technique (more likely to  pass) and if it passes using ""ashing"" declare on spec and arbitrate dispute  over acceptance of ""ashing"" as industry standard; (2) if cargo rejected  (either because First Gas refuses to accept ""ashing"" or because off spec even  with ""ashing"") resale cargo and force First Gas to locate alternative  supplies; dispute First Gas invoice for cost of cover.   Mike mentioned a  possible dispute over storage which could also arise with the next delivery.   This could bring us into a dispute with First Gas even if the cargo is on  spec.  Our plan is to get back to you in any event next week when you return with a  status report.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Cheers.  And congratulations on the Sooners' win.

We discussed the subjects of Enron looking at the purchase  of GATX Terminals Corporation and the hiring of an individual from GATX  Terminals.  As I mentioned earlier, I know an individual who has worked for GATX  approximately 20 years in several capacities who is interested in joining the  Enron team.  His name is Steve Denney and he resides in Chicago, IL.  He  travels each week to Houston for his current job as President of GAXT  Products Services (GPS).  Capacities within the GATX organization that Steve  has held include:  President of GATX Products Services (GPS) Executive Vice President Domestic Sales and Marking for GATX Terminals Southern Region Business Unit Manager (Texas, Louisiana, and Florida) for  GATX Terminals General Manager of Calnev Pipe Line Company (a subsidiary of GATX Terminals)  I have worked with Steve in different capacities since 1991, and think he  would be a GREAT asset to the Enron organization.  I would like to introduce  the two of you to see if there is a fit for Steve within our company.  You  expressed interest earlier today when we talked.  If you are still  interested, could you please advise me on what steps to take from here?  I appreciate your time in considering Steve as an employee and look forward  to pursuing him as an Enron team member.  Thank you, Gene x5-3515   ","Gene, thanks for the follow up.
