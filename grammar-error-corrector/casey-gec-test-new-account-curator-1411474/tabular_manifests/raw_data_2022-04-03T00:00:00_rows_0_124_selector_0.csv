2022-04-03 05:19:07+00:00,true,2,"  I am sending this e-mail message to address several issues related to the swap and to circulate a proposed confirmation for your consideration.  Before addressing the swap, however, I should note that it is not clear to me that the project team has finally decided to proceed with a swap rather than a guaranty.  If we are not, I would appreciate someone letting me know so that we can stop this process.  Comments on the Draft Schedule:   1.  Part 1(a) ""Specified Entity"":  A Specified Entity is an entity other than the parties whose actions can cause an event of default or a termination event.  The draft schedule does not contemplate a Specified Entity.  I think we should consider whether EPE and/or SCG should be a Specified Entity with respect to TBS.   2.  Part 1(b) ""Threshold Amount"": proposes $1,000,000 for TBS, which seems low given that Enron Corp. is backing it up.   3.  Part 1(h) ""Additional Event of Default"":  If we use a swap arrangement, there will be two: one for 72.5% between TBS and ECT, and one for 27.5% between TBS and a Shell entity.  If that is the case, do we want an additional event of default under which a sale by Shell of its interest in TBS could result in termination?   4.  Part 2  ""Representations"":  I think that we need someone in tax to determine whether TBS can make the representations.   5.  Part 4(d) & (e) ""Credit Support Provider"": Shell will be the credit support provider under the other swap arrangement, not this one.   6.  Part 4(g) ""Governing Law"", 4(h) ""Arbitration"": The schedule proposes Texas law with AAA arbitration to be held in Texas.  It would seem to me that we would want to use arbitration procedures that are similar to those in the gas supply agreements, with ICC arbitration, held in Miami, under New York, with joint arbitration if the same issue arises under one of the gas supply arrangements (such as the proper calculation of price).  Comment on the Proposed Confirmation:   I have reproduced the gas supply pricing provisions from the EPE Gas Supply Agreement under the ""Fixed Amount Details"" but have not done so under the ""Floating Amount Details"", which cross-references the provisions of the SCG Gas Supply Agreement, because of the length of those provisions.   Please let me know if you have any reactions to the above comments or any comments on the attached confirmation.

2022-04-03 12:47:11+00:00,true,3,"  Digital Frontiers   Calif. Says Digitally Signed Broker Contracts Are Valid  By ROSS SNEL      08/03/1999   American Banker   Page 12   Copyright (c) 1999 American Banker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    A new California law opens the door for brokerages to conduct most, if not  all, of their business in  cyberspace.   The legislation, which applies only to broker-dealers, validates brokerage  contracts that are digitally  signed.   Though Internet brokerages routinely accept trading orders on-line, most  require customers to enroll  and order account transfers by sending in paper documents. The law makes  such paperwork no  longer necessary.   Digital signatures-a derivative of data encryption technology that binds  customer identities to  documents-are seen as a way to ""legalize"" on-line exchanges of information.   The California legislation, which California Governor Gray Davis signed into  law last week, ""gives  people some certainty that these contracts are enforceable,"" said Thomas J.  Smedinghoff, a partner in  the Chicago law firm McBride Baker & Coles and a leading authority on  digital signatures.   He added, however, that the law's specific definition of a digital signature  could limit the flexibility of  its application as the technology evolves.   Certainty about the validity of digital credentials is especially important  to securities brokers, because  securities transactions are typically much bigger than merchandise  transactions on the Internet, said  Christopher Musto, a senior analyst at Gomez Advisors Inc. in Concord, Mass.   E-Trade Group Inc., the Menlo Park, Calif. on-line broker, pushed for the  California bill, bringing the  issue to the attention of state Sen. John Vasconcellos, a Democrat from San  Jose. Sen. Vasconcellos  introduced the proposal in February, and it passed the Senate July 15.   San Francisco-based Charles Schwab Corp., the leading Internet brokerage,  also offered input on  the law's definition of a digital signature, according to Sen. Vasconcellos'  chief of staff, Rand Martin.   Schwab has focused its legislative efforts more on the federal level,  however, a spokesman for the  company said. ""This action is a step in the right direction,"" the spokesman  said. ""But the real objective  would be to get national legislation that creates uniformity regarding the  use of digital signatures.""   E-Trade said in a news release that the new law would apply to its  transactions with customers in all  50 states, but the Schwab spokesman said its applicability beyond California  is ""murky.""   E-Trade did not respond to calls seeking elaboration on how it sees the law  applying across the  country.   Mr. Smedinghoff, chairman of the American Bar Association's electronic  commerce division, said the  only way the law would have broader applicability is if a broker stipulated  that a contract was  governed by the laws of California.   Legislation on digital signatures varies from state to state. For example,  Connecticut law covers only  medical records at hospitals, while Illinois makes electronic signatures  applicable to all  communications.   In 1995 California became one of the early adopters of digital signature  legislation, but that legislation  was limited to communication with government agencies.   Utah is often cited as the country's digital signature pacesetter, with a  comprehensive law that  preceded California's in 1995 and resulted in the pioneering designation of  Digital Signature Trust  Co., a Zions Bancorp. subsidiary, as a licensed certificate authority.   To bring consistency at the federal level, Sen. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.)  this year introduced two  bills addressing the issue. The Millennium Digital Commerce Act sets out to  clarify the legal status of  electronic signatures in general, while the Electronic Securities  Transaction Act focuses on the  securities industry.    http://www.americanbanker.com   Contact: http://www.americanbanker.com ","Digital Frontiers Calif.

It is an excellent Phase 1 solution which we certainly  can try to address more systematically in future developments.  We have done some initial review of the current deal flow in Houston and  London and don't expect this language to impact a high percentage of  transactions.   Based on our review of recently executed Enron transactions  we expect about 80% of total transactions will not be impacted by this  language.

Speaking of which, I was surprised to find  that they have the telephone conversation (and in this case the web site  records) control over a confirmation which has been signed by both parties.   What's the practice in your part of the world?  One alternative is to insert  the language (or something like it) that we use in financial trading which  says that we will send a written confirm, gives the counterparty a short time  (2 or 3 days) to respond and indicates that silence will be deemed  acceptance.  Would that work for your deals?  Anyway, I'm in NY today and tomorrow, back in the office on Wed.  Louise is  insistent that the GTC's be available to be uploaded this weekend.

2022-04-03 12:58:19+00:00,true,3,"  I'm looking forward to seeing you Friday night.  I'll bring along some  sailing info. but thought I'd let you know now what we've got in mind.  Dan &  Jamie are lined up so if you guys are still interested there would be 6 of  us.  We have gotten a quote for a relatively new 46' sailboat in the British  Virgin Islands for the week of Thanksgiving.  We'd fly down there on Saturday  the 20th, pick up the boat the next day and return either Saturday the 27th  or Sunday the 28th.  [The return date is still under discussion - so far we  have (i) Jamie who wants to fly Saturday so we have a day at home before  going back to work, (ii) Mark who likes to spend as much time on the boat as  possible so wants to come back Sun., and (iii) Ted who when he heard the  question said ""Let's start back Saturday and spend the night in South  Beach!""]  The charter company is the Moorings (their website is  www.moorings.com) and the specific boat we reserved is called a Moorings  463.  You can see a floor plan and photos on the web but the boat has three  separate double cabins each of which has its own bathroom.  Each day's schedule is usually pretty flexible - get up whenever (I seem to  remember Jamie getting up pretty early & making coffee), have breakfast on  the boat, decide where to go and sail off to the next island we've picked  out, maybe stopping at one or two interesting looking spots on the way, maybe  not.  Maybe stopping for lunch somewhere, maybe making sandwiches while we  sail and maybe waiting for lunch til we stop for the day.  Most days we only  actually sail for a few hours and are anchored in a little bay by 2 or 3:00  and spend the afternoon swimming (Ted's favorite), snorkeling (the masks,  etc. come with the boat), hiking on shore, exploring the coastline in the  dinghy or sitting around on the boat or beach reading, chatting, napping or  whatever (my favorite).  There's a CD player and we listen to a variety of  music - luckily Ted has so far been able to restrain his heavy metal  proclivity for the duration of the trip.  If you scuba dive there are dive  companies that will come meet the boat and take you on a dive trip - there is  at least one really good wreck dive (in 70 - 90') in the BVI.  If you want to  learn to dive, you can take the classroom and swimming pool instruction in  NYC and do your certification dives in the BVI (Dan & Jamie might be diving,  Ted & I probably won't).  Sunsets are often spectacular and signal cocktail  hour for me.  There's usually at least one restaurant on shore in most of  these anchorages where we go for dinner but the charter company stocks the  boat with food (there's a fridge, stove & bbq grill on the boat) and as you  might guess Dan and Jamie are pretty good cooks so we can always eat on board  if we don' feel like going ashore.  While no one is excluded from any  activities and everyone can participate in planning the itinerary, we don't  always do everything together, either.  Everybody usually pitches in and  shares what work (cooking, cleaning up, sailing stuff) there is, although if  only from our keen sense of self-preservation you and Ted probably wouldn't  be expected to cook.  In the past Jamie has been the only smoker and he has  invariably confined his habit to the downwind portion of the deck.  As for $,  the boat, provisioning (food on board for breakfast lunch and a  few dinners), taxes, airport transfers and a hotel room for the first night  we get there all comes to about $760 per person.  Extras include drinks (only  fair since you and Jamie won't be imbibing as much as the rest of us) and any  dinners ashore and of course the dreaded airfare.  I've tentatively got   flights for you (through the boat company) that come to $544 per person,  though if we decide to come back on Saturday that might go down.  Ted & I  usually try to see if there is some way to use frequent flyer miles but we're  not always successful.  It's such a popular week to sail we need to decide  pretty soon so we can put a deposit down - the boat is not actually reserved  until we do.  I'd better stop & send this - it's turned out to be a good bit longer than I  intended but I get carried away sometimes when I daydream about sailing!   Check out the website & let me know if you have any questions.",I'm looking forward to seeing you Friday night.

Steve Flynn has accepted a position as the Assistant Treasurer, Corporate  Finance for The Walt Disney Company, which has a centralized finance function  responsible for all funding, equity and rating agency relationships.  Steve  is one of the original members in Asia Pacific Finance Origination and has  been a strong contributor in starting up the group and we will miss him.  Mark Peterson has joined our group from ECT where he was responsible for the  mid/down stream business and oil service sector investments made by Enron  Finance Corp.  Most of these investments were made through Enserco, a joint  venture with SCF Partners, a highly respected investment fund which focuses  on the service sector.  Mark will be looking to work with many of his former  clients as they seek to expand their operations internationally and to also  develop our downstream business with a particular focus on the resource rich  areas of Southeast Asia.  Nikhil Shah has been promoted to Associate in recognition of his efforts in  building the investment portfolio of fixed income investments.

2022-04-03 13:59:15+00:00,true,3,"  well hello there brothermen and sisterwoman.  it sure seems as if a few moons have passed since we tickled the keyboard and thought about all y'all for a spell, and that is not how it ought to be.  so stop your grinnin' and drop your linen (not sure what that means but i dig it) and let us repair to the chat room.  started a new job just last week and by all means it is a Godsend. (blasphemous?)  would that i had found this school a couple of years back, as it is well-run and full of good folks.  by the latter i mean folks who are here for the long run or at least a good while, and not fresh off the boat.  perhaps the best aspect of it is a 25 hr workweek, while the most abominable is twofold:  i gots to sport a nametag and a wristwatch, and i reckon the former is the lesser evil even though it is as goofy as Bill Morris.  the only times i have voluntarily donned a watch were deb parties back in the day - got a black running watch to go with the tux and showed it off something fierce.  back in the idol-worship days of namu and ricardo and stevo.  at any rate, that is the good news and i can feel y'all waiting with bated breath for the bad stuff.  here goes:  last month had a weeklong hiking trip to the japanese alps - a big ol' hunk of honshu virtually unknown and unexplored by the japanese as they cordoned it off as an abode for their shinto psuedo-deities - planned and set off with a native lady friend guide.   on our first day of hiking she sees fit to slip off a log bridge and faceplant some two meters down onto a rock with nary a limb or digit to break the fall.  can you say ouch?   she couldn't - knocked out cold with a visibly growing pool of blood about her noggin and limbs splayed in a most unnatural Deliverance-type manner.  enter the hero rolland, you say?  well not really.  ran over there and did all the things one knows not to do to a potential head/neck injury and checked her out.  skull was not in pieces and after cleaning up the mess we discovered a smashed face instead.  had to hike back several kilometers to a hut and thence to an ambulance.  hospital revealed a broken nose, severely lacerated lips and two teeth knocked out.  poor girl, hey?  but hey - i was the one escorting leon spinks back to osaka on the train with alpine dreams in the rubbish bin.  what is the bottom line, you ask?  as always:  better her than me! that was probably more than y'all wanted to know about that, but it really spooked me  - even more than being privy to the intimate details of the condition of susan's overworked nipple.  how is that nipple, susan?  and that was a good move blowing off elizabeth for emily, y'all.  and concerning kudos, how about our basque following in my very own ubersuccesful footsteps and putting her nose to the grindstone to become a teacher?  good on you!  just the thought of it makes us want to jump for joy, get some oxygen and repeat ""oh happy day"" over and over.  and it brings us to take a moment and reflect about our various occupations and their contributions to society, which could well be graded as follows:  1. John (the Healer):  the guy actually saves lives, a tough act to top. 2. Julie (the Developer):  enables young people - aka the future - to form their little craniums and warns them against going to law school. 3. Doug (the Facilitator):  helps doctors help patients. 4. Moi (the Ambassador):  doing my part to further international understanding by means of instruction and exchanges of culture as well as bodily fluids. 5. Stevo (the Wheeler-Dealer): not really sure what he does, but a reliable and consistent contributor to the national GNP.  also sires chilluns easy on the eye, so gets an honorable mention for that. 6. Danna, Susan, Jean Helen, Yvonne (the Mamas):  doing a guten job but for the purposes of this list, y'all represent neutrality. 7.

In our world, we use the same approach used in the financial trading world.  so that silence is deemed acceptance.  That doesn't work under English law,  by the way, where silence does NOT mean acceptance.

Apart from tax  concerns, how do we structure those agreements?

Obviously, this is the  UK version and Sullivan & Cromwell are turning it into a US document.  The US  version will be governed by NY law and contain an arbitration clause.  We're  also trying to figure out how much to say about the confirmation process  since it may vary from product to product and will almost certainly be  different from the UK version.  Speaking of which, I was surprised to find  that they have the telephone conversation (and in this case the web site  records) control over a confirmation which has been signed by both parties.   What's the practice in your part of the world?  One alternative is to insert  the language (or something like it) that we use in financial trading which  says that we will send a written confirm, gives the counterparty a short time  (2 or 3 days) to respond and indicates that silence will be deemed  acceptance.  Would that work for your deals?  Anyway, I'm in NY today and tomorrow, back in the office on Wed.  Louise is  insistent that the GTC's be available to be uploaded this weekend.  I'll be  calling in periodically tomorrow and will try to get you since I'm sure you  will have issues to discuss - and now is the right time to get changes made  to the ETA if necessary.

I have changed the trade mark wording in the first clause.  This should be sufficient wording to identify third party trade marks used on the website provided that you are only using those third party trade marks in order to identify third party products and, of course, are not using them in order to trade.  In Clause 2, I have stated that the ETA and other general terms and conditions are available by writing to your head of legal.  As I have mentioned before, my preference would be for the ETA to be available to a counterparty at the time of signing the Password Application.  This would help to avoid any potential argument by a counterparty that the terms of the ETA have not been incorporated by reference at the time of signing the Password Application because the counterparty did not know what it was signing.  Nonetheless, I understand that you do not wish to do this and will rely upon the counterparty printing off the ETA prior to clicking its acceptance to it on the website.  Do you want the counterparties to also be able to get copies of the General Terms and Conditions by writing to you or should this just be restricted to the ETA?  Finally, I have incorporated changes into the disclaimer to avoid the need for the Read Only ETA.  However, it will be important to ensure that when allocating passwords on a read only basis, it is made clear to the counterparty that they cannot trade on the website and that you are entitled to terminate their access at any time immediately with or without notice. Clearly, the read only access must allow the counterparty to open and read the Legal and Privacy statement.  I look forward to receiving your comments on this.

2022-04-03 21:35:50+00:00,true,4,"  Who knows if this is true or not, but it is bizarre. __________________________________________________________ Subject: Darwinian Kharma, Very weird  (A true story from Associated Press, by Kurt Westervelt)  Stick with this.....it's worth it!  This is the strangest thing I've ever heard.  The series of events that had to have taken place in order for this to happen are astounding!  At the 1994 annual awards dinner given for Forensic Science, AAFS president Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded his audience with the legal complications of a bizarre death:  On March 23, 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head.  Mr. Opus had jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide.  He left a note to that effect indicating his despondency.  As he fell past the ninth floor his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window which killed him instantly.  Neither the shooter nor the dead man was aware that a safety net had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he planned.  ""Ordinarily,"" Dr. Mills continued, ""A person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds even though the mechanism might not be what he intended"" is still defined as committing suicide.  That Mr. Opus was shot during what would apparently have been an unsuccessful suicide attempt because of the safety net, caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands.  The room on the ninth floor where the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife.  They were arguing vigorously, and he was threatening her with a shotgun.  The man was so upset when he pulled the trigger that he completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking Mr. Opus as he passed by outside.  When someone, intending to kill person ""A,"" kills person ""B"" instead; someone is still guilty of murder.  When confronted with a murder charge the old man and his wife were both adamant; they both said they thought the shotgun was unloaded.  The old man said it was his long-standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun.  He had no intention to murder her.  Therefore, the killing of Mr. Opus appeared to be an accident; that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.  The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident.  It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother. The case now reverts back to one of murder on the part of the son.  Now comes the final twist!  Further investigation revealed that the couple's son was in fact, Ronald Opus.  He had become increasingly despondent over his failed attempt to engineer his mother's murder.  This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by the shotgun blast passing through the ninth floor window.  The son had actually murdered himself so the medical examiner closed the case and declared it a suicide.","Who knows if this is true or not, but it is bizarre. ____________________________________________ Subject: Darwinian Kharma, Very weird (A true story from the Associated Press, by Kurt Westervelt) Stick to this.....it's worth it!"

2022-04-03 23:13:11+00:00,false,5,"  Tuesday, August 17, 1999  The afternoon ezan is as if a lament.  The muezzin's voice seems fuller, more emotional, and he sings strong and slow.  (Because the electricity in my neighborhood had been off most of the day, apparently as a precaution against fire, it was the first amplified call to prayer I have heard today.)   But it is not for us he wails.  My neighborhood has been relatively untouched; some fallen masonry, an empty top floor apartment overlooking the square surrounding the Galata Tower half collapsed, debris from it partially blocking the road that circles the square.  Thousands are suspected dead in an incredible series of earthquakes, the first a possible and unfathomable 7.8 on the Richter scale, that began this morning at 3:02.  Images on the TV are horrific: a five story building off its foundation leaning against the building next to it; a warehouse, its roof collapsed, on fire; the top half of a minaret toppled; a bridge severed neatly into four parts, collapsed.  Worse yet, dozens of apartment buildings flattened into cruel piles of concrete beams and slabs, twisted steel reinforcement and rubble.  A handsome father breaks down in the arms of friends in front of one such monstrosity.  At another, a reporter shoves her microphone into a hole under a concrete beam, interviews someone trapped there, the camera then panning back to show an impossible heap of debris above.  I had trouble getting to sleep last night, which was unusual.  Ismail and I had spent a fine evening at one of our favorite outdoor caf?s, under trees whose leaves were gently tussled by a breeze coming down the Bosphorus. (Nearby was the impressive bulk of the Nusretiye Mosque, built by Sultan Mahmut the Second some 150 years ago to celebrate his victory over the corrupt Janissary  [a kind of special guard to the Sultan].)  We spoke of writing, of nationalism, about my upcoming trip to the States, about learning a new language, about a possible trip together in the winter along the coast of the Aegean Sea.  We were both particularly buoyant, with the worst of the summer heat and humidity seemingly behind us.  In retrospect, it was as if we were summing some things up, a minor period in our lives over, a new one soon to begin.  I returned home around midnight, lay in my bed mulling (absurdly) over possible problems that might arise on trips that are many weeks away.  The last time I looked at my watch it was well after 2 am.  It seemed that something woke me up other than the shaking, though I'm not sure.  It may have been dogs barking, a person yelling, or the birds. Perhaps it was simply the first gentle movements of the quake, triggering deeply imbedded memories and fears from the 1989 quake I experienced in San Francisco.  I was up out of my bed, though still half a sleep, before it got really bad.  There was a crazy mess of sounds from wood and metal, and whatever, squeaking and creaking around me.  The movement and sounds confused me at first, and I remember thinking for a moment or two that there were other people in my place, and that this was the problem.  Soon, however, there was no question what was happening.  By then I was in my hallway, where three doorways were close together.  The first moments of a serious earthquake, when you are up in a building, are as if the earth below is swelling, the building riding those swells like waves.  Then it gets awful, out of control, and it is nothing at all like the comfort of riding waves.  I felt the sickening feeling of my building being all too easily whipped around from side to side, and otherwise. Though it was dark, the ceilings, walls and floors all seemed at absurd new angles vis-a-vis each other.  The shaking was bad enough I could imagine that things might start collapsing.  From time to time I darted out of the relatively safety of the hallway, to grab my sweats, a jacket, my bag.  Soon the shaking stopped -- I heard it lasted some 45 seconds -- and then I really started racing to get outside.  I must have been soaked with adrenaline by this point, remembering to grab my Turkish dictionary, a flashlight (which unfortunately wasn't assembled -- I did that later -- and I had to root around the drawer for the batteries), some extra cash, even my camera.  The electricity stayed on for a bit, which was helpful, but was off by the time I opened my door a minute or two later.  My place is five stories up, on the top floor, and there's a veranda off to one side.  Perhaps unwisely, though I couldn't resist, I went out on it for a quick look out over the city.  It was dark except for a moving light here and there, the headlights of cars.  Something may have been burning across the Golden Horn, in the Balat neighborhood.  I could see the silhouettes of a few of the great Mosques against a sky now full of beautiful stars. Below, a car alarm had gone off, and people were yelling and shouting.  I worked my way carefully down the stairs, concerned that they may have collapsed.  I spent most of the next two or three hours with the crowd that had gathered in the relative safety of the square around the Galata Tower (though I occasionally shot a worried look up at that huge mass looming above us).  At one point I took a long walk, further up my hill, then along Istiklal Caddesi, my part of the city's main street.  Other than the electricity being out, and the people on the streets, there was little physical evidence of the earthquake.  Some masonry had fallen.  As I mentioned above, an abandoned apartment was half collapsed near my place.  I saw no one hurt. But I did saw people in their underwear, a women mumbling about Mohammed, in one hand a water bottle, the other with its palm turned up to the sky (which as I said was starry).  Some people were laughing, others were crying, most were huddled together in small groups talking quietly.  Many of the women were wearing headscarves, more than usual it seemed.  An outdoor caf? next to the tower opened and served tea and water.  I knew a few people there and, with my poor Turkish, learned that in was really bad in Izmit, sixty of so miles east of here, that even here in Istanbul a few buildings may have collapsed.  Dawn came and I returned to my apartment, slept for a few hours.   That sleep was interrupted and made fitful by what I learned later were a series of fairly significant aftershocks.  On the television, a crowd just burst into applause.  A young boy has been rescued from one collapsed building.  Except for being dusty, he appears unscathed.  As they carry him to an ambulance a reporter follows, asking him questions.  Were you scared?  ""Cok kokum [very scared]!""  He seems pleased to be back in the world, by the attention he's getting.  Then he is asked about his family.  His eyes grow wide, his face long.  ""Annem [my mother], kardesim [my sister/brother], sesleri duydum [I heard their voices]. Duydum!""  By the time they reach the ambulance, he is screaming.  ""Sesleri duydum!  Sesleri duydum!""

My lap top running out of battery, so will just refer you to the below, which was my reponse to my a note from my brother several hours ago.          * * *  Just got on line.  Surprised it was possible.  Electricity out, so probably only us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.  Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in the streets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up on solid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad construction here; many stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment half a block from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparent injuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not so lucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed had a generator and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying, men reading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in the middle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks in neighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much I learned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, which is depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.  A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs shut a door; mistook that commotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; much like after SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in my subconscious.  Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  May need it.  Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll send this to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok and worried about them worrying about me.
