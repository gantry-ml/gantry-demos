2022-04-20 21:35:00+00:00,true,1,"  John, my understanding of our deal with you to sell 51 GJ's of gas to you each day until the end of June was at the AECO daily price with no discount. The Schedule A for Sitara 838545 shows a discount of $0.06835 per GJ. If this should be 0 can you let  me and Lisa McIsaac know so the contract can be changed, if not can you contact Kate or myself when you have a break in trading or after trading has closed for the day.

2022-04-20 17:16:11+00:00,true,1,"  06/04/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL E.10 (Copyright 2001)  THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, maybe, had he not been saying the other things.  Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths. Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute.  And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth.  We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand that energy companies could create ""shortages"" whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for ""maintenance""? You bet we did. And did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature? We did not.  But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised.  Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don't.  AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn't need.  I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but never used.  We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has.  Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it!  Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get away with it! You watch!  I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any extra money.  We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we see. And we await developments, or create them.

2022-04-20 19:23:38+00:00,true,1,"  TCPL filed an application with the NEB yesterday seeking an increase in rate of return.  They are asking for a new methodology called ""After-Tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital"" which would be 7.5%.  Using the existing methodology this would translate to a return of 12.52% on 40% deemed equity in the capital structure (equity thickness).  This would equate to a return of 16.69% if the equity thickness was 30%.  Currently TCPL has a regulated return of 9.61% and 30%.  If TCPL gets what they are seeking it would result in an annualized Eastern Zone toll of CDN$1.25 (Chippawa $1.261).   The invoiced toll would be higher to recover the difference from the interim toll, currently set at $1.132.  I have a copy of the three binder application if anyone wants to see it.

2022-04-20 15:39:10+00:00,false,1,"  Mark, our contracts at Sumas (which is a U.S. border delivery point in British Columbia) are settled against the Inside F.E.R.C. Sumas Index.  Inside F.E.R.C. is now requiring that, in addition to pure trading data, we must also provide counterparty identification.  On the basis that we cannot provide that counterparty identification, both due to contractual obligations and business policies/practices, our information was excluded from the Sumas Index for the last index period.  I know, for example, in negotiating the settlement with NGX, that the provision of counterparty identification was a matter of very serious concern, particularly for Andy Zipper who manages EOL.  However, I am advised by Jon McKay that, notwithstanding these apparent contractual restrictions and business policies/practices, Houston provides counterparty identifications to Inside F.E.R.C.  The problem is that if we do not provide these counterparty identifications, our information will be excluded from the Sumas Index, which is particularly problematic with Sumas already being a relatively illiquid point.  On the other hand, if we do provide counterparty identification, we run the risk of breaching confidentiality obligations, business policies/practices and upsetting our trading counterparties.  I guess we have two alternatives, one is to continue to not disclose counterparty identifications and hope that Inside F.E.R.C. will change its view on this (although, as I mentioned, their position is that Houston provides them with that information), or provide counterparty identifications at the risk of getting offside our counterparties.  My preference would be to do the former, but I think this is a matter you may want to review with Lavo and let me know how Houston intends to proceed.  Regards, Peter","Mark, our contracts at Sumas (which is a U.S. border delivery point in British Columbia) are settled against the Inside F.E.R.C. Sumas Index.

2022-04-20 02:06:43+00:00,true,1,"   I just wanted to take a moment to personally invite each of you to participate in the e-Speak session this Thursday, May 10 at 10:00 am (CDT).  If you have questions that you'd like to submit in advance, you can do so by visiting e-Speak on the Enron homepage.  I also wanted to take this opportunity to provide you with an update on what's happening within the Program.  Since assuming my new role at the beginning of April, I've been focusing my efforts on meeting with Enron's business unit leaders, and with as many Analysts and Associates as possible.  These activities underscore my priorities in managing the Program - a very strong alignment with Enron's businesses, and frequent / informal communication.  Some of the specific items that we're focused on as a result of your feedback, and that will be communicated in coming weeks include: ? improvements to the PRC process which are in the final stages of development with the business units, ? recruiting goals and strategies for the 2001 recruiting season, ? a series of floor meetings beginning today to visit informally with participants in the Program, ? an updated social schedule that places a priority on interaction among Analysts and Associates, as well as with the business leaders of Enron.  I'm excited that Traci Warner and Ted Bland have joined our team in the Western Hemisphere to lead Recruiting and Career Development respectively.  Together, they bring almost 20 years of Enron business unit experience, and in the case of Traci - experience as an Associate in the Program.  Anna Jansson continues to do an outstanding job leading the Eastern Hemisphere Program, and has been an great source of new ideas.    When I joined Enron in 1992, there were about 25 Analysts and Associates combined, sitting in one group on the 30th floor.  Today, we have over 700 future Innovators and Leaders of Enron in offices around the world.  This Program has been, and will continue to be our most important source of new talent.  I'm very proud to have been asked to take this role, and I look forward to working with each of you.

2022-04-20 17:25:29+00:00,true,1,"  Given the experience we had pulling back our West Gate sales this past weekend and the ongoing opportunity for pull back this summer, we should reaquaint ourselves with Enron Canada's Malin deals and shrinkage obligations with the Cochrane extraction plant now owned by Williams.  ECC has longterm Kingsgate sales to ENA of 87,500 mmbtu plus fuel. Supply is from a producer pool at NIT of 67,500 mmbtu plus fuel  and at ABC of 20,000 mmbtu plus fuel (from Talisman for 10,000 mmbtu plus fuel and from Chevron for 10,000 mmbtu plus fuel on a NIT for ABC buy/sell). ECC has a firm longterm commitment to supply the Cochrane plant with 59,000 mcf each day subject to exceptions for force majeure and allowable ""Supplier Deficiency Default"" days.  ECC is paid $0.005/mcf.  Any shrinkage above this level is interruptible. In any rolling one-year period ECC is allowed 80 SDD days but has to pay a penalty for deficient volumes.  Penalty scale is as follows: Days Deficiency Penalty 0-30 $.0075/mcf 31-40 $.01/mcf 41-50 $.015/mcf 51-60 $.028/mcf 61-70 $.033/mcf 71-80 $.037/mcf >80 Triggering Event (i.e. allows the contract to be terminated or renegotiated)  As of June1, 2001 there were zero SDD days used up. Talisman and Chevron have shrinkage arrangement that have to be respected.  Their volumes are ranked first through the ABC meter ahead of ECC's.  A Force Majeure event with proper notification does not constitute a SDD day.  Implications for Trading  Approximately 9,000 mmbtu can be safely pulled back from Kingsgate without incurring a SDD day. Approximately 69,000 mmbtu can be pulled back from Kingsgate without pulling back Chevron/Talisman from ABC. Pulling back Chevron and/or Talisman requires their prior consent and Eric Ledain must first be consulted. Triggering Event absolutely must not be incurred unless specifically directed by Eric or above.  Stacey/Andrea: It is extremely important that and accurate and up to date SDD count is maintained in our ANG point balance and verified against the monthly statement from the plant that Accounting receives.  Myself, Peggy and Trading should be regularly made aware of what the count is especially at the begining of each month and when we approach a new penalty tier.

2022-04-20 23:58:02+00:00,true,1,"  At this week's NGTL TTP meeting, NGTL announced that it was planning to complete a COS study on the Alberta system.  According to NGTL, the purpose of this study is to determine whether their costs are appropriately distributed to their services.  It's likely that this will be setting the groundwork for a new rate application.  This study is currently underway by NGTL.  They will be requesting industry participation at the July 10th TTP meeting.  Discussions between NGTL and industry will occur starting the second half of August and continue until at least early October.  NGTL gave preliminary indications on the areas that will be included in the review.  They include:   Current receipt and delivery tolls  Intra-Alberta delivery  Storage  Extraction  Transfers  Assignments  Account management  NGTL went down a similar path as part of the initial Products and Pricing Application.  They had initially proposed fees for transfers, assignments, and NITs.  This was strongly opposed by industry at the time and was dropped from the application.  It appears that they are going to try again.    I will provide each of you with a copy of the hand-out from the meeting.  There is not much more detail than I have outlined here at this point.  These meetings will require a significant time commitment by Enron.  By mid-July, we need to determine (1) what level of involvement we want to have, and (2) if we want to participate, who is the best person to handle the responsibilities.  In the last negotiations, NGTL negotiated almost exclusively with CAPP on the tolling structure.  Other industry members were involved close to the end.

Specifically, beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001 and continuing for subsequent Friday post-close sessions (and post-close sessions the day before a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in effect:  (1) Contract months eligible for trading in these sessions will be expanded from the first four to the first 12 consecutive listed contract months.  (2) The sessions will be 5 minutes in duration.  (3) The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the following ticks above (below) the daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price fluctuation limits then in effect):  Crude Oil  20 ticks Heating Oil   50 ticks Unleaded Gas   50 ticks Natural Gas  50 ticks  If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207.  AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.57(""POST-CLOSE TRADING SESSION"") AND NYMEX RULE 6.57A (""END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION"")  (Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)  Rule 6.57A.  END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION  On the last trading day of the calendar week, and, in any week when an Exchange holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on the trading day preceding such midweek Exchange holiday, there shall be no post-close trading session provided on the trading floor pursuant to Rule 6.57.  Instead, on such dates, an end of week trading session (the ""End of Week Session'') shall commence on the trading floor pursuant to this rule and subsequent to the close.  Except as otherwise provided by the President or the President's designee for a particular trade date, such End of Week Session shall commence twenty (20) minutes after the close of trading in all futures contracts and shall continue for a period of [ten (10)]  * five  (5) * minutes in all energy and metals futures contracts, subject to the following conditions:  (A) Trading during the End of Week Session shall be limited to the first [four] * twelve * listed delivery months;  (B) Trades occurring during the End of Week Session for a particular contract month of a futures contract shall be executed openly and competitively at a price within the daily trading range of the applicable contract month for that futures contract * and as further expanded above the daily high and below the daily low only for the contracts listed below provided however that no such expanded trading range may exceed the price fluctuation limits in effect for the applicable contract as of the end of the RTH session:  Contract    Additional Ticks  Crude Oil    20 ticks Natural Gas    50 ticks Unleaded Gasoline   50 ticks Heating Oil    50 ticks *  (C) During the End of Week Session, Floor Members, Floor Brokers and their customers may participate in the same manner as trading occurring during the regular RTH session, except that any order submitted during the RTH session, including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders, limit orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have expired as of the end of RTH for purposes of this End of Week Session.  Accordingly, in the event that a market participant with such an expired order seeks to participate in the End of Week Session, a new order must be submitted.  (D) Prices for trades executed during the End of Week Session shall  be reported on public ticker services;  (E) Current market prices and trades executed during the End of Week Session shall not be considered in determining any settlement price; and  (F) Floor Members executing trades during the End of Week Session shall mark a line across their trading cards prior to the entry of an End of Week Session trade.    __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

2022-04-20 19:07:04+00:00,true,2,"  Bear Destroyed after Fatal Attack in Canada  Compiled by Outside Online June 6, 2001 A black bear that attacked and killed a camper in Canada's Northwest Territories was shot yesterday by wildlife officials, according to press reports.   Coroners determined that the bear shot yesterday was the same animal that mauled 18-year-old Kyle Harry on Saturday while he was camping with friends near Yellowknife. The bear had been shot by a RCMP officer at the scene of the attack on Saturday and a necropsy uncovered bullet fragments in the bear's chest that matched the type of bullet used by the officer, a wildlife official told the London Free Press.   Harry and five other teens had camped overnight on Friday before four members of the group left early on Saturday morning, the London Free Press reports. Harry and a 14-year-old girl stayed behind and saw the bear come into their campground around noon. They pulled their food inside of their tent then later made a break for a ridge after the bear approached the tent. The girl was able to escape and get to the road where she was taken to the hospital by a passing car. Harry, caught by the bear as he ascended the ridge, was found dead by officials. A report yesterday by The Outdoor Network says the bear was feeding on Harry when officials arrived.   On Sunday police and wildlife officials launched an intensive search for the animal, employing a helicopter and infrared scanner. Another bear shot on Monday was determined not be the one responsible for the attack.   On July 2 of last year, 24-year-old Canadian biathlete Mary-Beth Miller was killed by a black bear while on a training run at the Myriam Bedard Biathlon Centre near Quebec City.           <Embedded Picture (Metafile)>","A Bear Destroyed after Fatal Attack in Canada Compiled by Outside Online June 6, 2001 A black bear that attacked and killed a camper in Canada's Northwest Territories was shot yesterday by wildlife officials, according to press reports.

In order to balance to your monthly Confirmation Letter that Northern sends I  have made some changes to the spreadsheets to make it easier for both of us to identify the  cumulative imbalance by contract.  As per our phone conversation the Burdett (17378) point was sold to Golden Belt Transport, LLC,  effective 2/1/01 but, the imbalance volumes are still being placed under your OBA contract.  I am working with others here at Northern to get this corrected.  Currently I have identified that Oneok owns Northern $2,401,128.62 on all the OBA contracts  (Ellis-Woodward-Clark OBA's=$316,846.96 due NNG; Delhi Beaver OBA=$171,781.26 due Oneok; Orignial OBAs = $2,212,211.59 due NNG).  It was stated that both parties would cash-in/out the  imbalances on the Original OBA contracts, on a quarterly basis.  At this time I am requesting that we cash-in/out the Original OBA's and the Delhi Beaver OBA since, Oneok no longer operates the  point.  Please take a moment and review the volumes and dollars on the spreadsheets.  If you have any concerns please let me know but, if you are in agreement would you please let me know when  Northern can expect to receive payment.      ","Tangie, very good letter.

This is always the interesting part.  Quite frankly Bruce, it's a pretty good job market.  Basically I'm looking at two other prospects.  The first will require me to sign a 2-year contract, the second will not.  The base component with the first is going to be around $275/year.  The second is going to be around $250/year.   As far as incentive bonus goes, I'm looking at about a minimum of $450 for the first to about a max of $750.  At the second I'm looking at a min of about $350 to about a max of $900.  So over a one year period, we're looking at about $725 to $1.025M for prospect 1, and $600 To $1.15M for prospect 2.  In terms of location, both prospect 1 and 2 are in attractive locations for me.  Prospect 1 is in a VERY attractive location.  To be honest, I'm not a big buyer of Houston, so I have to factor that into the equation.  Secondly, both prospects are big, well entrenched players, so I'm pretty confident of the above numbers.  While I'm pretty excited about the prospects of being on the ""ground floor"" with Cinergy, I also have to recognize Cinergy doesn't have a P&L track record for me to assess the probability of the incentive payout.  For that reason, I think, I would require a fairly large guaranteed number the first year, while still participating in Cinergy's incentive program.  The second year I would be willing to renegotiate the guaranteed number if we had our feet underneath us and it looked like we had the room to prove ourselves and generate some serious money for the company.  Given what you guys have in mind, I honestly think I can help you achieve your goals more quickly, and with less risk.  I also think there is serious money to be made with the right team--I've seen it happen at Enron.  No matter what happens, I appreciate you taking the time.  Please also extend my thanks to everyone I had the opportunity to meet in Cincinnati.

Got back into the office today after taking two days off with Sheila and family in Fredricksburg to find a thick envelope from Mertz Ranch Company buried in my ""in box"". Did not know what to expect, had visions of Mertz mailing it back with a note saying forget it. Instead, the lease was signed and dated and had a nice note saying ""thanks"".  Go figure.  We've got a lease for four more years. Same deal, same contract as the last three years, just 6K more a year. Price remains the same this year. next year it is 2k a year per spot and we will need to add one spot. Still waiting on Chet. Would like to know who McCombs would suggest if Chet does not commit. Lease requires Mertz to spent 2k a year on protien feed. He and I can agree in writing to reduce or increase that amount with a corresponding reduction or increase in lease cost. Term is April 1, 2002 to April 1 2005; exclusive right to hunt turkey and deer, spring turkey starting the third weekend in april.  I'm pleased. Hope you are, too.

2022-04-20 18:39:20+00:00,true,3,"  Interstates Not Welcome in SoCal Territory  California's anti-bypass policy would remain firmly in place on Southern California Gas' system under a peaking service proposed by SoCal that was approved last week by a California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) judge (see Daily GPI, June 4 <d20010604e.html>), according to the sponsor of a prospective pipeline.  The peaking service was introduced to replace the controversial back-up residual load service (RLS) on the SoCal Gas system. The RLS has been challenged as an ""anti-bypass"" mechanism.  ""We were hoping for something less punitive, something that would encourage interstate pipeline construction, but this is more punitive. This will prevent any further investment in infrastructure,"" said Chadd Jones, spokesperson for Questar, which has an oil pipeline conversion project ready to go at the border. Jones said Questar, which has already started to convert a 16-inch oil line to natural gas outside California's border, is hoping the full CPUC will take a closer look and make some changes to the judge's decision. Otherwise, the converted Southern Trails line will have to stop at the border due to lack of customers.  If the new peaking service is approved as it stands, customers of an interstate line into the state, instead of paying the RLS charge for back-up service supplied by the utility, would pay the even more onerous peaking charge. The peaking charge, added onto the charges paid for space on the interstate, makes the choice of interstate transportation prohibitive. Jones said the Southern Trails line is fully subscribed from the Four Corners area to the border, but ""no one is willing to take service on the in-state portion of the line to Long Beach, for fear of having to pay peaking rates."" Customers have been interested, but the potential cost is prohibitive.  ""It's the reason no interstate pipelines have been built into SoCal Gas' territory,"" Jones said. He noted that Pacific Gas & Electric has no back-up service charge. The only interstate to penetrate California's borders, Kern River Pipeline, delivers to Bakersfield, which is outside the SoCal Gas system.  Jones said the back-up service rate is more punitive than Questar has seen anywhere else. ""Usually, if there is a peaking charge, it is based on the whole system's needs on a peak day. This is based on a single customer's peak day. It makes the rate exorbitant.""  Besides the Southern Trails project, several other proposed new interstate pipelines could be affected if the peaking service makes them uneconomic. Meanwhile, the California Energy Commission has cited the lack of in-state pipeline capacity as the major reason for natural gas price spikes at the Southern California border (see Daily GPI, June 5 <d20010605i.html>).  ",Interstates Not Welcome in SoCal Territory California's anti-bypass policy would remain firmly in place on Southern California Gas' system under a peaking service proposed by SoCal that was approved last week by a California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). The RLS has been challenged

2022-04-20 11:05:39+00:00,true,3,"  NGI's Daily Gas Price Index  published : May 24, 2001 PG&E NEG Breaks Ground on 1,048 MW Harquahala Plant  After years of planning and regulatory hurdles, PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group (PG&E NEG) began construction Monday on the Harquahala Generating Plant, a 1,048 MW natural gas-fired generating facility located approximately 70 miles west of Phoenix in the town of Tonopah, AZ (see Daily GPI, Aug. 17, 2000 <d20000817j.html>).  The $500 million project is expected to help ease the burden of the surrounding electricity markets, which are currently very tight. The company said it envisions selling power in the fast-growing, three-state market of Arizona, southern Nevada and Southern California. The plant is scheduled to be in full commercial operation by June 2003.  ""Today's (Monday) groundbreaking is an important milestone for electricity consumers in Arizona and the Southwest, as well as for the National Energy Group,"" said Tom Boren, CEO of PG&E NEG. ""Clean, efficient, affordable, electricity. That's what the Harquahala Generating Project is all about.""  The Shaw Group reported Wednesday that it has entered an agreement to provide the engineering, procurement and construction services for the project. Shaw said it will assume engineering duties immediately.  The gas supply for the plant will come from the El Paso Natural Gas sSystem, which is located near its site. The plant is also located next to major transmission lines serving the three-state area and northern Mexico. With a fuel requirement averaging about 180 MMcf/d, PG&E NEG will have firm transportation agreements and then play the markets in the West and Southeast, according to Jim Tramuto, a Houston-based manager for NEG.

2022-04-20 14:06:44+00:00,true,3,"  PG&E Eyes Backbone, Storage Expansions as Part of Gas Accord II  Overlooking for the time being its current financial position, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is eyeing in-state gas transportation and storage expansions in California to help alleviate the current strain on the system and prevent likely future curtailments during peak summer demand periods, a utility official said last week.  At a FERC technical conference on California Gas Transportation Infrastructure (Docket PL01-4), PG&E's Dan Thomas, director of products and sales for California Gas Transmission, said the utility's intrastate pipeline will hold an open season in June for 1.2 Bcf/d of ""backbone"" capacity, including 200 MMcf/d of new Redwood Path expansion capacity that will become available in July 2002.  ""The rate impact of capacity/infrastructure investments is small relative to the commodity price exposure,"" he said. PG&E intends to make its expansion plans part of Gas Accord II, another comprehensive regulatory proceeding the utility plans to begin at the California Public Utility Commission next month.  Thomas said PG&E's transmission and storage capacity is adequate to meet projected 2001 gas demands without curtailments, but the utility expects ""very high load factors through the upcoming summer and winter."" It also is expecting continued high gas prices and potential for price spikes due to those high load factors.  A large part of the problem this summer will be the smaller contribution of hydroelectric generation into the mix. The state's gas-fired generation plants will continue to be used to their fullest potential, straining the transportation system when combined with summer storage injections. Throughput will be much closer to maximum capacity this summer than last, according to Thomas. Throughput will easily exceed 3 Bcf/d during the spring, summer and fall, in contrast to last summer, in which throughput hovered around 2.6 Bcf/d.  The system will need additional firm transportation and storage capacity in the next few years, Thomas said. PG&E is expecting to add 200-500 MMcf/d of Redwood and Baja capacity and 200-400 MMcf/d of new storage withdrawal capacity in the next three to five years. The company also is planning some local transmission enhancements to improve reliability for electric generation.  ""For $100 million we could expand [the Redwood Path, from Malin, OR, south] by 500 MMcf/d, which is somewhere between 10-and-11 cents/Dth for the expansion --- the current rate is about 27 cents."" Expanding the Baja Path from the southwestern market points (connections with Kern River, Transwestern and El Paso) would be more expensive --- about $400 million to add 200 MMcf/d from Topock, AZ; expansion from Bakersfield or Daggett to the Bay Area would cost a little less.  However, the volatility associated with power generation is likely to get much worse. In the past, summer demand fluctuated about 230 MMcf/d. The forecast, however, shows summer fluctuations exceeding 450 MMcf/d. In the past, PG&E used heating degree days to forecasts its peak needs as a planning guide for capacity additions, but in the future it might be wiser to use cooling degree days during a dry summer as a planning guide to gauge capacity requirements, he said. Summer backbone throughput is expected to exceed 3 Bcf/d with a significant and growing portion represented by volatile generation demand, compared to winter backbone transmission throughput forecast at a steady 2.5 Bcf/d.  ""Maintaining a reserve margin above dry-year demands will: account for difficulty in forecasting [generation] demand; accommodate potential for supply disruptions/limitations; provide market flexibility in the use of storage; help to avoid commodity price spikes; and provide flexibility to manage daily demand fluctuations."" He also noted that the cost of providing the reserve margin is significantly less than the commodity cost increases in times of shortage.  To maintain a minimum 10% reserve margin in backbone capacity, PG&E will need to add 133 MMcf/d in 2003, 148 in 2004, 137 in 2005, 176 in 2006 and 218 MMcf/d of firm space in 2007, Thomas said.  PG&E's core load also requires additional peaking storage capacity of about 200-400 MMcf/d, which would cost $15 million to $50 million, he said. The storage expansion would depend on a $60 million installation of a new pipeline, Line 57C from the McDonald Island storage field.

I have begun preparation of a cost estimate for the above, given it is very rough and I am awaiting information from Facility Planning which should fine tune some of these numbers.  As we do not know exactly what we will plan to do at this time, this is just a best guess but gives a reference of what might be expected.  As can be seen, replacement of the mainline valves and replacement costs for the Class 3 pipe are the highest drivers.  We are still uncertain whether the valves on the launchers and receivers are rated for 1008 psig and have not been included at this time for replacement.  I will check on this while in the Gallup area.  All of the valves requiring replacment will have some salvage and reuse value for potential use on other pipeline systems in ETS that will need to be converted to being smart piggable in the future I am quite sure.  If there are other alternatives later defined in lieu of pipe replacment for class 3 pipe, this would also drive this cost down.  Anyway, it's a start.

2022-04-20 00:45:36+00:00,false,3,"  Questar Plans WY Storage Project, Pipeline Hub  Questar Pipeline launched a major pipeline expansion initiative Tuesday in conjunction with plans announced recently to move forward with the eastern portion of its Southern Trails Pipeline to California and in response to strong demand for capacity on several other downstream pipelines, particularly Kern River. Questar also said it is moving forward with plans to build the Rocky Mountain region's first high deliverability salt cavern storage operation, and will attempt to turn its existing pipeline system into a market hub.  The company is holding three open seasons, including one for the southwest Wyoming storage project, another for a northern pipeline expansion and a third for a southern mainline expansion.  ""We're moving forward with plans to make Questar Pipeline a major trading hub,"" said Questar President Keith O. Rattie during a conference call on the company's strong first quarter financial results. ""Our system already has many of the attributes of a major hub: abundant supply, multiple pipeline interconnections and abundant storage. We're moving ahead with plans to provide parking and loaning, no-notice balancing, wheeling and exchange, etc., which together will increase liquidity and facilitate trading and transportation on and between Questar and the other Rockies export pipes."" In addition, the company is expecting to add large amounts of receipt and delivery capacity at multiple points along its system.  An expansion of its northern system would provide additional deliveries to LDC affiliate Questar Gas at Wasatch Front (up to 180,000 Dth/d is expected), Kern River at Muddy Creek or Painter (potentially 110,000 Dth/d), Northwest Pipeline at South Lake (30,000 Dth/d), and Wyoming Interstate Company, Overthrust Pipeline, Colorado Interstate Gas Company and Williams Central (50,000 Dth/d deliveries and up to 200,000 Dth/d of receipts at Wamsutter). The exact size of the project will be determined after the open season, which closes May 18.  The southern system expansion will provide additional capacity from northern and southern receipt points to Kern River (ML104) at Elberta (potentially 300,000-400,000 Dth/d), TransColorado at Greasewood (40,000-60,000 Dth/d), Northwest Pipeline at Red Wash (80,000 Dth/d) and Questar Gas at the Wasatch Front. The transportation charges are as follows: reservation charge is $5.28804/Dth/month, the usage charge is $0.00267/Dth, the 100% load factor rate is $0.17652/Dth, the ACA charge is $0.00219/Dth and the fuel reimbursement charge is 0.8 %. Both projects are expected to be in service by Nov. 1, 2002.  ""There are a lot of customers that have signed up for capacity on other pipelines that are interested in getting gas supplies to those pipelines,"" said Alan Allred, vice president of business development for Questar Pipeline. ""There also are a lot of producers who are developing new supplies and are interested in getting their supplies moved. Questar Pipeline is fortunate to sit right in the middle of the Rockies in this producing area with growing production and also to be interconnected to most of the major pipelines in the West. We've seen open seasons on Kern River, Northwest Pipeline and CIG for its new pipeline (Ruby) going to California. All of that has prompted a lot of interest in moving gas across our system.  ""With the current [high] prices for gas and [strong] demand for gas, I think every available drilling rig we know of in the various basins is producing,"" he added. ""Certainly the Powder River [Basin] is producing a lot. We have the Emory coal-seam in Utah that's producing a lot of gas. There's drilling going on all around our pipeline: the Jonah area, the Mesa-Pinedale areas. And on the other end, there's a lot of demand in California."" He also noted there are multiple gas-fired power plants being constructed around Denver and in Wyoming, Utah, Nevada and in California, all of which could be served by Questar's pipeline and its new high-deliverability storage project.  Questar's Rattie said the Wyoming Salt Cavern Storage Project is expected to be ready for service in June 2004, but partial service could be ready in 2003. The project, which will be located in Uinta County, WY, will include four 3.5 Bcf salt caverns, each capable of up to 12 cycles per year. ""That is ideal for peaking power and other flexible services,"" he said. ""This will make high deliverability multi-cycle, salt-based storage available for the first time for customers connected to the long-haul pipes out of the Rockies.""  The proposed storage project near Evanston, WY, will provide firm storage service with interconnects to Questar Pipeline, Williams Pipeline-West (Kern River and Northwest Pipeline), Overthrust Pipeline and Overland Trails Pipeline. Ultimate maximum storage capability is expected to be 14 Bcf. Depending on market support, caverns will be developed on a sequential or concurrent basis. The open season for the storage project will close on June 1, 2001. To determine rates, Questar said it will evaluate the working gas quantity requested, the anticipated shipper utilization patterns and the facilities required to complete the project. It anticipates that the price of these services will be $4.00/Dth/year plus usage charges, ACA, fuel reimbursement or any other applicable charges. For a shipper cycling its storage 12 times per year, this equates to $0.333/Dth/cycle.

2022-04-20 03:07:51+00:00,false,3,"  I've been thinking through how to approach power plant site development on a scale-able model and have outlined some thoughts below.  Please review - - - we can have a group discussion next week to plan the sequence of activities and resource requirments.  Concept  Develop large and small scale propane or gas fired power plant sites along ETS pipeline corridors and EOTT terminals.    Rationale  Position ETS to capture growth in pipeline transportation services.  Position ETS or EOTT to capture natural gas liquids consumption for power generation.    Establish ETS as a major merchant of sites suitable for the development of natural gas and propane fired power plants.  Position ETS to capture the role of power plant operator.  Position ETS to capture attractive equity returns on merchant power plant sites.  Approach  Identify legal and regulatory barriers to entry in states where ETS operates pipelines and EOTT operates terminals.   Key success factors include- - Open market state regulatory policies - Competitive and open access to transmission and distribution networks - Availability of air quality permits - Ability to obtain building permits - Ability to obtain operating permits and licenses  Identify commercial barriers to entry.  Key success factors include- - Demand for new generating capacity additions (growth in power demand, capacity replacements) - Presences of competitors  - New entrants  - Recalcitrant incumbents  Develop quantitative  models to determine intrinsic merchant value of prospective sites that can be dynamically updated. - Options on spark spreads - Ancilliary services  Determine the cost associated with site development activities - Site control - Gas transportation costs from regional hubs - Power transmission costs to regional hubs - Network reinforcement costs - Cost/benefit of plant cooling media  - Once-through water cooled  - Hybrid cooling  - Air cooling - Connection costs to critical interfaces  - Pipeline/fuel terminals  - Grid  - Water  - Sewage  - Transportation (for construction crews, materials) - Cost associated with local planning gain - Cost of technical concept development - Cost of environmental analysis - Cost to determine socio-economic benefits - Cost to obtain air quality permits - Cost to obtain building permits - Cost to obtain operating licenses and permits - Cost to obtain ETS-provided operating agreements  Determine ways + means of monetising site values - Sales to the trade - Sales to private equity funds - Hold as a B-O-O option for ETS",I've been thinking through how to approach power plant site development on a scaleable model and have outlined some thoughts below.

2022-04-20 00:45:59+00:00,true,3,"  California to Get Yet Another Pipeline Expansion  The frenzied pace of pipeline expansion in the West clearly is not over yet. PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) is planning another major expansion, potentially 500 MMcf/d, with a targeted in-service date of November 2003.  The pipeline company said it is starting an open season today to accommodate the large number of shippers who requested service in its last market test for additional capacity. In December and January, the company held an open season for a 200 MMcf/d expansion and received requests for more than 2.1 Bcf/d. ""Based on the response to the open season we conducted earlier this year and the power plant construction that continues both along side and downstream of our system, we believe there is still an unmet need for new pipeline capacity in the states served by GTN,"" said Peter G. Lund, vice president of the PG&E National Energy Group, which includes the GTN system.  In January, GTN offered 200 MDth/d of firm transportation capacity for service in 2002. Two power generators, Newport Northwest LLC and Calpine, were awarded the space.  Newport is developing a 1,300 MW generating plant near Wallula, WA, and two plants of similar size at other locations in the Pacific Northwest. Calpine has several generating projects in construction or development in the Pacific Northwest and California. Calpine also announced its own major pipeline to California last week with partner Kinder Morgan. The 2002 expansion will bring the total capacity of the 612-mile GTN system to 2,900 MDth/day at its Kingsgate, BC, receipt point. NEG is requesting expedited approval of that expansion so that partial service can begin as early as next winter, with full service available by summer 2002. Lund said the size of this major expansion will depend on the customer response in the open season, but GTN anticipates adding 300 MMcf/d to 500 MMcf/d.  GTN's upstream gas transportation partner, TransCanada PipeLines, also is planning an expansion to accommodate the GTN additions. But besides GTN there are at least six other major pipeline expansions planned to serve California. Kern River has several expansions in the works. Colorado Interstate Gas is now planning to extend its proposed Ruby Pipeline across northern Nevada all the way to Sacramento. Questar has its Southern Trails pipeline to Long Beach under construction and has plans to expand its existing system and add a new storage field.  El Paso is planning a variety of projects to increase deliveries to California and enhance gas transfers within the state using the All America Pipeline it purchased last year. Transwestern has an emergency expansion on file with FERC to add 150,000 Dth/d by June 2002, but could propose a much larger expansion in the near future because it received requests for 1.3 Bcf/d of additional capacity in an open season last fall. And Kinder Morgan and Calpine announced plans last week to build a 1,160-mile pipeline to deliver 1.75-2.25 Bcf/d of gas to San Francisco by summer 2003.

CPUC ALJ Calls for Cost-Based Peaking Charge on SoCalGas  A recommended decision by a California Public Utilities Commission administrative law judge would replace the controversial Residual Load Service (RLS) tariff on Southern California Gas mainlines with a cost-based peaking service (D.00-04-060).  SoCalGas had proposed either a market-based or cost-based peaking rate in place of the RLS. ALJ Carol A. Brown rejected the market-based rates, saying the cost-based system ""is consistent with our policy of promoting economic bypass."" Opponents of SoCal's RLS rate have called it an ""anti-bypass"" tariff, saying it effectively kept new interstates out of SoCalGas territory since customers would have to pay the interstate's rates as well as SoCal's RLS charge (See Daily GPI, April 23 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010423g.html>).  The judge said ""the cost-based peaking tariff should include a customer charge computed monthly, based on the higher of either the current monthly usage or the highest monthly usage over the prior 12-month period; a Public Purpose Program (PPP) charge based on the PPP rates adopted by the Commission in Resolution G-3303; a reservation charge for transportation using noncore coincident peak demand for the calculation of the demand charge; and an Interstate Transition Cost Surcharge, collected as a separate volumetric rate, to be applied to the actual recorded, monthly, throughput.""  Also the peaking tariff ""shall: (a) be a system-wide rate; (b) customers shall balance their nominations and burns daily; (c) partial bypass customers shall not be eligible for SIC credit; and (d) the tariff shall apply on a facility-by-facility basis."" It also will be subject to review in the SoCalGas Biannual Cost Allocation Proceeding.  The judge recommended that SoCalGas file for a conforming peaking tariff within 10 days of approval of the decision. The decision must be reviewed by the full CPUC.

2022-04-20 17:48:05+00:00,true,3,"  Sempra Eyes LNG Terminal in North Baja  Throwing its hat in the ring with a number of U.S. energy giants such as El Paso Corp. and Chevron, San Diego-based Sempra Energy is pursuing a proposal for an on- or offshore liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving terminal along the Pacific coast of northern Baja somewhere in a 70-mile strip south of the U.S. border. The proposed project would be financed by a consortium that would include Mexican interests, as well as Sempra. A formal announcement about the project is expected to come later in the month, according to Sempra officials.  Both a land-based and floating terminal are being considered, according to Sempra's CEO Stephen Baum, whose company already has proposals to build a 600-MW power plant at Mexicali and a 212-mile natural gas pipeline from the Arizona-California border through northern Baja to serve power plants along the way and south of the border city of Tijuana. The estimated cost of the LNG receiving terminal is $350 million.  Mexican officials reportedly are expecting to have one or two LNG facilities built in Baja in the years to come. The strong interest in LNG among U.S. and European energy giants is prompted by natural gas price spikes in the past 12 and the prospects for prices staying at the $3.50-$4/MM-Btu level.  Baum said Sempra has concluded that the long-term prospect for gas prices staying around the $4 level is good enough to make an LNG project financially viable. A number of industry analysts are skeptical citing the risk and the siting/permitting hurdles that developers will face even in Mexico, let alone in California, as some proponents have suggested.  Because of its geographic proximity and number of successful projects permitted by the Mexican government, Sempra is expected to have a leg up on competition, and Baum and other Sempra officials are betting on that edge holding up.  Although none of the participants are still around, a part of Sempra's Southern California Gas Co. utility in the late 1970s pursued an LNG receiving terminal along the southern California coast west of Santa Barbara. That project was to bring in the equivalent of 500 MMcf/d gas in the form of LNG from Indonesia through a joint venture of affiliates of SoCalGas and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.  Even with special state legislation to streamline the permitting process for the controversial receiving terminal, the project died from lack of permitting approvals, seismic concerns and ultimately changing economics that killed the project. Utility ratepayers ultimately paid millions of dollars for the aborted project in the early 1980s. During the same period, parts of El Paso had a disastrous experience with plans to bring in LNG from Algeria and other areas to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast.

""The fact that there are several competing proposals in the legislature kind of indicates [the governor's] Memorandum of Understanding has some trouble,"" said Jerry Jordan, head of the Sacramento-based California Municipal Utilities Association. ""Certainly if there is a [Southern California] Edison settlement we would hope to get paid out of that (as would the merchant generators).""  AES received all of its final permits last week, and began construction this week on re-powering two generation units totaling 450 MW at its Huntington Beach facility in Orange County about 40 miles south of Los Angeles. Initial power supplies from the re-started and re-built units will begin in August, said Aaron Thomas, AES's San Francisco-based manager for California operations.  Separately, Calpine Corp. on Tuesday announced that initial construction of 135 MW of peaking generation capacity will begin this week next to the company's existing Gilroy power plant in Gilroy, CA, an agriculture town not far from Calpine's San Jose headquarters. Upon completion of a two-phase build-out, the Gilroy Energy Center will be a 270 MW, natural gas-fired, simple cycle peaking generation facility. Commercial operation of phase one is scheduled for September 2001. An additional three 45 MW gas turbine generators will be installed in phase two, with full build out estimated for May 2002.  No one thinks current efforts, not matter how accelerated, will avoid rolling blackouts, however.  ""There obviously is concern among some munis that they have adequate supplies, but are still asked to participate in rolling blackouts anyway (the 1 million-customers Sacramento Municipal Utility District is in that category),"" said Jordan. ""To the extent there is the possibility of bringing on emergency generators, that is being done. Everyone has done pretty much what they can do.""  Jordan noted that the public sector generators, like their private sector counterparts, need air quality restrictions waived temporarily so units that carry restricted hours of operations can be turned loose during summer peak demands to help avoid blackouts.

2022-04-20 09:18:00+00:00,true,4,"  Thanks for listening  on last week's phone call.       I have been asked to help Doug Gilbert-Smith get Ercot off of the ground as far as Services and Hourly trading is concerned.     If you have not  heard,   the Entergy and TVA cash trading positions will now be manned by one trader who will also trade the term markets.        This will give the traders the leverage needed to create value in these  respective regions.      My inexperience in the term  is the reason given for my implied demotion,   although these moves opened up cash trading opportunities for  other players.          This had been the first month that I've had  access to the prompt month and I am up nearly $500k;     there is no doubt in my mind that I was going to beat this region into a profitable proposition.  I have notified Presto that I would be joining Doug in Ercot,   but would be considering other options in Houston,  or even Portland.     I mentioned that I might call you and he has no problem with that.         The job in Houston may be a good opportunity,  however,   the environment here is not compatible with my personal and professional  goals.  I am looking for other opportunities,  preferably within the company.     If there are areas that you think might be a good match for my skill set,  let me know -   I would appreciate your consideration or suggestions.

""Connie --  Actually, they reacted very well - or at least as well as can be expected.  They were sad, but not horrified or anything.  They respect me and know that it's not a choice.  It was just so weird, because I did not have any agenda or intention on telling them that at that point, we were just talking about stuff (and drinking) and I just told them.  And I told them, you can't be totally surprised by this - and they said no.  They had questioned it before, but had not wanted to offend me by asking.  At the same time, they were holding out hope that it wasn't true.  But now they know.  They didn't really have alot of questions or anything, but were just accepting of it.  I'm very happy to have it off my chest.  Sorry to hear about your stomach!!!  That doesn't sound fun at all.  I had a pretty bad hangover yesterday, because I drank profusely before durning and after the whole outing myself to my parents ordeal.  Scott""  So, maybe you already read that.  Anyway, is Armin getting alzheimers???  I don't have any big plans for the weekend.  I actually have a couple of dates, but nothing major.  I've made a couple of new friends, so I want to continue to cultivate those sort of relationships...if other types come up that's fine, but I'm not really concentrating on it.  But I had to go out and tell a couple of my new friends about my revelation to my parents.  A couple of them have not done it themselves, so everybody's all proud of me and stuff.  It's kinda funny really.  But it's like the one thing that was always your biggest concern just isn't there anymore.  I hope it was the right thing to do, but I feel like it was.

2022-04-20 02:04:21+00:00,true,4,"  From: Governor's Office of Emergency Services  RANCHO CORDOVA - For more than 50 years, California's emergency response to earthquakes, floods, wildfires and other statewide disasters has been managed from a building that is itself vulnerable to disaster. That is about to change. Construction is nearly complete on a state-of-the-art headquarters and State Operation Center building near Sacramento. Today, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services will hold a dedication ceremony at 10 a.m. to dedicate the building. It is named for former state Senator William P. Campbell who, throughout his 22-year legislative career, strongly supported emergency management and public safety. The event will also include speeches by OES Director Dallas Jones, Sacramento County Supervisors Don Nottoli and Rodger Niello, as well as three of the eight past OES directors who served the agency between 1971 and 1998. Other honored guests in attendance include legislators. The event will be topped off by a procession of helicopters and fixed-wing airplanes, which are being provided by multiple state agencies which OES often calls upon in coordinating disaster response. They include the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, California Department of Justice, U.S. Coast Guard, California Department of Justice, California Highway Patrol, Sacramento County Sheriff's Department, Sacramento Police Department and the California National Guard. OES coordinates state-level emergency preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation for a wide range of natural and human-caused emergencies and disasters. The agency maintains the state's 24-hour 'Warning Center,' which stands at the ready to provide immediate support for local responders. OES also works hand-in-hand with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help California recover from major disasters. The desperately needed office space will allow the agency to combine its headquarters operation from seven, Sacramento-area buildings into one. All OES headquarters employees will be able to work together, under one roof for the first time in more than a decade. The existing headquarters site now holds less than half of the agency's 458 headquarters employees. The new, high-tech facility will replace the early-1950s, cinder-block headquarters in South Sacramento. It will also enable the agency to comply with more recent, stricter construction requirements mandated of 'essential services' facilities as defined in the 1968 Essential Services Building Seismic Safety Act. The act applies to the State Operations Center. The agency's headquarters will, for the first time, be located outside of a flood plain. Though no floodwater has dampened its floors, floods have closed roads leading to the headquarters and caused OES staff to prepare for evacuation several times during severe winter weather, although it was never necessary to actually evacuate. Not only will the new building unite OES sections and branches into one central location, and increase flood safety, it will provide emergency workers with a more sophisticated telecommunications system. No longer limited by the former building's outdated electrical wiring, OES' technology and telecommunications specialists have arranged for the new building to feature its own, on-site telephone service. The service will be used to maintain communications within the building if lines to telephone company switches were ever severed. Calls to outside emergency agencies would still be possible through the new system, which is capable of satellite-to-wire and satellite-to-radio transmission. Further, the new site features a generator capable of keeping the operation functioning in a power outage, and a second generator for use if the first one were to fail. 'Most buildings, if they have an emergency generator, will keep maybe a fourth of the building running,' said lead design architect Kris Barkley, vice president of Dreyfuss & Blackford Architects. 'This system is set up so that you can pretty much operate the entire building and it would be almost the same as if the power weren't off at all.' The building itself is constructed of materials meant to withstand natural disasters far greater than Sacramento has known in recorded history. The Senator William P. Campbell Emergency Services Building is made up of two parts. The west wing holds executive, planning, and disaster assistance offices, among others. The east wing is the emergency response nerve center, housing the State Operations Center, Warning Center, Law Enforcement Branch and Fire & Rescue Branch. The executive office wing is a sleek and transparent two-story structure of steel and glass with flexible open-office space to house a majority of personnel. By contrast, the operations wing - which houses the State Operations Center - has light entering primarily from skylights. The visual focus is toward the center, rather than to the outside. On the second floor, offices open to a mezzanine or wrap-around balcony which encircles and overlooks the State Operations Center, which is on the first floor below. The high, solid white ceiling has the shape of an inverted triangular prism which reflects and diffuses the sun's rays entering from bordering skylights, to naturally light the working area.  ###   For more information contact: Tom Mullins (916) 262-1843  EDIS-05-09-01 1624 PDT   --------------------------------------------------------- To update or terminate your subscription to this email service visit our webpage at http://www.incident.com/edismail.html.

2022-04-20 21:40:11+00:00,true,4,"   On Saturday, June 9, Tropical Storm Allison left Houston in chaos dumping more than 20 inches of rain and flooding the city in a matter of hours. As of Sunday night, 17 people had died in the storm and many others are still missing. One of those who perished in the fatal flood was one of our employees, a summer intern in ETS and student at Texas A & M University, Chad Garren. Our condolences go out to his family and co-workers. At this time, Enron Community Relations and Aggies@Enron <mailto:Aggies@Enron> are planning to establish a scholarship fund in his memory.  More information on the fund will be forthcoming.  Enron has made a corporate contribution of $500,000 to the American Red Cross to aid in the victim relief effort. Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.   Enron will match your contribution dollar for dollar and your donation will not be counted against your $15,000 annual limit.  Although Enron is supporting the American Red Cross, please feel free to make your donation to the non-profit organization of your choice that is offering aid to flood victims (they must provide proof of their 501c 3 status). Please send your check to EB1635a before Friday, June 15, and we will send it, along with a matching check to the appropriate agency.  On the memo line of your check, please make sure to write ""Houston Flood Relief.""    We know that many Enron employees have been severely impacted by this devastating flood. Enron cares about you and your family and would like to make sure that your immediate needs are being met. If you have been displaced because of the flood, please contact the Community Relations hotline at ext. 37181 for assistance. Also, if you would like to help your co-workers who have been displaced, an account has been set up at the Enron Federal Credit Union to accept donations. Please bring/send your contribution to the Enron Federal Credit Union and make your checks out to Employee Flood Relief .  There are many agencies in Houston in need of volunteer assistance. If you would like to volunteer, please e-mail your name and extension to communityrelations@enron.com <mailto:communityrelations@enron.com>. Please note if you are willing to lead a project.  Again, our hearts go out to Chad's family and to all of you who have been impacted by this tragedy. Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.","On Saturday, June 9, Tropical Storm Allison left Houston in chaos dumping more than 20 inches of rain and flooding the city in a matter of hours.

The Settlement: provided for the continuation of two separate RTOs in the Midwest - ARTO and  MISO - to be operational by 12/15/01 provides for a single, non-pancaked Super-Regional rate for transactions with  sources and sinks within the two- RTO Super Region provides that ARTO and MISO will negotiate with PJM to develop a joint rate  methodology includes an Inter-Regional Cooperation Agreement committing the ARTO and MISO  to develop compatible protocols and formats, share information and data,  develop a combined reservations and scheduling system, coordinate on TLRs,  and develop procedures for real-time operational disputes. allowed withdrawal of IP, ComEd and Ameren from MISO to join ARTO with an  exit fee of $60 million to cover start up costs.  Enron had filed comments opposing the settlement arguing that it failed to  resolve the issues of the Midwest market.  Enron argued the the settlement  did not provide for sufficient RTO scope, did not resolve rate pancaking,  parallel path flow, and other operational and seams issues.  The Commission's order on the settlement continues the Hebert ""incremental  approach"" to RTO's that it has exhibited in its prior RTO orders.  The Chief  Judge had certified the settlement over Enron's opposition, claiming  Enron  was asking the FERC to go beyond the scope of Order No. 2000.  Some of the  important findings in the order are summarized below.  Accepted the Alliance stakeholder process over objections of Enron and  several marketers.  Alliance will file its stakeholder plan by May 15 and  parties may raise concerns at that time.  This does seem a late filing given  that the RTO is to be operational by 12/15/01.  In the meantime, Alliance has  held three meetings, focusing on interconnection procedures and congestion  management.  They are continuing to meet with stakeholders every two weeks -  this seems better than required by this order. The Super-regional rate is not applicable to imports of generation into the  Region.  This is definitely an example of the ""incremental approach.""  The  Commission was very impressed that the Alliance and MISO represented the  largest areas ever proposed for elimination of rate pancaking.  The order did  recognize the competitive advantage this gave to generators within the Super  Region vis-a-vis those located outside the Region, but noted that absent the  settlement, transactions would incur two separate transmission rates.  Sufficiency of scope and configuration will be determined in the respective  RTO dockets.  Although the settlement provided that the scope of ARTO and  MISO were sufficient, the Commission refused to make that determination in  this order.   Note that the Alliance scope and configuration has been found  to be sufficient to comply with Order No. 2000 in the Alliance January 24,  2001 order. Enron argued the Midwest transmission grid should be under the control of a  single operator to provide for a seamless market.  The FERC finds that issue  to be premature.  This is again the ""incremental approach;""  the Commission  encourages further efforts to build on the framework of the settlement to  develop common processes and move toward an ultimate goal of a single  operational RTO for the Midwest.  This open-ended issue may provide a good  opportunity to set up a meeting with FERC staff to discuss future steps to  work toward this ultimate goal. Enron had argued that the IRCA was not a sufficient commitment to a seamless  Midwest market.  The order accepts this aspect of the settlement, but allows  that Enron and all parties can raise further concerns once coordination  proposals are filed. The Commission will not require joint energy imbalance and congestion  management mechanisms at this time.  FERC found no basis in Order No. 2000 to  find that multiple systems could not be compatible.  The order did not  address Enron's argument that the settlement should provide for a real-time  energy market, rather than just a balancing market. A market monitoring committee is to be formed which will agree upon an  independent market monitor for the Cooperating RTOs. The settlement provides for a moratorium on the transitional pricing  structure through 2004, subject to an exception for new investment..  The  FERC accepts this provision due the rate certainty it provides.    If you want a copy of the order, let me know.","The Commission issued an order on May 8, 2001 in Illinois Power Co.

Here is your Money Mail for Monday, June 4.  BUZZ AT THE BELL Stocks shuffled aimlessly Monday in quiet trading, eventually closing slightly higher across the board. Neither a healthy inflation outlook from the Federal Reserve chairman nor a bleak semiconductor sales report seemed to excite investors.  Blue chips sported the biggest gains as the Dow Jones industrial average rose a whopping 0.6 percent, gaining 71 points to 11,062. The Nasdaq Composite edged up 7 to 2,156 and the Standard & Poor's 500 climbed 6 to 1,267.  Overnight, Fed chief Alan Greenspan told a Singapore monetary-policy conference that U.S. inflation is under control, at least as far as consumers are concerned. Normally, that would be something to shout about. But Greenspan blunted any optimistic response by pointing out the reason inflation remains at bay: In order to fend off competition and keep you and me as customers, companies are accepting slimmer profit margins instead of raising prices.  Greenspan's comments inspired an early pop that quickly fizzled.  The other big piece of before-the-bell news -- the Semiconductor Industry Association's April sales report -- exerted a more lasting influence, but only on chip stocks. The SIA said chip sales slumped 4.7 percent in April from March. In response, producers of both chips and chip-making equipment lost ground. Applied Micro Devices fell more than 6 percent and Applied Materials lost about 2.5 percent. Industry giant Intel was little changed, while shares of Cypress Semiconductor actually rose, despite the company's profit warning.  Oil-related shares rose as crude prices bubbled higher, this time in response to more threats of supply disruption from Iraq. The S&P oil-drilling group climbed 2.3 percent, while the more diversified oil-and-gas group rose 1.5 percent. Triton Energy, meanwhile, surged more than 15 percent after the company announced a huge oilfield discovery off the African coast.  More broadly, about two-thirds of S&P industry groups tallied gains, although nothing moved particularly fast or far.

Here is your Money Mail for Thursday, June 7.  BUZZ AT THE BELL The vagaries of semiconductor supply and demand once again drove stock trading -- this time to the delight of chip-stock investors. Thanks to a positive profit spin from National Semiconductor, stocks of companies that make chips and chip equipment soared.  The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.1 percent, climbing 46 to 2,264. The Dow Jones industrials and Standard & Poor's 500 closed fractionally higher.  But shares in the semiconductor sector jumped more than 6 percent after National Semi, despite reporting a quarterly loss, projected better sales in the months ahead. The chip maker pointed out that its clients' semiconductor inventories have plummeted, suggesting they'll need to bump up their orders sometime soon. National Semi shares surged 11 percent to 31.04, while sector heavyweight Intel climbed 4.5 percent and Applied Micro Devices rose 6.7 percent.  Chip makers' gains spread cheer to other corners of the technology arena. Computer networkers jumped 5 percent, propelled by a 5.1-percent gain in Cisco shares, and makers of electronic instruments rose 3.3 percent.  About half of S&P industry groups advanced. Among the biggest decliners were tobacco stocks, defense contractors and photo-imaging companies. Shares of the most widely held companies generally rose, except for modest declines in International Business Machines, AOL TimeWarner, and Citigroup. Overall trading volume was light.

2022-04-20 02:43:23+00:00,true,4,"  Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park 8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001  sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON  Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of  a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village,  captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric  toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing  human being.   AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre  performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the  people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the  seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are  available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at  713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied  seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)  Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person)  are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of  performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre  ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.    About Coppelia Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de  L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o  Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving  as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early  nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the  turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet,  critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as  follows: ""Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score.  But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its  historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's  prologue."" Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a  staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius),  and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet  ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet  premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking  d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would  be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking  new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and  musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater  stage.""    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992) Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the  second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on  display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the  rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the  eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a  pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with  a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a  trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the  back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the  costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully  picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.","The Houston Ballet offers free performances of Copp,lia at the Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park, 8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001, sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON.

We dined at A?mann's, of course..our favorite place.  London was great!  I took my Goretex jacket and it rained about every 15 mins or so most everyday, but it wasn't too cold so that was no problem.  We were shocked at how expensive all the tourist stuff was...30 DM per person to go to the Aquarium!  Everything was like that, but we did all that we had time for.  The riots on May 1st made us detour a little bit, so that we didn't get to see the Crown Jewels, next time we will make that 1st on the list.  We really enjoyed the parks, the pubs and Heather's company.  But we aren't city people, we where ready to get out of the hustle and bustle and come home to our boring little lives.  I loved the fish and chips that we got at The Bag of Nails Pub, other than Pubs we mostly ate italian.  It was cool seeing the Windsor Castle and all the old stuff.  Heather has a nice flat, with a great location, right by Buckingham palace.  She's having a blast there!  I would like to see the countryside next time.  Yeah, it's going to be awhile before you are more than ""just ok"".  I am very sorry.  It's good that you are keeping busy.  so what are you going to do about your job?  I can honestly say I am happier in this job than I've ever been...but the boss can be a little difficult sometimes!!!  Gotta go for lunch! Write me!

Here is your Money Mail for Wednesday, June 6.  BUZZ AT THE BELL A day after upbeat profit forecasts lifted stocks, a couple of earnings warnings knocked them back down. J.P. Morgan Chase and Hewlett-Packard -- two members of the Dow Jones industrials -- both projected difficult business conditions in the quarters ahead.  J.P Morgan Chase fell 3.4 percent after warning of lower trading revenue, and H-P shares dipped 4.5 percent after the company said the global technology slowdown could persist for some time. Other financial and computer stocks fell in sympathy.  Their losses helped drag the Dow down 106, or 0.9 percent, to 11,070. More broadly, the Nasdaq Composite fell 16 to 2,218 and the Standard & Poor's 500 slipped 14 to 1,270.  Energy stocks lost ground thanks to news that U.S. inventories of crude oil and gasoline rose sharply in the latest week. The weekly update from the American Petroleum Institute showed a 3.4-million-barrel increase in crude stocks and led prices of both gas and oil lower.  Exxon-Mobil shares fell 2.3 percent to 89.40, accounting for about 13 Dow index points. Oil drillers, natural-gas producers and refiners all saw their share prices decline.  Fewer than a third of S&P industry groups posted gains Wednesday, and those that rose generally advanced 2 percent or less. Health care companies, defense stocks, consumer-products makers and electronics retailers did best.

It was made as a preschedule tag, but due to the lateness of it, BPA may deny it just because they can.  If that happens, EPMI real-time will have to make a real-time tag.  You can use my tag as a template.  Late breaking news - my tag went undelivered due to communication failure at PGE, so I faxed the tag to all the counterparties.  Mirant has made tag #5673 for the IPCO to NP15 path.    All counterparties have been called as of 15:30 and are aware that these schedules are going real-time - that is, their real time groups will call the schedules in to BPA.  EPMI real-time will have to make sure this gets done with a reminder phone call to our counterparties.  I have spoken with PGE/Donna, AEP/Peggy, Mirant/Emily, and IPCO/Perry.  CAES (Conagra) had already gone home for the day and has no real-time.  Any questions?  Please call.

Here is your Money Mail for Tuesday, June 5.  BUZZ AT THE BELL Optimistic profit reports powered technology shares Tuesday, carrying a broad swath of the stock market higher. Upbeat news from chip maker Xilinx, software company Comverse Technology and even telecom-equipment pariah Lucent inspired the kind of Nasdaq euphoria rarely seen in recent months.  Near day's end, the Nasdaq Composite stood 3.6 percent higher, up 78 to 2,233. Blue chips rose less markedly but still put on a good show. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 114 to 11,176, largely on the strength of its technology components (Microsoft and IBM both jumped more than 2.5 percent). More broadly, the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 16 to 1,284.  Chip stocks and computer networkers stole the show.  Xilinx climbed 9.7 percent after the company affirmed its earlier profit forecasts and said order cancellations were slowing. Other makers of chips and related equipment also rose strongly. Intel climbed 4.3 percent, Advanced Micro Devices rose 4.7 percent and KLA Tencor advanced 7.2 percent. Many of these stocks were rebounding from big declines Monday sparked by a worrisome April chip-sales report.  Lucent shares surged 6 percent to 8.48 after the company forecast improving quarterly sales figures. More than 20 million shares of Lucent changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, making it the day's most active NYSE-listed stock. Other makers of telecom components and network equipment fared similarly. Cisco rose 9.2 percent, Cabletron Systems climbed 8.1 percent and Juniper Networks rose 4.8 percent.  Among the most widely held names, only a handul of stocks lost ground. Pfizer, Walt Disney and CNBC parent General Electric tallied modest declines, while most other widely recognized companies enjoyed gains.  More broadly, utilities, construction companies, photo-imaging stocks and tobacco were among a small group of S&P sectors posting losses on the day.

This fee applies whether you are the aggressor or receiver of a trade.  3. This fee applies each time you make a trade on Bloomberg   i.e. $15 per hit or lift, regardless of volume  4. When you extend a Bloomberg deal in Deal Entry, account for each separate trade accordingly  by adding $15 to any existing broker fee.   ****** 5. Because this fee is FLAT, select the ""FLAT"" button to the right of the broker fee. *****  6. And most importantly, make a note in the ""BROKER"" box that the broker is in fact Bloomberg.  I know that many of you were never notified of the Bloomberg fee structure, but going forward we should see every trade done on Bloomberg showing up in the system as having been done with Bloomberg. The Confirms group in Houston has compiled a weighty list of ""missing"" hourly trades since the advent of Real Time Bloomberg trading. I believe these are all in the system, but possibly short a broker name and fee. This, going forward, should no longer be a problem.

I am talking with Wolfe and Tim,  but I would like to keep things low key.

I have given this some thought and believe that taking the Real Time position would not be a good move for me, given the atmosphere here.

But our stock price is not so great right now.  There was an ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE article about Enron in Bloomberg Markets magazine.  It basically said we were a house of cards and lied about all our earnings expectations from new businesses.  It was very unflattering.  That came out yesterday, I think.  If I could find it in an electronic format, I'd send it to you, but I only have it on paper....  Enjoy your sun!  It's been pretty rainy and nasty here the last few days, but that's good for the yard.  Don't forget that my birthday is Friday!

2022-04-20 17:10:46+00:00,true,4,"   Bart, que paso,   juaro?     Jeff passed on your e-mail.   Too bad about the beetles.   Is that the Taylor High School Mascot?   ""Taylor,  home of the fighting beetles,""....  Go beetles! I think you are right about Ercot being difficult to set up,  but it just reemphasizes the need for you;    they need an organizer and this situation fits your strengths. Well,  enough about you,  let's talk about me.............. the Entergy gig was made more difficult,  as I received NO training in cash trading.     After a couple of months,  a coworker took me in and gave me some pointers on hedging,  which is especially important in my region.   The month of May was very profitable,  finally,  and things were coming together until..........  (Please keep this confidential) Presto called me in to tell me that I was moving to Ercot as Manager of the Real Time group,  his decision being final,  no negotiations.  (thanks for your understanding, bunghole). I had previously turned down several attempts to bring me back to Texas in this capacity and I expressed that I was less than happy with his decision. I think that Ercot will be busy and a worthwhile region to be involved with,  given that we have retail load to service,  etc.   However,   thats not the job that I agreed to move 3000 miles for.   I suspect other changes would ensue,  once I established this region.  So.     It looks like I will be returning to Portland.    We bought a new house here and are very happy with everything,  except my job (which is a huge thing). I may be working West Mid Mkt SW or doing something with the Service Desk.    I dont mind doing anything as long as it's productive.      Anyway,  I was pissed in the beginning,  but I had to take time to digest this,  analyze the opportunity and make an informed unemotional decision.    I am too deep in the (out of the money)   options to cut and run,  so it now boils down to where do I want to live.   There is interest outside of the company  in me,  but I am under contract.    I miss Portland and I think about it all the time.     I must be a mountain man at heart.  Well,  let me know if you have any thoughts on the above.   Once again,   I dont wish to have this get out to anyone on the West desk,  just yet. I heard that you did really well on your home sale.    That's awesome.    Maybe I can buy back my house and my boat.  (just kidding). I am actually more concerned about buying another boat than I am a house.   How is your housing in Taylor? I miss the beer in PDX, boating and the winter bowling.   It is freaking hot here in Texas!  Anyway,  keep kicking butt and keep those Texans in line!     JMF    ","Bart, que paso, juaro?

2022-04-20 10:30:31+00:00,true,4,"  On May 15, 2001, National Grid filed a petition for declatory order in Docket  No. EL01-80 asking the FERC to find that it is not a ""market participant""  with respect to the ARTO region in order that it can seek to become the  Managing Member of the Alliance RTO.  The filing was noticed and  comments/protests are due June 14, 2001.  National Grid, a company that operates in New England, claims that it retains  only insignificant generation assets and wholesale marketing operations in  regions remote from the Alliance region (i.e. New England and New York after  the NIMO merger is completed).  It has minor ""last resort"" sales obligations  which they expect to terminate by 2005.  National Grid will not be providing  ancillary services to the ARTO region.

Tomorrow is a holiday...don#t know what holiday but some kind...so I think I will open a bottle of wine for the boss and me, it's 6:30 pm and we can sleep late...maybe to even 8 in the morning!

2022-04-20 15:23:31+00:00,true,4,"   Congrats to you and your wife on your new arrival.     Hope she's a good sleeper.      Now at least you can field some different questions,  ""how is the baby?""   versus ""where is the baby?"" But,  as Kim used to say,  ""enough about you,   let's talk about me.""   I spoke with Tim B again and he is agreeable to the idea of my return.    He mentioned that West has needs in Services,  Middle Mkt - SW and even Structuring.    I think that I would be a good fit in Mid Mkt,  as I could build upon my experience  and also learn as much of the structuring side as  possible.     Wherever I go,  I am ready to make an impact.   The HR department here in Houston wants me to entertain other opportunities within Houston and they have brought some things before me today.    I had also considered staying and building the Ercot business here,  as there is a huge need for leadership in this area.    However,   Real Time roles are very hard to shed around here and I am apprehensive about being a Commercial Director managing Real Time.   I have no doubt that I could make a huge difference here,  but a lot of time would have to be wasted defending the group and myself.     Anyway,  I wish we could sit down, have a beer and discuss,  but that's probably not practical.     Belden says to talk with you about the needs of the floor and get some idea where the ideal fit might be.         I know that you are out of the office,  but give me an e-mail when you get a chance.

2022-04-20 14:13:48+00:00,true,4,"  FYI if you haven't already heard...........A quick update on PJM:  1) GPU: The PA PUC ruled in favor of the First Energy merger, but deferred a rate increase.  Collaberative meeting are supposed to be taking place over the next month, but Enron's regulatory view is that a setlement will not be able to be reached.  The question is if First Energy is still interested in persuing the merger if a rate increase does not occur.  If the merger does not occur, I think this increases our chances of a deal to mitigate GPU's risk, if we can work out the credit issues.  GPU will probably be stalling most activity until a definitive answer is announced.  The NJ BPU will determine its verdict on the merger Jun 29.  2) PPL's (regulated) RFP is due tomorrow.  Enron will not be quoting, given the fact that the size is HUGE.......46,260,000 PV'd MWH, ancillary and ICAP requirements.  I believe PPL (unreg) will be quoting on a this, and are talking ot them about taking them out of some of the energy risk, leaving them more merchant MW. Also , the quotes are due tomorrow, but must be held open until July 16 (what a deal!).  3) NJ Board of Public Utilities (BPU) is looking to hold a joint competitive bid of energy and capacity to all default suppliers.  This is expected to be 18,000MW, which includes the load of PSEG, GPU NJ, and Connectiv NJ.  The BPU will be reviewing the proposals Aug 1.  I will be out of the office Wed- Fri, seeing Exelon, GPU, PPL, and UGI.

LOOKING FORWARD Our Take: Bullish In Choppy Seas  Economic and Market Outlook:  Indicators point in both directions. The economy is still sluggish and the industries are still in pain. Though recovery in the overall economy is still blurred, recovery in some sectors seems on its way. The stock market turned around after the April 4 debacle, but showed considerable hesitation to move up last month. It took a step back for every step forward. The Nasdaq slipped 0.27% for the month of May; the Dow showed some strength, rising 1.6% in May.  Though the bullish trend is back and we can expect to see the markets rising further in the next few months, the seas are choppy and frictional factors will continue to pose hurdles in the upswing. A heartening fact is that in April, $21 billion was invested in mutual funds as compared to a net withdrawal of $20.6 billion in March. Further, the IPO market is finally looking up and investors are treating the new issues fairly well.

LAST WEEK  Economic and Market Update:  The markets edged up still further this week, though the gains were not impressive. More bad news flooded the market and investors were hesitant to sell.  The oil and biotech sectors were strong; the chip sector turned in a depressed performance before shifting gears on Thursday. Guidance from Intel Corp. (INTC) and Applied Micro Devices (AMD) that earnings will be in line with previous expectations infused the markets with enthusiasm. Intel guidance: http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?story_id=11865  On the economic front, initial jobless claims for the week rose to 432,000, the highest since 1992 and productivity declined 1.2% for the first quarter, more than the expected 0.8% decline. This was the first fall in total worker output per hour since 1993. Unit labor costs, an important gauge of inflation, rose 6.3%.  Fed chief Alan Greenspan has repeatedly stressed the importance of productivity in the U.S. economy to contain inflation and spur growth, and the economic data this week dimmed the optimism. However, in a speech in Singapore, Greenspan reiterated that inflation was not an issue and that the rise in crude oil prices was temporary. Jobless Claims: http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?story_id=11859 Productivity: http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?story_id=11799  Spirits were dampened further when Federal Reserve Governor Meyer stated that he expects the economy to be sluggish into the second half of the year. His view echoed the statement by Fed Bank of Richmond President Alfred Broaddus, that the economy may have not yet have hit the bottom and more rate cuts may be necessary to prevent a recession.  News at the industry level also did not look good. IDC reported that it expects U.S. PC shipments to decline 6.3% in 2001, the first annual decline ever. The Semiconductor Industry Association said that chip sales could fall 14% this year. Further, they felt that PC and chip sales are expected to be anemic even in 2002.

LOOKING FORWARD Our Take: Waiting Period  Economic and Market Outlook:  Two months of upswing and hesitation has crept back into the markets.  Analysts are busy downgrading sectors and stocks, stating that prices have risen too much - unsupported by the fundamentals. It is true that  industry problems are too deep rooted to be miraculously solved overnight.  The markets' rise is more likely due to a change in investor sentiment - an attitude of ""enough is enough"" - rather than an elimination of the problems.  However, it is also true that recovery is on its way. Inventories are  improving and  rate cuts are  spurring consumer spending. The production lines will start rolling again. The only hitch is a lengthy wait for consumer demand to translate into capital spending and a resolution of  overcapacity. The Fed is doing its best: patience is the name of the game. Till then, volatility in the market is inevitable.  Economic data expected next week includes factory orders, construction spending, NAPM services index, wholesale inventories and consumer credit.  Economic Calendar: http://www.123jump.com/econ_cal_live.htm  Earnings Outlook:  There is still a month before earnings season, but warnings season has begun. If the latest warnings are any sample of what has yet to come, investors have a right to be wary.

LAST WEEK  Economic and Market Update:  Following a lackluster Friday, even the Memorial Day holiday weekend  couldn't revitalize the bulls. Stocks headed steadily downward until Tuesday evening, troubled by earnings warnings, analyst downgrades and acquisition news. Tech stocks were worst hit. Wednesday was, however, a different story - investors flocked back to the stock market to buy anything from tech to Old Economy.  Networking, semiconductor, fiber-optic, software and Internet stocks were hurt most in the tech sector. Other sectors that took a beating were utilities, biotech, retail and finance. Sectors that showed strength for the first half of the week included drug, medical, insurance, chemical and paper stocks.  On the economic front, consumer confidence rose to 115.5 in May from a revised 109.9 in April. Aggressive rate cuts by the Fed and renewed strength in the stock markets have boosted the spirits of consumers. This infused hope that consumer spending may rebound.  Personal income and spending figures showed that U.S. personal spending rose faster than income. Income rose 0.3%, while spending rose 0.4% in April, in synch with analyst estimates. Weekly jobless claims rose yet again - to 419,000 last week from 407,000 the prior week.

2022-04-20 05:35:02+00:00,true,4,"  To whom it may concern:  My name is Craig Carmichael.  I am a PhD student at Iowa State University, working under Dr. Bartlett in the Adaptive Computing Lab. Please lend me your attention for a brief moment.  Enron's team of power traders is the first contact I have made in this nature.  I strongly believe that I have developed technology that can make Enron millions in the very near-term future.  If you are a power trader whose success is proportional to the accuracy of your load forecasts, then I believe I can deliver an enormous opportunity to Enron and you.  If I am way off base on my assessment, please let me know and I will go somewhere else.  I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO DISCREDIT MY BELIEFS.  Here are some of my credentials, so that you can verify that it might be promising to read the remainder of this email.   1.  Finishing up ISU PhD work this summer.  2.  Invented multiple neural network methods and inductive learning techniques.  2.  Recently DEVELOPED THE MOST ACCURATE electric load models in the Chicago area for ComEd.  3.  Saved ComEd millions of $ over the last couple years because of this.  4.  Can verify the above claims and that I did this single-handedly.  5.  Wrote the new inductive learning algorithm for New Energy Associates in Atlanta.  6.  My software will be the new learning engine of NEA's NOSTRADAMUS future v5.0  7.  Can verify that I single-handedly wrote NOSTRADAMUS's new training engine (not yet released)  8.  Am the world's best electric load forecaster using advanced inductive learning methods.  This is the situation:   I am giving my Final Defense on July 16th in areas of advanced forecasting methods.  In 1999, I developed highly advanced neural network models for Commonwealth Edison, under Robert Abboud (working at ComEd) through the Adaptive Computing Lab at Iowa State University.  The models were the most accurate available.  At the time, ComEd was using the EPRI models, NEA's Nostradamus, Tesla, and the ISU models (those that I developed).  Still, I knew of many ways for improvement and have been waiting for my graduation to release this technology.  Preliminary studies show that my most recent work is more accurate than anything that is available at any price.   Since I have felt oppressed by the system (being a student), I have awaited graduation (am finished mid-July) to unleash the technology that I have developed outside of the university (my funding comes from the Meteorology department and has nothing to do with load forecasting). This is unpublished, provocative, state-of-the-art stuff that can smoke even the multi-million dollar EPRI models, and only I know how they work.  The technology could also put Tesla out of business.  The errors appear to be LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE OF NOSTRADAMUS.  John Snead from Tesla knows me and feared my models so much that he tried to merge his company with RGA Labs.  Robert Abboud from ComEd, Excelon (and now RGA Labs) knows who I am.  Rick Hunt, the project manager from New Energy Associates does also, since I wrote the software for their yet-to-be-released inductive learning engine.  Ok.  Here are the possibilities.   1.  I am making all of this up and did't really invent leading forecasting technology  2.  I am a nut who doesn't even know what he's talking about  3.  This guy couldn't possibly do this sort of thing on his own clock all by himself  4.  Maybe there's something to what this guy is saying.  We might as well send him a data set to test his claims.   I feel that someone will continue to try to take advantage of me if I don't act now.  Within the next 6 months, someone will probably own my technology besides myself.  I want to prove that I can be an immense asset to Enron.  I would like to sell my technology to Enron as part of your in-house modeling efforts.  Someone else might come along and try to make the same claims that I am making.  They might razzle-dazzle you with their marketing sense and ability to sell you their gem.  What I am saying is that if you give me a chance to show you what I can do, if you care about accuracy and not razzle-dazzle, then I will not disappoint you.  Give a data set to me and a thousand other people and companies.  Let me show you that I'm not making all of this up.  I will show you flaws in other ""gems"".  I hope this email wasn't too long.  My family & I, as of now, have a fairly uncertain financial future (until I enter the workforce and have a fairly cushy job).  Because of this, I am obligated to see what opportunities exist with my intellectual property.  If I fail in convincing Enron that I have a gold mine in my possession, then I will go to the #2 spot on my list, and will offer to provide them with the leading forecasting package available today.  In some way, shape or form, in this scenario my software will then compete with Enron.  Thank you for lending me your ear.  I hope you don't think I'm a lunatic for sending you this lengthy email.

2022-04-20 05:40:36+00:00,true,4,"  Hi everyone,  Thank you very much for the valuable business insight and active feedback on position manager during the past week. Based on the feedback from everyone we have made lot of changes in the new version of the application, which was released last week and I think the system is working to everybody's satisfaction. I would like to take this oppurtunity to sum up the features and options built inside the new position manager.   1. All the west regions and basis have been rolled out. 2. A feature has been added to the basis screen, which enables traders to paste the basis       points from excel. 3. New curve types Capacity and Volatility Smiles are included. 4. Positions can be viewed by both MWH and MW. 5. Positions can be viewed by Delivery Points.  Currently we are working on fixing some problems in getting the curve shift and hopefully we will roll that out by the end of this week. We are also planning to add this application to the Enpower Launch Pad, which will make migration easier. I have noted down all the enhancement requests and we will try to get all those addressed in the next release.  Finally I would like to thank everyone on behalf of the entire risk team for devoting some time everyday to test this application. We are striving hard to end this and migrate this application to production in the near future.  If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to call any of us listed below  Arun Balasundaram (713-853-7102) Sivakumar Govindasamy (713-345-7926) Norman Lee (713-853-6976)  Thanks  - Arun","Hi everyone, Thank you very much for the valuable business insight and active feedback on position manager during the past week.

2022-04-20 07:27:27+00:00,true,4,"  Hi, Tebby: Thought I'd send a reminder about getting number/etc. for Teas nursery owner from woman who knows him--when it's convenient.  Had a message from Daddy which he left at 10:00 a.m yesterday, saying he was getting ready to take Dorothy to the emergency room as her tremors were so bad. He said he was calling Pres, too, but wouldn't call Sheryl. Made me think she might be in really bad shape, so I called him immediately after I got home and found his message. They were back at home and she was sleeping. Decided not to stay at hospital as all her signs were normal. Anyway, during our conversation he said he wished I were there, and I wish I were too as I know I could provide moral support if nothing more. That got me to thinking about trying to fly down after all in time for Anthony's and Candice's graduations. Don't know if it will work but am going to check flights. The biggest hang-up could be work on the house. Guess I could postpone it until I get back. I would come for only a week--maybe June 2 or 3 through June 8 or 9 or 10. Just tossing it out as a possibility as I'd love to see both ""kids"" graduate, and also give Daddy a little help. Maybe Mother would fly back with me. She's waiting to have surgery on both hands, though, so...  I did call Macy's in Manchester about mattresses and theirs are MUCH cheaper than Mattress Discounters. Queen size like the one you and I had in Houston is $1600 at M.D. but $1439 at Macy's, and if I wait until 4th of July, I could get it during their sale for $1295!! So I'm heading over there now to try it out and if there's time, will swing by M.D. in Nashua, just to see if they do feel the same. Could also go there tomorrow, as I need to be at neighbor's for dinner at 6:30.  Talk with you later, or tomorrow.  Love, Sandy","Hi, Tebby: Thought I'd send a reminder about getting a number/etc. for Teas nursery owner from a woman who knows him--when it's convenient.

2022-04-20 03:14:17+00:00,true,5,"  John - Apologies for the long note below but I believe it will be useful to get into the detail to resolve our Colonial recall issues.  Below is some detail on Colonial discrepancies involved with recallable deals in Dec-00 and Mar-01.  Please advise as to what the next course of action should be to clear this up.  I would be happy to meet with any one involved to clarify any issues or questions.  Overview:  I am still unclear as to what recallable means.  It sounds from your note below and everything that Cindy has told me, that by recall you simply mean a buy back or back-to-back as it resides within our system.  However, Colonial is not billing or settling it that way.  They are wanting to collect on their sale for these items while considering our sales for these as never having flowed.  Unless, I am missing something from your conversations with Colonial their may be a disconnect with them.  Note, the first section attached is fairly straight forward.   All recall sales being disputed by Colonial involve direct back-to-back sales with Colonial.  As for deal #658124, I see no problems between Sitara and Unify; Colonial is questioning only 4,500 on day 8 and no other gas on deal 336733.  In fact, Unify will not allow an imbalance on all back-to-back or brokered deals.  Section two shows the items that Colonial has claimed as recalled in Dec-00.  They have yet to give me days so I can not break out the items from our market to our sales to Colonial.  But, they all involve back-to-backs.  Section three shows other TETC items in dispute.  I listed these simply because I consider it possible that these may be involved in the recall items in question.

In talking with Cindy, it appears that at least two tickets were put into Sitara.  One ticket was our sale to Colonial and another ticket has us buying back from Colonial.  Sitara # 658124 is the ticket covering the buyback for March 2001.  Looking at the ticket in Sitara, there is an inconsistency between the Sitara volumes and the Unify bridged volumes.

As discussed with Mike, I  used a combination of the Master Form that Mike has been circulating to the  business teams... and Mike's version of the Home Depot draft.  I've also  incorporated certain provisions that Wal-Mart asked to include in the gas  contract that Marianne Castano drafted.  You will see a number of provisions  bracketed and bold.  Pls give me your thoughts on those and Wal-Mart does not like arbitration and we deleted it in the gas contract.   Have talked with Bob Williams our Enron Corp litig expert and says we need to  hold firm on keeping arbitration if at all possible.   Have kept arbitration  in the draft. Mike S. and Jeff, Wal-Mart has the following standard provision it likes to  include:  ""Non-Interference:   In exercising EESI's rights herein, we shall  not unreasonably interfere with your operations.""   Normally we avoid such  broad provisions but we agreed to include in the draft gas contract and draft  metering agreement.  I did not add this to the draft.  Thoughts? MIke S. and Jeff, any problems with keeping the Mutual Indemnity, Walmart  asked for indemnity in gas contract and we agreed to include one. Mike S. and Jeff, any problems with Severability provision?  Mike H. and Angela, do you want the Add Delete and Substitution provisions  that are in the draft (same as HD), Walmart asked that we add a provision saying we'll use comm. reas. efforts to  mitigate Penalties in the Operational Change provision, I will add this to  the next draft.

2022-04-20 02:35:25+00:00,true,5,"  Since I did not get a chance to meet with you yesterday, I would like to lay  out a few thoughts in this email:  1. Additional areas that might require immediate attention:  ? Consider existing ""Bets"" and large positions already in the books and ways  of adjusting these bets, if necessary (excluding CA):   - NY: large short positions behind Central Hudson and ConEd (IBM deal and  others)   - Carolinas: Standard Offer timing (Springs, Eli Lily, others)   - Illinois: concentration of short regulated positions  ? Quick handle on option positions: do we need to switch customers in some  areas? what options we ought to exercise tomorrow? next week? etc.   - options embedded in the deals   - regulatory switch options   - retail index options   - EAM options  ? Managing value from restructuring legacy deals: in the process of reviewing  the 13 deals, we discovered some provisions in the contracts that were not  captured and managed properly - they might require immediate attention to  minimize losses in these deals.  2. Managing Regulatory Exposure  ? Approximately 80% of EES regulatory exposure is behind 40 utilities ? In the process of rate case decomposition, we need to identify the main  components of each rate structure - create a rate case formula ? These components will fall into two categories: hedgeable (gas, coal,  heating oil fuel costs, inflation, etc.) and ""unhedgeable"" (CTC timing,  standard offer, etc.)    Hedgeable Component      Unhedgeable Component Strategy: Manage within the respective commodity books   Capitalize on  portfolio diversification across the country           Look for ""macro"" hedges and focus activities of EGA  Pricing:  You know best       Risk-based: higher premiums for greater  uncertainty  Policy:  Internal authorizations only on who, how and when to hedge Develop a  limit framework and propose a limit to the BOD  Exposure: Existing VaR model will suffice     Develop and implement stress  scenarios to quantify exposure  3. Other Considerations  ? Curve management: clear responsibilities, periodic review and validation ? Interaction with the EAM world: EAM projects create long positions, pricing  bundled deals with an EAM component ? Flash-to-actual catch up: liquidations validate curve assumptions ? Attention to EES-Canada: currently executed a power deal and a few gas deals ? Process for pricing smaller mid-market deals: sacrificing quantity for  quality - force originators to develop standard deal structures  I could elaborate further on these points. Vlady.","1.

2022-04-20 22:55:15+00:00,true,5,"  I spoke to the guys in the field last week when our deliveries went up and we made the decision to run the pigs.  It was passed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streams possibly coming from the Bitter Lakes and Red Bluff points.  I had them pull moisture readings and they were well below TW's  #7 of water.  They said it was more like drip.  This heavies are in the gas stream that is falling out and collecting in the pipe.  I agree that we need to run pigs when we have the volumes. We in gas control will continue to work with the field to make that happen. If I have the wrong impression on what is happening I apologize.  Please let me know.  Thanks DS     Gary Spraggins 06/13/2001 09:50 AM To: Randy LeBeau/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Darrell Schoolcraft/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Steven January/ET&S/Enron@Enron cc: Rich Jolly/ET&S/Enron@ENRON   Subject: Re: Pigging from P-2 to P-3     Randy, I agree we should continue to pig the line until the liquids have been cleared out then pig it on a regular basis. We would just have to work with Darrell Schoolcraft on TW operations and NNG operations to make it happen. Their may be days that it just does not work  on one side or the other  but once the line is cleared out of liquids we should be able to find a day on a bi-weekly or monthly basis to make it happen. We will work with you any way we can. Also, I'm sure it probably has already been looked into but is there anything that  can be done as to the location the condensate is coming from or could something be done at P-2 to catch it before it goes up the Panhandle lateral. Gary     Randy LeBeau  06/12/2001 05:46 PM  To: Gary Spraggins/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc: Rich Jolly/ET&S/Enron@ENRON   Subject: Pigging from P-2 to P-3  Gary, we recently had to run a pig from P-2 to P-3 in order to push about 2200 barrels of condensate out of the line.  We had started developing problems with some deliveries off that line.  Apparently, in order to run a pig, some volume has to be routed to that line.   I understand that there are some marketing and gas control issues when we do this, but here are some operational concerns when we have to put this off or postpone it:  The condensate and fluids tend to build up to the point that they carry over to a delivery point with Energas.  This point feeds some domestic customers.  We don't want condensate getting into this point. There is a customer on this line (Owens-Corning) who gets fuel from us.  Their process is very sensitive to pressure and volume changes.  At any given time, I am told that they have about a million dollars worth of material in production.  If they lose fuel, the product is lost and we could be liable.  I am also told that once the plant goes down, it could take a long time (even weeks) to get it back up. The Owens-Corning plant does not have an agreement with anyone for alternate fuel.  When the line has large amounts of condensate, we have been asking Energas to supply the plant until the pig passes the point.  This is in order to prevent a slug of liquid from affecting the fuel pressure.  The gas from Energas is NOT measured.  They used to have the contract, but when we got it, they removed their meter setting.  Apparently they agreed (verbally) to supply gas to the plant in March, for a few hours, when a pig was run.  The plant uses about 3 mmcf/d and Energas was on for about 3 hours.  I was notified today that Energas sent us a bill for the March pig run when we used their gas for fuel.....$21,000!  Obviously we will negotiate that amount, but they have us at a disadvantage.  I can only assume that we will receive a similar bill for using them last weekend for about 3 hours. Everyone feels that if we run a pig on a regular schedule, we would not get large condensate amounts into P-3 (which shuts us down, by the way), we would not have to use Energas, we would not risk pushing condensate into a delivery point, and we would not incur the overtime when this happens.  I'm sure Rich has some concerns also for the portion of the line in his region. We would like to run another pig as soon as possible to see what is left in the line and then (depending on what we push into P-3) get on a regular schedule...possibly once a month. What do you think we can do to work something out? Thanks for any help you can give us.        <Embedded StdOleLink>",I spoke to the guys in the field last week when our deliveries went up and we made the decision to run the pigs. It was passed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streams possibly coming from the Bitter Lakes and Red Bluff

2022-04-20 17:21:14+00:00,true,5,"   If you decide not to forward this,  please send it back  to Darleene Barrientos [darleeneah@earthlink.net ]. This is  an actual  petition, and ""signatures""  will be lost if you drop the  line.        Please take 3 minutes out of  your life to do your  part. And be sure to include other members of your   household who are willing to sign.  Petition to the United Nations  Background Information:  Madhu, the government of  Afghanistan, is waging a war  upon women. Since the Taliban took power in  1996,  women have had to wear burqua and have been  beaten and stoned in  public for not having the proper  attire, even if this means simply not  having the mesh  covering in front of their eyes. One woman  was beaten  to death by an angry mob of fundamentalists  for accidentally exposing her  arm(!) while she was  driving. Another was stoned to death for  trying  to leave the country with a man that was not a  relative.  Women are not allowed to work  or even go out in public  without a male relative; professional women such  as  professors, translators, doctors, lawyers, artists and  writers have  been forced from their jobs and  restricted to their homes. Homes where a  woman is  present must have their windows painted so that she  can never  be seen by outsiders. They must wear silent  shoes so that they are never  heard. Women live in fear  of their lives for the slightest misbehavior.  Because  they cannot work, those without male  relatives or husbands are  either starving to death or  begging in the street, even if they hold  Ph.D.'s.  Depression is becoming so widespread that it has  reached  emergency  levels. There is no way in such an extreme Islamic  society  to know the suicide rate with certainty, but  relief workers are estimating  that the suicide rate  among women must be  extraordinarily high: those  who cannot find proper  medication and treatment for severe depression and   would rather take their lives than live in such  conditions. At one of  the rare hospitals for women, a  reporter found still, nearly lifeless  bodies  lying motionless on top of beds, wrapped in their  burqua,  unwilling to speak, eat, or do anything, but  slowly wasting away. Others  have gone mad and were  seen crouched in corners, perpetually rocking or   crying, most of them in fear.  It is at the point where the  term ""human rights  violations"" has become an understatement. Husbands   have the power of life and death over their women  relatives,  especially their wives, but an angry  mob has just as much right to stone  or beat a woman,  often to death, for exposing an inch of flesh or   offending them in the slightest way. Women  enjoyed relative freedom:  to work, to dress generally  as they wanted, and to drive and appear in  public  alone until only 1996. The rapidity of this  transition is the  main reason for the depression and  suicide; Women who were once educators  or doctors or  simply used to basic human freedoms are now  severely  restricted and treated as subhuman in the  name of right-wing  fundamentalist Islam. It is not  their tradition or 'culture', but it is   alien to them, and it is extreme even for those  cultures where  fundamentalism is the rule. Everyone  has a right to a tolerable human   existence, even if they are women in a Muslim country.  If we can threaten military  force in Kosovo the name  of human rights for the sake of ethnic Albanians,   citizens of the world can certainly express  peaceful outrage at the  oppression, murder and  injustice committed against women by the Taliban.   STATEMENT: In signing this, we  agree that the current  treatment of women in Afghanistan is completely   UNACCEPTABLE and deserves action by the  United Nations and that the  current situation overseas  will not be tolerated.  Women's Rights is not a small issue  anywhere, and it  is UNACCEPTABLE for women in 2001 to be treated as   subhuman and as so much property. Equality  and human decency is a  fundamental RIGHT, not a  freedom to be granted, whether one lives in  Afghanistan  or elsewhere.  1) Giuliana D.

For 03 & beyond when LMP is adopted in NE ISO and socialized allocation is eliminated, the congestion component alone in the Boston area will be well over $10/Mwh (based on actual congestion $'s from May 99 to date in the Boston area).  Much like the Dallas situation, these locational congestion charges can be significant and Rogers and Don will begin immediately developing delivered energy pricing curves for specific locations that go well beyond the wholesale pricing points we mark right now.

2022-04-20 09:24:11+00:00,true,5,"  Again, I apologize for the lengthy note but this should serve as good backup for resolution of the original recall problems with Colonial.  First, I am treating Dec-00 as if it is truly a buy / sell situation though I believe that the intention was to recall ENA sales.  The below schedule of buy deals have not been paid (i.e. Colonial never actually billed ENA).  Therefore, I can use the payment due on these payables to clear the existing A/R balance.  The remaining $531.09 is inconsequential.    Second, Colonial gave me erroneous information for Mar-01 recall items.  They originally listed various sale items that were EOL deals, thus indisputable.  We have finally come to agreement that all recalls for Mar-01 should have been booked under ENA sale deal #336733, days 8, 22, and 24-26, a total of 22,500 MMBtu recalled.  Upon research of this new information it has been determined that the entire 22,500 is booked as buy / sell, as expected.  However the purchase side shows that 18,000 MMBtu of these items actually had an ENA purchase price of $0.00000 and 4,500 MMBtu at $5.54000, which was never billed to ENA but was paid.  Therefore, it seems obvious to me that in light of no price or non-billing of these purchases, the real intent was a true recall of our sales with no affect to the purchase side at all.  Furthermore, both the sales and purchase sides of the 22,500 MMBtu for Mar-01 has been ""zeroed"" out, creating a total credit due to Colonial of $103,050.  Please let me know if there are any objections to this.  If so, I will need support from Cindy / Dick for the purchases booked for Mar-01 prod. and their ""0"" prices.  See the below schedule for Mar-01 items that have been zeroed out.

This additional gas quality specification will be imposed two (2) business days after this notice is posted on Columbia's internet electronic bulletin board.   In addition to complying with this additional gas quality specification, all parties delivering or causing gas to be delivered into the Columbia-operated Blue Water system on the Western Shoreline, the Southwestern Extension, or on the Header (west of the system null point) may be required to provide evidence to Columbia that such gas is being processed at the Blue Water Processing Plant to ensure that the composite gas stream at Egan, Louisiana has a gross heating value of 1050 Btu or less.  Evidence of the gas processing agreements may be required upon Columbia's request.  Failure of a party to comply with the additional gas quality specification set forth above and to provide Columbia Gulf with evidence, upon request, of a gas processing agreement for gas delivered to the Blue Water system will result in Columbia Gulf refusing to accept gas from such party and to make corresponding redeliveries.  Imposition of this additional gas quality specification does not relieve any party delivering gas or causing gas to be delivered to Columbia's system from its existing obligations to comply with the gas quality specifications set forth in Section 25.1 of Columbia's tariff, to ensure the merchantability of the gas, and to ensure that gas has been properly processed before entering Columbia's system.  Columbia, pursuant to the terms of Section 25.2(a) of its tariff, is imposing this additional gas quality specification as it has determined, in its reasonable judgment, that harm to its pipeline system and its operations may occur if it receives gas on its system that fails to meet this additional gas quality specification.  Columbia reserves the right to revise this additional gas quality specification upon further analysis of the gas that is being received by Columbia and reevaluation of the potential harm to Columbia's pipeline system and its operations.  You are further placed on notice that Columbia will hold you responsible and seek legal redress for any damages it incurs as a result of the higher Btu gas.  Any questions about this notice may be directed to Gary Espey, (713) 267-4761, or to John Pillion, (713) 267-4764.

To increase  our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid  Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600  and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to  the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing  system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This  conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.  In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in  EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then  your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to  reflect the new dialing scheme.

I'd like for us to get with her and see if we can't get this resolved faster with her involvement. I'm out of the office today at an off site customer meeting but could be available tomorrow.  Meredith -- what does your schedule look like Wednesday afternoon? Can you save 10-20 minutes for me and Scott. Please let me know you availability.  Cindy         Enron North America Corp.  From:  Scott Dozier                           05/11/2001 11:00 AM       To: John Hodge/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Cynthia Franklin/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Dick Jenkins/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: Colonial Outstanding AR     John - Apologies for the long note below but I believe it will be useful to get into the detail to resolve our Colonial recall issues.  Below is some detail on Colonial discrepancies involved with recallable deals in Dec-00 and Mar-01.  Please advise as to what the next course of action should be to clear this up.  I would be happy to meet with any one involved to clarify any issues or questions.  Overview:  I am still unclear as to what recallable means.  It sounds from your note below and everything that Cindy has told me, that by recall you simply mean a buy back or back-to-back as it resides within our system.  However, Colonial is not billing or settling it that way.  They are wanting to collect on their sale for these items while considering our sales for these as never having flowed.  Unless, I am missing something from your conversations with Colonial their may be a disconnect with them.  Note, the first section attached is fairly straight forward.   All recall sales being disputed by Colonial involve direct back-to-back sales with Colonial.  As for deal #658124, I see no problems between Sitara and Unify; Colonial is questioning only 4,500 on day 8 and no other gas on deal 336733.  In fact, Unify will not allow an imbalance on all back-to-back or brokered deals.  Section two shows the items that Colonial has claimed as recalled in Dec-00.  They have yet to give me days so I can not break out the items from our market to our sales to Colonial.  But, they all involve back-to-backs.  Section three shows other TETC items in dispute.  I listed these simply because I consider it possible that these may be involved in the recall items in question.  Thank you - Scott Dozier 5-7213      John Hodge 05/09/2001 05:14 PM To: Scott Dozier/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Cynthia Franklin/Corp/Enron@ENRON   Subject: Re: Colonial Outstanding AR     According to Dick's notes from the deal ticket, we recalled the gas on 12/7/00, 12/28-31/00, 3/8/01, 3/22/01 and 3/24-26/01.  In talking with Cindy, it appears that at least two tickets were put into Sitara.  One ticket was our sale to Colonial and another ticket has us buying back from Colonial.  Sitara # 658124 is the ticket covering the buyback for March 2001.  Looking at the ticket in Sitara, there is an inconsistency between the Sitara volumes and the Unify bridged volumes.

2022-04-20 02:50:47+00:00,true,5,"  Since I did not get a chance to meet with you yesterday, I would like to lay out a few thoughts in this email:  1. Additional areas that might require immediate attention:  ? Consider existing ""Bets"" and large positions already in the books and ways of adjusting these bets, if necessary (excluding CA):   - NY: large short positions behind Central Hudson and ConEd (IBM deal and others)   - Carolinas: Standard Offer timing (Springs, Eli Lily, others)   - Illinois: concentration of short regulated positions  ? Quick handle on option positions: do we need to switch customers in some areas? what options we ought to exercise tomorrow? next week? etc.   - options embedded in the deals   - regulatory switch options   - retail index options   - EAM options  ? Managing value from restructuring legacy deals: in the process of reviewing the 13 deals, we discovered some provisions in the contracts that were not captured and managed properly - they might require immediate attention to minimize losses in these deals.  2. Managing Regulatory Exposure  ? Approximately 80% of EES regulatory exposure is behind 40 utilities ? In the process of rate case decomposition, we need to identify the main components of each rate structure - create a rate case formula ? These components will fall into two categories: hedgeable (gas, coal, heating oil fuel costs, inflation, etc.) and ""unhedgeable"" (CTC timing, standard offer, etc.)    Hedgeable Component      Unhedgeable Component Strategy: Manage within the respective commodity books   Capitalize on portfolio diversification across the country           Look for ""macro"" hedges and focus activities of EGA  Pricing:  You know best       Risk-based: higher premiums for greater uncertainty  Policy:  Internal authorizations only on who, how and when to hedge Develop a limit framework and propose a limit to the BOD  Exposure: Existing VaR model will suffice     Develop and implement stress scenarios to quantify exposure  3. Other Considerations  ? Curve management: clear responsibilities, periodic review and validation ? Interaction with the EAM world: EAM projects create long positions, pricing bundled deals with an EAM component ? Flash-to-actual catch up: liquidations validate curve assumptions ? Attention to EES-Canada: currently executed a power deal and a few gas deals ? Process for pricing smaller mid-market deals: sacrificing quantity for quality - force originators to develop standard deal structures  I could elaborate further on these points. Vlady.","3.

2022-04-20 11:15:46+00:00,true,5,"  Larry, Steve & Jack,  Attached is an excel document with a transaction diagram summarizing the impact of an ISDA based transaction (financial swap) to fix the price of the APEA supply.  Effectively, Glendale enters into a transaction (under the ISDA) in which it ""swaps"" payments with a counter-party.  For the APEA transaction, Glendale pays the ISDA counter-party a fixed price for an agreed to term and quantity and receives the 1st of month AECO index.  Glendale, in turn, pays that index price to APEA.  The impact is that Glendale has fixed its price under the APEA contract for such term and quantity as meets its needs.     The key is to get the ISDA executed.  Then we can focus on the term, quantity and price provisions of the transaction.  An important factor to remember under the ISDA and in any financial transaction is that regardless of the physical delivery the ISDA based swap occurs.  In other words, if the physical supply from AECO were interrupted by Force Majeure or other reason, Glendale is still obligated to ""swap"" payments with its ISDA counter-party.  As an example, assume that Glendale enters into a financial swap for 4,000 MMBtu/d for a 1 year term effective July 2001, swapping the 1st of month AECO index for a fixed price of $4.10 US/MMBtu.  Also assume that APEA is unable to deliver gas for the entire month of August 2001 because of a pipeline outage (Force Majeure) and that the AECO 1st of month index for August is $5.00 US/MMBtu.  Under the swap, Glendale pays the financial counterparty $508,400 (31 days * 4,000 MMBtu/d * $4.10/MMBtu).  The financial counterparty pays Glendale $620,000 (31 days * 4,000 MMBtu/d * $5.00/MMBtu).  The net position is a payment to Glendale of $111,600.  Call me if you have any questions about this.  I will coordinate with Kim Ward to expedite the ISDA.  Kim and I can also sit down with you to discuss these transactions.

2022-04-20 18:32:46+00:00,true,5,"   Hi Marilyn,  I am helping a friend plan an ""away"" wedding.  I was wondering if you knew of or would suggest any resorts that have full wedding services that we can start looking at.  They want simple wedding and are going to invite their close family and friends, but are not sure who will be able to come yet.  I am thinking it will probably be about 10 people.  They definitely want something tropical and probably all-inclusive would be best.  I had a friend who got married in Playa de Carmen, but I'm not sure which resort.  I was thinking somewhere in Mexico would be good but definitely not Cancun.  They are on a tight budget because they will be paying for it themselves.  So here are the details about what we are looking for: Tropical All-Inclusive Resort Round trip airfare Travel date between November 2001 and January 2002 (what time is cheaper?) Wedding Services including someone to perform the ceremony, flowers for the bride, photography, location for ceremony (possibly on the beach), location for reception for about 10 people (can be restaurant at the resort)  I couldn't discuss this on the phone because it is my coworkers boyfriend and I who are planning it and she sits right next to me.  If you could give me a list of resorts we will look over them, narrow it down, and then get back to you.  Thank you so much for your help!

2022-04-20 05:35:33+00:00,false,5,"  Yes.  That would be good.  However, John and I have spoken and Dick Jenkins and I have spoken.  I have confirmation from both of these traders that the mechanism for the recall was to purchase the gas back at an agreed price, different from the sell price (creating multiple back-to-backs with Colonial).  Therefore, the way these items sit in our system seems correct.  Furthermore, I have left a message with Colonial's accountant (Fri May 11) on this stating our position and that they needed to work internally to determine if there should be a conversation between our marketers and their marketers.  I think it might be useful for you, Meredith, and I to sit down and talk about specific paths for these items, especially Dec/00.  At the very least that would help me put my ducks in a row when I am talking to Colonial about collection on Dec/00.  Under our current position Colonial owes us for Dec-00.  Wednesday is good for me.  Thanks.         Enron North America Corp.

Below is some detail on Colonial discrepancies involved with recallable deals in Dec-00 and Mar-01.  Please advise as to what the next course of action should be to clear this up.  I would be happy to meet with any one involved to clarify any issues or questions.  Overview:  I am still unclear as to what recallable means.  It sounds from your note below and everything that Cindy has told me, that by recall you simply mean a buy back or back-to-back as it resides within our system.  However, Colonial is not billing or settling it that way.  They are wanting to collect on their sale for these items while considering our sales for these as never having flowed.  Unless, I am missing something from your conversations with Colonial their may be a disconnect with them.  Note, the first section attached is fairly straight forward.   All recall sales being disputed by Colonial involve direct back-to-back sales with Colonial.  As for deal #658124, I see no problems between Sitara and Unify; Colonial is questioning only 4,500 on day 8 and no other gas on deal 336733.  In fact, Unify will not allow an imbalance on all back-to-back or brokered deals.  Section two shows the items that Colonial has claimed as recalled in Dec-00.  They have yet to give me days so I can not break out the items from our market to our sales to Colonial.  But, they all involve back-to-backs.  Section three shows other TETC items in dispute.  I listed these simply because I consider it possible that these may be involved in the recall items in question.

2022-04-20 11:44:53+00:00,true,6,"   Roberto,  Below are some observations:   For the year 2000 (ignoring October), EcoElectrica sold power to PREPA for:  Capacity: $0.037/kwh Energy:  $0.026/kwh Total:  $0.063/kwh   In 2001 Jan-April:  Capacity: $0.049/kwh increase of $0.012/kwh (+32.4%) Energy:  $0.037/kwh increase of $0.011/kwh (+42.3%) Total:  $0.086/kwh  The increase in energy payment mirrors the increase in fuel cost for 2001 versus 2000. Cabot contract LNG Commodity Charge increased 50% from $2.32/MMBtu to $3.48/MMBtu in 2001.  However, the per unit increase in Capacity Payment is almost entirely due to PREPA dispatching Eco at a lower % of availability in 2001. Additionally, PREPA has been offered kwh's above a 76% dispatch for $5.80/MMBtu or $0.0435/kwh but has not purchased them. If PREPA were to dispatch Eco at 88%, I estimate that their total purchase cost of all kwh's purchased would be $0.074/kwh in 2001.  Also, it is not an Apples-to-Apples comparison when PREPA compares their cost of generation using fuel cost only to our cost of generation that includes return of investment capital as well as fuel cost.

The lowest inventory levels (3 fuels) Eco has seen this year was just before the May LNG cargo. Eco was down to 15.8 days on-site. If Eco had sold 1,000,000 gallons of LPG to ProCaribe in January, then ProCaribe would have decreased its March purchase by 1,000,000 gallons (1 day of Eco consumption) and Eco would have needed to buy 200,000 gallons (0.2 days) on the March cargo. In other words, Eco would have needed to replace only 20% of the LPG it sold. The total cargo size of the March cargo would have been 800,000 gallons less than it was. In May, the fuel on-site would have been exactly 15 days.  2. Mont Belvieu in March was $0.544 and in May it was $0.512. Eco's buyback price in March would have been $0.614 versus its sales price to ProCaribe of $0.70.   Let me know if you have any other questions.

2022-04-20 02:04:01+00:00,true,6,"  Please be advised that the pricing for the May LPG delivery into Puerto Rico has been changed as follows:   Previous: 10,000 MT +/- 5% @ Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading plus 7 cents per gallon   Current:   2,600 MT (1,354,600 gallons)    @ 58.625 cents + (Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading minus Average Mont Belvieu for May 17, 18, 21)    Remainder of Cargo @ Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading plus 7 cents per gallon   Basis:  521 Gallons/MT     Note that the price component (Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading minus Average Mont Belvieu for May 17, 18, 21) will be equal to zero if   the bill of lading date is May 18th. Otherwise, this component will result in a small increase or decrease in the pricing. ELFI was able to give ProCaribe an   ""almost"" Fixed Price on the 2600 MT by hedging Mont Belvieu for May 17, 18, and 21 (corresponds to a B/L date of May 18th). ProCaribe bears the    risk/benefit of a different B/L date.   The 2600 MT for which the price is fixed, represents the amount of LPG that has been sold to-date since borrowing began in April. The price that ProCaribe will receive for the volumes sold in April will be based on a Mont Belvieu price of 54.281. The fixed price of the upcoming cargo could be thought of as April Mont Belvieu plus 4.344 cents per gallon (54.281+4.344 = 58.625). The price that ProCaribe will receive for the volumes sold May 1st through May 9th should be thought of as being based on May Mont Belvieu through May 9th which is ~51.9 cents. The fixed price of the upcoming cargo could be thought of as May 1st-9th Mont Belvieu plus 6.725 cents per gallon (51.9+6.725 = 58.625).    Any hedging of the remainder of the volume should be done once the prices are known for May 17, 18, and 21st. ProCaribe is taking a risk that Mont Belvieu for May 17, 18, and 21 could be higher than May 10th - 31st. That would make the Mont Belvieu average used in calculating the cost of the cargo a higher number than the Mont Belvieu average used in calculating ProCaribe's sales price. The cost of hedging out this risk is 1-1.5 cents. ProCaribe should just take the risk.      Regards,  Paul","Please be advised that the pricing for the May LPG delivery into Puerto Rico has changed as follows: Previous: 10,000 MT +/- 5% @ Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading plus 7 cents per gallon.

It looks like the tubes have been overheated.  The tubes had to be cut and plugged, but the first attempt failed as they found some leakage in the welding on the cutted tubes end when the superheater was pressure tested and they had to reweld the tubes end once more. They are now placing some protection around the tubes end to avoid melting down the ends on the cutted tubes.  The vessel is expecting to have both boiler into service within 2 hrs.  We are not quite sure yet what has caused this cracks, but it looks like the tubes have been overheated, i.e rescriced flow of steam through the pipes. The boiler will be examinated and closely investigate to establish the cause of the deformation of the tubes.  The tubes will also be sent to a metallurgist to get an anylyis of the material.

2022-04-20 00:44:49+00:00,true,6,"  Dear jason,   Throughout the course of the 2000-2001 Rockets season, viewers of Rockets telecasts on UPN 20 were asked to log on to rockets.com and submit a question to broadcasters Bill Worrell and Calvin Murphy.  Worrell and Murphy chose one question each game to answer live on-air, with all participants who submitted a question being entered into a drawing for the chance to win a Compaq computer and an autographed Rockets item.  Congratulations to Kris Martinak of Houston! Kris was selected from 2,754 participants as the winner of a Compaq Presario 7000 personal computer and a Rockets 2000-2001 Team Autographed Basketball.  Look for the Compaq Question of the Game contest again next Rockets season. In the meantime, be sure to visit rockets.com often this offseason to keep abreast of the latest Rockets developments.    ----------------------------------------------------- Have any friends or family that would like the latest information on the Houston Rockets delivered right to their e-mail box?

Have you gone out to the market to check if you can get a better deal?  This means we are paying MB +9 in July.  Do you think we should expose ourselves to a bit of risk or cover ourselves?  Miguel  How long until you have the $800K to pay it ?  Is it 10 days or 30.  If it is not long then we should be able to delay payment by a few days.

Please remember that this document is custom-tuned to match-up with the liability, risk and insurance allocation mechanism set out in the MetGas LNG SPA.  This document would probably be a good starting point for the COU to be used under the Oman LNG SPA and the AdGas LNG SPA; however it will need to be coordinated with those documents and ultimately agreed by Greenfield's Marine P&I insurers.   We used Philip Weems of King & Spalding for outside legal assistance on this document (he has very valuable experience on these issues and documents) and recommend for the sake of efficiency and cost savings that we do so on any Dabhol Port COU as well.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ----------------------------------------  Rediff.com Meeting with DPC was good, says Godbole, Priya Ganapati in Bombay=20  Officials of US energy giant Enron Corp-promoted Dabhol Power Company who m= et with the Godbole committee on Tuesday to discuss the fate of the controv= ersial $2.9-billion power project were non-committal on the outcome of the = talks, but said that the ""meeting was good"". Both the sides, however, were = unanimous that it would take more discussions to arrive at a peaceful solut= ion to the vexed issue. Tuesday's meeting was cordial and broke fresh groun= d, said sources, indicating that the problem may yet be resolved. Both the = parties have decided to meet again and take the discussions forward. Energy=  secretary V M Lal, speaking to the reporters, informed that both the parti= es have decided to meet again and continue the deliberations, but fresh dat= e for the meeting has not been fixed yet. The meeting concluded with both t= he sides agreeing to extend the tenure of the Godbole committee which was s= lated to expire on Wednesday. The period for which the panel's tenure has b= een extended has not yet been decided.=20  Speaking after the meeting Madhav Godbole, chairman of the committee set up=  to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with DPC, said: ""The meeting w= as quite productive. Basically, we discussed each other's position in the i= ssue. The Government of India has put forth a set of proposals before the D= PC and we shall see how things proceed from here."" He, however, declined to=  spell out what the 'new set of proposals' comprised. When asked what did t= he committee think of DPC's proposal to cut power tariff by 10 per cent, Go= dbole said: ""It is too early to talk about specifics at this point. We disc= ussed generalities and it was a satisfactory meeting."" Central government n= ominee A V Gokak, who attended the meeting for the first time, said: ""The g= overnment is keen to resolve the vexed issue and will actively participate = in the process and talks.""=20  ""The negotiations would take into account the interests of all the sides,"" = Gokak said. ""Nobody's intentions can be doubted as the deliberations are on=  to come to an amicable solution which is agreeable to all,"" he said when a= sked to comment on DPC's earlier posture of taking the meeting only as a co= urtesy call. DPC chief K Wade Kline said that only general issues were disc= ussed at the meeting and that the deliberations were ""good"". The renegotiat= ion committee meeting was headed by Madhav Godbole, energy secretary V M La= l, MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal, finance secretary S K Srivastav and central = nominee A V Gokak, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh. The Dabhol Power Company te= am was represented by DPC chief K Wade Cline, president Neil McGregor, Bech= tel representative Phiroz J Nagarwala, DPC chief financial officer S Mohan = Gurunath, DPC vice-president Sanjeev Khandkar and IDBI official Mukesh Tyag= i, Rajesh Sivaraman, and Paul Kraft, general counsel.=20  Earlier analysts had said the meeting is unlikely to yield any result as Da= bhol Power Company had announced that the meeting would only be a courtesy = call. The panel was formed last month by the Maharashtra state government t= o renegotiate the tariffs charged by the 2,184 MW power project. Maharashtr= a State Electricity Board, which agreed in 1995 to buy the plant's entire o= utput, says the power is too costly and has defaulted on $48 million of pow= er payments. Dabhol issued a notice this month to cancel its power purchase=  deal. The Maharashtra government has asked the panel to renegotiate the pr= oject with Dabhol and bring down the tariff. The first meeting scheduled fo= r May 5, was cancelled as Enron sought more time to attend the meeting, whi= le the second meeting which was held on May 11 concluded without any transa= ction in which, of the nine members, five including central nominee A V Gok= ak were absent. Later, it was fixed for May 23, which also had to be cancel= led in wake of the resignation by the committee chairman Madhav Godbole fol= lowing remarks by NCP chief Sharad Pawar about the negative attitude of the=  renegotiation committee.=20  However, the Maharashtra Cabinet unanimously decided not to accept his resi= gnation. Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh wrote a letter to him=  after the Cabinet meeting stating that ""the state government has full fait= h and confidence in his working, and urge you to withdraw your resignation = as the chairman of the committee."" An MSEB official had on Monday said that=  the success of the re-negotiations would largely depend on the co-operatio= n of DPC officials as well as the Union government, particularly over the i= ssue of the second phase's 1444 mw power offtake.

Whi= le this alone may not be adequate to resolve the on-going differences, the = proposal has reportedly been well received by domestic lenders.

A senior MERC official told Business S= tandard, ""While initially MSEB said that it was   not in possession of the = documents, it later told  the commission that the documents were in fact av= ailable with it but not the detailed document.""=20  The commission also found it peculiar that MSEB had chosen to merely reiter= ate the legal  submission made by DPC with regards to the confidentiality a= ttached to certain key documents  instead of employing the services of the = large  in-house legal department.  According to a senior government officia= l, while the Reliance-promoted Patalganga project and  Ispat-promoted Bhadr= awati projects are yet to achieve financial closure, the petitions before M= ERC would serve as the touchstone ruling for deciding upon the issue of pub= lic access to  information.=20  Both MSEB and DPC as well as the Reliance and Ispat groups would have to ex= plain how they could withhold the documents sought by the common public und= er the provisions of the act.

Top government officials t= old The Financial Express that the consequences of commercial   decisions t= aken by the state government or the  Maharashtra State Electricity Board (M= SEB) will   not be passed on to the consumers across the  country. Besides,=  NTPC is a central power sector organisation whose main task is generation = and it has no expertise in power trading, the  sources said.   Moreover, as per officials, any attempt to force NTPC to buy high-cost pow= er will adversely affect the corporation's financial health, as it is alrea= dy struggling to recover huge dues from the state electricity boards (SEBs)= .  ""The basic objective of reforms in India's power sector is to provide po= wer at reasonable cost. The Maharashtra government's proposals to distribut= e high-cost Dabhol power through NTPC or  through PTC will be clearly again= st the objective of reforms and consumer interests,"" said a senior  governm= ent official.Sources said even PTC cannot be asked to buy and distribute po= wer of the Dabhol plant. This is because the Centre has already refused to = declare Dabhol project as a mega power project while PTC only deals with th= e power from mega projects, which are inter-state projects. Officials said = the Centre is of the view that if any decision is taken to impose high cost=  power from Dabhol on other states, it will be an open invitation to other = states to pass on their existing liabilities vis-a-vis private producers to=  the central government. ""This will not be acceptable to the government of = India,"" the sources said.  Coming down heavily on the Maharashtra government, the officials said the s= tate government's   unwillingness to rationalise tariffs has crippled MSEB'= s ability to make available reasonably priced power in the state. ""The Maha= rashtra government has been directly interfering in MSEB's efforts to colle= ct arrears which have mounted to a whopping Rs 5,000 crores,"" the officials=  said. On the condition of anonymity, a highly placed central government of= ficial said, ""Although the Centre is committed to support any worthwhile id= ea acceptable to both MSEB and DPC for settling the problem, it would be mo= re advisable for the state government to rise above politics and carry out = re-negotiations in a constructive manner so that sustainable solution is fo= und.""

""There has been no increase in tariff since September 1998 and, = the total receivables of MSEB are in the range of Rs 5,000 crore,"" the offi= cials said. Central government sources informed that the Maharashtra govern= ment has been announcing subsidies to specified categories of consumers suc= h as powerlooms and agriculturists without ensuring that subsidies are paid=  to MSEB.

Sources said that Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC chief = financial officer Mohan Gurunath, in separate letters had asked the MSEB no= t to pay the April cheque. They said that MSEB should make the payment with= out any 'ifs and buts' as there is no provision of payment under protest in= corporated in the power purchase agreement (PPA). MSEB was highly disappoin= ted over the return of its cheque by the Bank of America on grounds that it=  cannot accept the cheque, following clear cut directives from the DPC.=20    ""Suddenly, Mr Gurunath calls up this morning and tells that a company off= icial will come to collect the cheque, even if it is to be issued under pro= test.

According to S.K. Chakrabarti, actin= g chairman and managing director of the Industrial Development Bank of Indi= a (IDBI), DPC has informed lenders in writing that there may be scope to re= duce the power tariffs by ten per cent from the existing levels.This is the=  first time since the Dabhol controversy exploded that Enron, the main prom= oter of DPC, has shown any sign of wanting to renegotiate tariffs. Accordin= g to bankers, DPC will charge a tariff of Rs  3.50 per unit after Phase II = of the project is commissioned as per the power purchase agreement. However= , in its latest communication to lenders through its lawyers, White and Cas= e, DPC has told lenders that there is room for the tariffs to be renegotiat= ed downwards by ten per cent to Rs 3.15 per unit from the existing rate of = Rs 3.50 per unit.  Speaking to the press, Chakrabarti said that he was hopeful of an amicable = resolution of all outstanding issues between DPC and MSEB. ``We have also i= mpressed upon DPC that there is scope to reduce the tariffs further,'' he a= dded.According to the lending banks, DPC has said that tariffs can be revis= ed downwards if contracts for buying   liquefied natural gas (LNG) are rene= gotiated with the sellers. This is because LNG prices have come down signif= icantly since the contracts were signed a couple of years ago.DPC has also = indicated that LNG shipping and carriage rates can also be renegotiated to = help reduce tariffs. These rates have also fallen since the contracts were = signed in the nineties. The major lenders are supposed to meet in Singapore=  on June 5 and 6 to discuss matters further. Moreover, IDBI has set up a co= mmittee for the domestic lenders to help  them take a united stand in the m= atter.  ``We will try and convince the foreign lenders that they should not=  take any action to precipitate matters further,'' Chakrabarti said.

Foreign banks provide the balance of the loans but some of = them are protected by guarantees from Indian financial institutions. Indian=  bankers fear the foreign banks may call in the guarantees. S.K. Chakrabati= , chairman of the Industrial Development Bank of India, which accounts for = about a third of Indian banks' total exposure of Rs66bn (Dollars 1.4bn), ye= sterday said he was ""substantially hopeful"" of solving the rift. Lenders to=  Enron's Indian unit, Dabhol Power Company, will meet in Singapore on June = 5-6. The Indian lenders, which include the State Bank of India, the country= 's biggest, and ICICI, will meet tomorrow to devise a strategy that would r= ely more on ""persuasion because we lack the power of veto"", one Indian offi= cial said.=20  Foreign lenders, which include US Exim, Bank of America and Industrial Bank=  of Japan, have become increasingly dissatisfied with the payments record o= f Dabhol's sole client, Maharashtra State Electricity Board. MSEB owes DPC = Dollars 45m in unpaid bills. Last month foreign banks gave Dabhol the autho= rity to withdraw from the project. Last week, Dabhol issued a ""pre-terminat= ion notice"" to withdraw in  six months. The past few days of tit-for-tat mo= ves by Dabhol and MSEB have also raised complex legal issues. MSEB's decisi= on to cancel the power purchase agreement, which defines contractual relati= ons with Enron, seems destined to go to court. The question is: which court= ? The agreement is governed by and based on English law. But the MSEB has r= eferred the cancellation of the agreement, whose high tariffs are at the ro= ot of the dispute, to the untested electricity regulator.  This is a risky = strategy. ""The regulator is not the authority that can decide on a purely c= ontractual issue between parties,"" says a Bombay commercial lawyer. ""In fac= t, even an Indian court of law would have to refer the matter to an arbitra= tion tribunal as identified in the agreement.""=20  Enron launched arbitration proceedings on April 12 after increasingly bitte= r wrangling. Many foreign bankers regard this official undermining of a con= tract as a dangerous game of ""power poker"", which is already having a chill= ing effect on multinationals' plans to invest in India's power and  telecom= munications sectors. Three companies have told the Financial Times privatel= y that they were reviewing their involvement with and strategy in India. On= e senior executive pointed out that the risk premium for investors in India=  has already gone up in the past six weeks. He said the ""hurdle rate of ret= urn"" - the minimum rate of return on equity in dollars - that his and other=  companies eyeing opportunities in India were seeking had risen by one to t= wo percentage points. ""If this Enron thing works out badly,"" the senior exe= cutive said, ""the hurdle rate is going to be   infinity."" Foreign companies=  are also becoming nervous by increasing domestic hostility. At the weekend= , protestors attacked the Orissa-based subsidiary of the US energy company,=  AES. Last week, about 2,000 protesters burnt down AES offices in northern = Orissa. The state of Orissa pioneered the privatisation of power distributi= on in India.=20  The Enron dispute has also forced Karnataka, to the south of Maharashtra, t= o re-open 11 power purchase agreements signed with independent producers in=  a move to cut electricity tariffs. Enron's position on its agreement remai= ns unchanged. It refuses to renegotiate the contract, as the Indians sugges= t, based on the findings of a recently published official report by the res= pected politician, Madhav Godbole. Enron regards the report as hostile even=  though the author was equally critical of the ""quality of governance"" in t= he early to mid-1990s when the agreement was signed. Commentators say this = is a reference to the administration of Sharad Pawar, who as the then leade= r of Maharashtra was, and remains, a keen advocate of Enron's interests.=20  Meanwhile, K. Wade Cline, managing director of Dabhol, has told MSEB in a l= etter dated May 25 that the utility's cancellation of the agreement is not = valid. MSEB axed the contract because, it says, of Enron's poor plant perfo= rmance, notably a failure to raise capacity from a cold start in three hour= s, which Enron disputes. Yesterday, an Enron official picked up for the sec= ond time a cheque for Rs1.37bn that MSEB paid last week ""under protest"", bu= t which was returned by the US company, apparently to clear any misundersta= nding about its position. As Mr Cline said in his leaked letter: ""MSEB cann= ot have it both ways. We will rely upon any payment as constituting an uneq= uivocal affirmation of the validity of the PPA (power purchase agreement by= ) MSEB."" Enron's  choreographed show of corporate pique yesterday at least = shows it has learned something about the ways of Indian political play-acti= ng.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE INDIAN EXPRESS, Tuesday, May 29, 2001 Worried FIs in fresh bid to defuse Dabhol crisis  Worried over the prospects of their Rs 6,600 exposure to the Dabhol project=  becoming non-performing assets (NPAs), Indian lenders led by the Industria= l Development Bank of India (IDBI) have decided to meet on May 30, here wit= h the main objective of persuading the offshore lenders against  precipitat= ing matters further and request them to show restraint.IDBI, which has an e= xposure of Rs 2,158 crore in the Dabhol project and has provided a guarante= e forRs 1,528 crore to the offshore lenders, has taken the initiative to co= nvene the May 30 meet in a bid to  avert a major lending crisis. IDBI is be= lieved to have expressed concern over the lack of guarantee cover for the I= FIs as against the similar protection enjoyed by the offshore lenders.  For the first time the Indian lenders today disclosed their exact exposure = to DPC, which stood at Rs 6,600 crore. Other than IDBI, the domestic lender= s include ICICI, State Bank of India and Canara   Bank. FIs feel that if En= ron ultimately decides to pull out at this stage, terminating the power pur= chase  agreement, it will have serious consequences with regard to the inve= stments made by the FIs in the project. The Wednesday's meeting is expected=  to be attended by the representatives of IDBI, ICICI, State Bank of India,=  Industrial Finance Corporation of India and Canara Bank to chalk out futur= e course of action.  ""However, we will have to persuade the foreign lenders that crisis should n= ot be further precipitated and they should not exert pressure on the termin= ation of project,"" sources said, adding, ""Considering all aspects, the FIs = are of the view that the Dabhol phase-II, which is already completed to the=  extent of 90 per cent,should be allowed to be fully completed and an alter= native for distribution of power should be explored, having regard to the i= nability of the MSEB to absorb the Dabhol phase-II power.""Foreign lenders, = already upset with the payment delays and the controversy over the PPA canc= ellation, are apparently not happy with the turn of events. ""Indian lenders=  will be the losers. Foreign lenders exposure is backed by guarantees. That= 's not the case with Indian lenders,"" FI sources said, adding,  ""looking at=  their stand so far, foreign lenders may cash their guarantees."" There is  = also speculation that belligerent foreign lenders are all set to encash the=  deferred  payment guarantees.","Rediff.com,Tuesday, May 29, 2001.

2022-04-20 11:15:11+00:00,true,6,"  Shubh,  I spoke with Dan today on this issue.  As you and I discussed there are basically two CoU issues that you are pursuing. A CoU for use at Dabhol.  As Dan suggested in the message below, the CoU we negotiated with Malaysia LNG Tiga and Malaysia International Shipping Company in connection with the MetGas LNG SPA for the India gas pipeline project would probably be a good starting point for the CoU to be used at Dabhol.  However it will need to be coordinated with the other project documents and the DPC/GSC C/P for Lakshmi and ultimately agreed by the P&I insurers for Lakshmi. We (Enron) has also negotiated a 'short form' of CoU that has been used by Oman LNG for the ships loading Enron's spot cargoes loaded at their terminal.  As Dan has said, since OLNG drives their own CoU we waited until they proposed a CoU and we then negotiated to the final version.  Usually the purchaser waits until the seller presents the CoU and then they negotiate it.  However, we understand that MOL, acting for GSC, want to get this CoU checked off with their P&I insurers so they will have one less thing to do when the ship comes into service.  We could go to OLNG and request their CoU and send it to MOL for them to review with their legal advisers and their P&I.  Alternately we could request that OLNG use for the Lakshmi, the same CoU as we (Enron) have negotiated for the spot cargoes.  Not having been involved in the negotiations, I do not know how they differ or even if GSC will want to use the version used by Enron.   Dan has said that with the complications now existing with ship lenders and the Dabhol PTN, he is snowed under and is not able to work on CoUs.  Philip Weems of King & Spalding (outside legal assistance) worked on both the MetGas and the Enron spot cargo documents as he has very valuable experience on these issues.  Dan has recommended that DPC use Philip but with the current situation, you may not want to get into additional legal fees or even start an exercise that may be totally in vain. Please advise of your thoughts on the above.  I will phone you early tomorrow morning, Houston time.   Tony   ","Shubh, I spoke with Dan today on this issue.

The current NYMEX price for gas in January (which the best price we can get today) is $4.60.  Today's cash price for prompt delivery is about $3.80-$3.90.  The incentive is about $71,000 at the high end (Jan) and about break even at the low end (prompt).  Even at the high end, there isn't much incentive when you take into account the extra day of cooling down you would need.  I talked to Jonathan Whitehead about this and he agreed that it probably isn't worth doing on this trip.

The remaining capital will stay invested.  Since mid to late 2000, the fund has reportedly had trouble finding new suitable investments.  Rather than invest in companies it did not find viable, the firm's managers have decided to return their excess assets.  The firm was founded in March 2000 by a formidable team, seeking to capitalize on the raging bull market.  The timing could not have been worse. The firm's founding in March 2000 came at the beginning of the Internet bubble's burst, and the market declines that came with it.  While the firm was able to garner returns early on, its prospects became increasingly dim as the floor fell out of the IPO market.  The firm started out looking to get into companies on the ground floor by operating a ""cross-over"" style fund.  The fund invested in companies with a public offering on the horizon.  Ideally, the firm would be able to identify solid companies and benefit handsomely after an IPO pop.  The firm's established staff helped lend an air of prestige to the firm itself.  Octane Capital was originally founded with the help of Emeric McDonald and Alex Monte-Santo (both formerly with Amerindo Investment Advisors, Inc.), David Golob (formerly with Tiger Management L.L.C.), Tim Murphy (formerly with Capital Research & Management), and George Lee and Laura Paradis (former bankers with Goldman Sachs).  Unfortunately, the firm concentrated on companies with high revenues regardless of earnings.  (In many cases, the kinds of companies that have taken a beating in the market recently.)  The firm specifically invests in emerging growth companies within the technology sector. Using a fundamental approach, Octane seeks companies with high revenue growth, leadership qualities and innovative products. Unlike other sectors, emerging growth within the technology sector may include companies that have reached large market caps.  The public equity portfolio typically consists of 20 to 40 core issues; some of which are private investments that have since gone public.  In the year 2000, there was approximately $223 billion in U.S. common stock underwriting, up from $175 billion in 1999 according to Thomson Financial Securities Data.  However, much of last year's gain was a result of a high volume of new issues introduced in the first quarter of 2000.  More foreboding for firms such as Octane Capital- approximately 68% of IPOs were trading below their issue price as of the beginning of 2001.  Many analysts believe that Octane Capital is one of the many firms that will soon be winding down their operations and consolidating with other firms. Venture capital and crossover funds flourished throughout 1999 and early 2000, offering tremendous returns as a result of a frantic and euphoric stock market.  As the IPO market has suffered, so have the firms most closely tied to it.  ---------------------------------------------------------  J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. MERGE TO CREATE INVESTMENT POWERHOUSE  Throughout the past few months, the buzz on the street was the recent merger between Chase Manhattan Corp. and J.P. Morgan & Co., completed on December 31, 2000.  The merged firm operates under the name J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. with various deviations for the subsidiaries.  A global competitor with operations in over 60 countries, stockholders equity valued at more than $39 billion, assets in excess of $705 billion and a market-cap of roughly $83 billion, the newly merged J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is an investment management powerhouse.  The firm activities encompass investment banking, strategic advisory, equity and debt capital raising, credit, global trading, market making activities, operating services, wealth management, institutional asset management and private equity.  UNITED STATES    J.P. Morgan and Chase have complimented each other with various investment styles ranging from growth to value.  For example, Houston-based J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management- U.S. (formerly Chase Fleming Asset Management and Chase Texas Investment Management Group), is a core growth investor utilizing four equity strategies; equity income; America core; equity growth; and small-cap.  Research is guided by proprietary valuations and decisions are made based on company visits, discussions with customers and competitors and industry analysts.  The firm's analysts then make recommendations to the senior portfolio managers who ultimately make the final decision.  On the other hand, New York-based J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc., which employs an active equity strategy, is designed to outperform the S&P 500 based on a bottom-up GARP philosophy.  Internal fundamental research, systematic stock valuation and disciplined portfolio construction enable the firm to build solid portfolios.  J.P. Morgan places greater emphasis on normalized earnings and long-term growth rates and less emphasis on near-term earnings.  The firm uses a proprietary DDM to derive at a DDR (dividend discount rate).  The DDR serves a dual purpose, allowing investment professionals to rank each potential investment and determine performance for possible sell-outs.  Similar to the Houston office, a majority of the research is conducted in-house, with decisions made on a team basis between analysts and portfolio managers.  The combination of Chase and J.P. Morgan has enabled the firm to offer a wider array of investment philosophies.  As a result of the merger, structural changes have begun to take place and will continue throughout the next few months.  The Houston office of Chase Fleming Asset Management (formerly Chase Texas Investment Management Group) has exchanged the Chase brand name for J.P. Morgan and now operates as J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management.  The former New York office of Chase Fleming, previously located on 320 Park Avenue, has merged with the team at J.P. Morgan Investment Management, located at 522 Fifth Avenue.  Some of the equity analysts that have relocated are: ROBERT ZECH, who follows small-cap and private equity; CRAIG LEIGHTON, who follows micro-cap companies; GLENN GAWRONSKI, who covers small-cap stocks; CLARE HART, who covers media staples, transportation and media cyclicals; RICHARD ROYCE, who covers high tech - hardware and software and cellular/wireless telecom; DAVID EDWARDS, who covers small-cap and private equity, along with GARY SCHNIEROW, who follows small-cap and micro-cap stocks.  The portfolio managers are as follows:  T. GARY LIBERMAN, who follows high tech - hardware and software; CHRISTOPHER JONES, who follows health care and consumer cyclicals; ANTHONY GIFFORD, who covers consumer staples and communication services; TIMOTHY PARTON, who covers transportation, business staples, business cyclicals, non-bank financials, financials (diversified) and services (employment, payroll process, facilities/environmental); EYTAN SHAPIRO, who covers machinery, media staples and media cyclicals, MICHEAL FOSS, who covers food & beverages, and computer services; along with JONATHAN SIMON who covers real estate, non-bank financials, financial (diversified), insurance (life/health, property-casualty and multi-line).  As a result of the merger between J.P. Morgan & Chase, the December 31, 2000 filing is a combination of approximately 32 institutions. J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Morgan Guaranty, Chase Fleming, and Chase Asset Management (now J.P. Morgan Private Bank) are among the entities now included in this filing.  UNITED KINGDOM  Numerous changes have occurred at the London offices J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management U.K. Ltd. as well.  The firm also dropped the use of the Chase brand name, as both the J.P. Morgan and Fleming brand names carried the most cache in much of the U.K.  Following the merger of Chase and Fleming, Chase Fleming moved to a new office at 10 Aldermanbury from its old Copthall Avenue location in September 2000.  While the merger between J.P. Morgan and Chase was completed at the beginning of the year, the firms did not combine physically until late April 2001.  Following the merger with J.P. Morgan, the former Chase Fleming made yet another move to Finsbury Dials, its current location.  The combined firm, J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Mgmt. U.K. Ltd., started operating out of its new offices on April 30, 2001. The former J.P. Morgan entity also changed its location, moving from King St. to join its sister staff at Finsbury Dials.  However, the combined location has not led to a combined investment staff and investment approach.  Despite their common location and common name (J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Mgmt. U.K. Ltd.), the former Chase Fleming and J.P. Morgan entities continue to operate as separate entities.  MARTIN PORTER has remained as the chief investment officer at the former Fleming entity, while PABLO FORERO remains chief investment officer of the former J.P. Morgan entity.  The reasons for the separation lie in the firm's divergent client base.  Each institution had too many large institutional clients that both sides feared an exodus of clients if a particular service or investment approach were changed too much.  Already, former Fleming and Chase brand names are being purged from the firm's mutual fund line-up.  After first adding Chase to many of its funds, the name will no longer be used along with former Fleming brand Save & Prosper.  The former J.P. Morgan does not run any U.K. retail funds at the moment, but may plan too, perhaps borrowing Fleming's distribution and style.  The former J.P. Morgan entity uses an investment approach similar to its stateside relative, using the proprietary DDM model.  The DDM is used to calculate each company's dividend discount rate; companies are subsequently ranked based on their DDR.  The managers attempt to exploit inefficiencies in the market and purchase companies that are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value.  In identifying such investments, portfolio managers utilize fundamental analysis coupled with an emphasis on relative valuations.  Investments are concentrated in the securities of companies with the highest ranking within their respective sectors.  The former Fleming entity uses a larger, macro-economic analysis in stock selection.  The firm assesses economic themes and attempts to construct a portfolio of attractive growth stocks.  All overseas investments are subject to BARRA risk analysis.  The firm's model portfolios, decided on by a committee, are mandatory for all managers of discretionary balanced portfolios.  Individual fund managers have no discretion over market timing or asset allocation adjustments.  The former Flemings entity had endured some unfortunate investment returns as a result of its growth-oriented style. The merger with J.P. Morgan was widely hoped to help stem redemptions by large pension funds and institutions.  -----------------------------------------------------------  SECTOR COVERAGE: MONTAG & CALDWELL  Atlanta, GA-based Montag & Caldwell, with $26.4 billion in equity assets according to the 13F filed for the quarter ended December 31, 2000, recently became a new member of the ABN AMRO Asset Management family.

""The meeting has spilled o= ver to the second day with DPC to participate in the proceedings on Wednesd= ay,"" financial institutions sources said. The sources said Enron India mana= ging director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGregor were likely to p= articipate in the second day of the meeting. They said the meeting, which w= ent on for over an hour, discussed the ongoing financial and legal disputes=  between DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. ""Nothing has been=  finalised as yet,"" they said when asked whether both the Indian and foreig= n lenders were able to arrive at any solution for solving the current statu= s quo. At the Singapore meet, the lenders have come together to try and dif= fuse the tension and unite the two ""warring partners"" - DPC and MSEB.=20  The foreign lenders were expected to be updated by their Indian counterpart= s about developments like DPC's preliminary termination notice to MSEB, whi= ch in retaliation rescinded the PPA and stopped drawing power from the mult= inational from May 29. The Indian lenders would press for completion of the=  $3-billion project, as DPC has stopped commercial production and doubts ar= e being expressed for commissioning of its 1,444-mw phase-II, due on Thursd= ay. The Indian team is led by Industrial Development Bank of India executiv= e director R S Agarwal, who is also DPC board member, along with representa= tives of State Bank of India and ICICI. The foreign lenders include a conso= rtium led by ABN-Amro, Citibank NA, Japan Exim Bank and Opic. (PTI)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE TIMES OF INDIA, Wednesday, June 06, 2001=20 Lenders split over DPC transfer notice to MSEB ,  Pradipta Bagchi=20 Lenders to the $ 2.9-billion Dabhol Power Company are split over whether DP= C should be allowed to issue a transfer notice to MSEB. Last Friday, Enron = sought the lenders' permission--for the second time in a month--to issue a = transfer notice to MSEB. A transfer notice allows the valuation of all fixe= d assets to begin with and is the first step in starting the process of tra= nsfer of assets to the MSEB. While domestic lenders like IDBI, ICICI and SB= I--with an exposure of more than Rs 5,000 crore to the project--are opposin= g the move to issue a transfer notice, most foreign lenders including the l= ead arrangers to the project are now agreeable to the transfer notice being=  issued by the DPC. On the first day of lenders' deliberations in Singapore= , vast differences emerged between the domestic and foreign lenders in this=  regard.=20 While domestic lenders are worried about the impact of the huge exposure on=  their balance sheets, foreign lenders, who typically have smaller exposure= , are of the opinion that without any alternative concrete solutions, it ma= y be worthwhile to pull the plug on the project. ``Without any concrete sol= utions and no fixed time-frame, foreign lenders are not willing to go to th= eir respective credit committees for further disbursals,'' a lender from Si= ngapore told The Times of India. ``There is no point throwing more good mon= ey after bad, is the consensus among foreign lenders,'' said the lender.=20 Among other issues discussed on the first day of the meetings was whether t= he lenders should throw Enron out of the project and take over the operatio= ns of DPC. However, without a proper team of skilled managers in place, it = is unlikely that the lenders will risk throwing out the current operators. = Fresh disbursals from the lenders are unlikely. Among the first casualties = will be an Enron affiliate company, which is the EPC contractor for the LNG=  terminal. On June 8, a payment of $ 13 million is to be made to the LNG co= ntractor, which will not be disbursed by the lenders. Another big payment o= f $ 25 million has to be made to Bechtel, the EPC contractor for the power = plant, by June 18 as well.=20 Enron and DPC officials will make a presentation on Wednesday to the banker= s, following which, further deliberations will be held among the lending ba= nks.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE INDIAN EXPRESS, Wednesday, June 06, 2001=20 DPC lenders meet opens on a positive note  The first day of the crucial meeting between the Indian and international l= enders in Singapore has opened on a positive note with the foreign lenders = showing signs of giving more time to Indian government to resolve the probl= em.=20  Foreign lenders are enthused by the fact that the Centre is ready to give i= ncentives to the project so that DPC can reduce its tariff. The Centre' pac= kage include cutting interest rate on the project, and asking the Central E= lectricity Authority (CEA) to work out a contingency plan for sale of power=  to other States from the Dabhol power project.''The international lenders = are ready to give some more time to find out a solution. Lenders will take = the maximum hit if the Enron pulls the plug into the project,'' FI sources = said. Hence, the rethinking among the international lenders. The Centre's p= ackage, to be ready in another two months, would also lower the customs dut= y on imported LNG which would further help the company to lower the tariff.  Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGregor = are likely to participate in the second day of the meeting on Wednesday to = present their side of the story. Tuesday's meeting, which went on for over = an hour, discussed the on-going financial and legal disputes between DPC an= d its partner Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).At the meet, the l= enders have come together to try and diffuse escalated tension and unite th= e two warring partners, DPC and MSEB, say FI sources.=20  While loans from international FIs enjoy the Indian government guarantee, i= t would be Indian FIs which will have to take the maximum hit if the projec= t gets derailed. On Tuesday, the foreign lenders were updated by the Indian=  counterparts over series of events like DPC's Preliminary Termination Noti= ce to MSEB, which in retaliation rescinded the PPA and stopped drawing powe= r from the multinational from May 29. The Indian team is led by Industrial = Development Bank of India (IDBI) executive director R S Agarwal, who is als= o DPC board member, along with representatives of State Bank of India and I= CICI. The foreign lenders include a consortium led by ABN-Amro, Citibank NA= , Japan Exim bank and OPIC.=20  Sanjay Jog=20  The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has launched an exercise to assess=  the viability of despatch of Dabhol power to various power deficit states = across the country, announced the Union minister of state for power Jayavan= tiben on Tuesday. Mehta said that the CEA, which has been asked to undertak= e this exercise recently, will take into account the burden to be borne by = various power deficit states during the despatch of power. Currently, if th= e power has to be transported from eastern grid to western grid, there is c= ertain fixed charge imposed on it. ""The CEA will have to carry out this exe= rcise at length so that the exact picture will emerge whether or not the Da= bhol power despatch is viable and whether the states are keen to purchase t= hat power,"" the minister added.

The Indian team was lead = by Mr RS Agarwal, IDBI executive director, along with the other officials f= rom other lending institutions including those from the SBI and ICICI.Appar= ently, the IFIs, on Tuesday revived their efforts to convince DPC's offshor= e lenders to maintain ""restraint"" to save the Dabhol project. The meeting b= etween the IFIs and their foreign counterparts remained inconclussive on Tu= esday. The foreign lenders are expected to take a clear stand on Wednesday.  Interestingly, the meeting is expected to be participated by members of the=  DPC on the second day, said financial institutions sources. The sources sa= id, Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGre= gor are likely to participate in the second day of the meeting. The meeting=  was also attended by a consortium led by ABN-Amro, Citibank NA, Japan Exim=  Bank and OPIC. According to sources in IDBI: ""The foreign lenders have giv= en us a patient hearing to our views suggesting that they should not precip= itate the crisis by any of their further moves."" The sources said the IFIs = are determined to take up the issue of completion of the Dabhol phase-II in=  view of 90 per cent of its completion. ""The IDBI has recieved a mandate fr= om the government that an all-out effort be made to save the Dabhol project= ,"" the sources added.  The offshore lenders are believed to have sought various details with refer= ence to the payment guarantees from the Maharashtra State Electricity Board=  (MSEB) as well as fulfilment of contractual obligations in the wake of rev= oking of the power purchase agreement. The IFIs are likely to press for the=  revocation of suspension of loan disbursement by offshore lenders so that = phase-II be completed. The offshore lenders had suspended loan disbursement=  after the DPC board meeting of London on April 25.=20  --------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- BUSINESS STANDARD, Wednesday, June 06, 2001 MSEB refuses DPC power at 90% PLF, Renni Abraham  The Maharashtra government will not buy power from the first phase of the = Dabhol Power Company's (DPC) project at a 90 per cent plant load factor (PL= F), a senior state government official said here today. The statement repre= sents a hardening of Maharashtra's position on talks with DPC and virtually=  kills the latter's proposal to split tariffs for the Centre and Maharashtr= a. The Maharashtra State Electri- city Board (MSEB) is now required to buy = 90 per cent of the power generated by the first phase (740 mw) of the proje= ct. But during negotiations with the Godbole Committee, it has been demandi= ng that the requirement be cut to 35 per cent. At the last Godbole Committe= e meeting, DPC had put forward a plan to split tariffs for the Centre and M= aharashtra, with the Centre paying Rs 3.30 per unit of power and MSEB payin= g Rs 3.50.=20 The Centre, DPC suggested, could buy two-thirds of the power it generated, = once the second phase (1,444 mw, taking the total capacity to 2,184 mw) was=  completed. Maharashtra's latest position undermines DPC's proposal since t= he Enron-promoted company's tariff hinges on MSEB absorbing 90 per cent of = the power it generates in the first phase. A senior state government offici= al said: ""The Centre has been talking a lot about playing the role of a fac= ilitator. What we need is a buyer for the second phase."" Despite recent cen= tral government pronouncements, state government officials privately argue = that the Centre is not playing an active role in resolving the problems tha= t have plagued the DPC project. At the very first Godbole Committee meeting=  he attended, the Centre's nominee, AV Gokak, adopted a non-committal stand= . The Maharashtra government official added: ""Gokak said he was merely atte= nding the meeting in the capacity of a messenger and would communicate to t= he Centre any solution worked out by the renegotiation committee. The Union=  power ministry has stated that a solution worked out by the renegotiation = committee would be acceptable to it. Unless the Centre takes an active part=  and assures the offtake of the second phase, no solution can be worked out= .""  --------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Wednesday, June 06, 2001=20 Dabhol says ready to extend conciliation , Shaji Vikraman , Balaji C. Mouli= =20  THE Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has accepted the Finance Ministry's proposal=  for a two months' extension for the conciliation process. The extension wi= ll be effective from June 7. This development is perceived by the Governmen= t as a positive signal as it offers more leeway to work out a solution to r= esolve the Dabhol crisis. DPC's nod for an extension, which was communicate= d to the Finance Secretary on Monday, is subject to the Government acceding=  to the company's stand on the ongoing arbitration proceedings. The company=  has said that it would continue to pursue the arbitration proceedings whic= h have already been initiated by the company, according to senior Ministry = officials. Under the power purchase agreement (PPA), conciliation and arbit= ration are two methods under the contract to resolve disputes between the t= wo parties. Normally, arbitration is resorted to only after conciliation fa= ils. However, in this case, DPC has dragged MSEB to the arbitration forum e= ven as the conciliation process is being pursued.=20  DPC has already slapped three arbitration notices on the Maharashtra State = Electricity Board (MSEB). The first notice was issued to the board for its = failure to honour the December 2000 bill of Rs 102 crore and the January 20= 01 bill of Rs 111.6 crore while two other notices were for failures to hono= ur the Maharashtra Government's State support agreement and the supplementa= ry State support agreement. The conciliation process was adopted in the wak= e of the dispute arising over the settlement of DPC's December bills of Rs = 102 crore, followed by the MSEB's counter claim of Rs 400 crore for the sam= e period.=20  The conciliation process was agreed upon on April 7 and was to be concluded=  in two months. However, simultaneously, arbitration proceedings were trigg= ered between DPC and MSEB. With the conciliation process making little head= way, the Finance Ministry sought an additional two months time for concludi= ng the process. Prior to that, the Attorney General's interpretation of the=  MSEB-DPC contract was that the payment could be made to DPC only if the bi= ll was undisputed. Hence, the Centre decided to opt for the conciliation pr= ocess.=20  During recent meetings between the Government and the DPC officials, the la= tter had pointed out that if the Government was able to work out a package = in six months, it would withdraw its termination notice and reamin in the p= roject for up to a year. The Finance Ministry officials feel that the Centr= e has been dragged into the DPC controversy well beyond its contractual obl= igation. ``The Centre's involvement in DPC-MSEB issue is restricted to the = first phase. The fate of the second phase is entirely a matter between the = MSEB and DPC,''they said.=20  Analysts feel that the Power Minister, Mr Suresh Prabhu's words of hope to = defuse the Dabhol crisis are not grounded in reality. ``The Centre is totti= ng sale of Dabhol power to third-party as a key solution. However, first, u= nder the existing electricity laws, the Centre cannot authorise third-party=  sale since it is in the State's domain. Secondly, since it is a purely com= mercial decision, the Central Electricity Authority's (CEA) intervention do= es not offer any significant breakthrough.'' Recently, the Power Ministry h= ad instructed the CEA to survey the demand requirement of neighbouring Stat= es over the next two years as well as their purchase price.=20  --------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Wednesday, June 06, 2001=20 MSEB unruffled amid power talk , Dinesh Narayanan=20  EVEN as officials from various financial institutions and banks split hairs=  in Singapore on whether to sink or sail with the Dabhol power project, the=  Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) is cool about the entire affair= . Unlike previous instances when the odds were stacked against it, this tim= e MSEB knows pretty well that whatever happens, it will remain unscathed. I= f someone has to take a hit, it has to be the financiers and maybe the Gove= rnments.At the hearing before the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Author= ity (MERC), the Advocate-General, Mr Goolam Vahanvati, had said on behalf o= f the board that MSEB was being kind towards Enron when it rescinded the co= ntract for ``material misrepresentation''. One more step, and it's fraud, h= e had told MERC.=20  Knowing this fully well, MSEB has kept its cool throughout the altercation.=  It firmly believes that if nothing else, it can pin down the company on ju= st this one point at any forum. Enron too has not said at any point of time=  that it can actually perform as per the ``cold-start graph'' in the power = purchase agreement. In fact, it has said such performance -- making availab= le full power in 180 minutes -- is ``not possible'' by any such plant in th= e world. In a way, it was MSEB's defiant posturing coupled with the Maharas= htra Government's passing the buck up that got the Central Government to ac= t.=20  One thing evident throughout the crisis is that all the players are trying = to save their own skin. In spite of the developments, Enron has played its = cards close to its chest, and hinted to institutions at taking a hit on its=  returns only a few days ago. Even that, Mr Wade Cline, Managing Director, = Enron India Pvt Ltd, is reported to have told Indian lenders, would hinge o= n substantial give and take. Indian lenders have a genuine case in that the= y are the ones without any assurances apart from the plant itself. And, the= y are not in the business of running power plants. They cannot do much exce= pt try get the players to somehow shake hands. They had tried to convince t= he Government some time ago to get MSEB to activate the escrow and increase=  the letter of credit amount. But they were told off by MSEB which was in n= o mood to relent. Today's meeting in Singapore remained inconclusive and th= e talks will continue tomorrow. Tomorrow, Enron will make presentations to = lenders at Singapore on what it feels can be done to move ahead. Whatever t= he outcome of the meeting, MSEB is unlikely to agree to anything that might=  queer its pitch.=20  --------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Wednesday, June 06, 2001=20 CEA to assess viability of Dabhol power despatch to various states' ,   San= jay Jog  THE Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has launched an exercise to assess = the viability of the despatch of Dabhol power to various power deficit stat= es across the country, Union  minister of state for power Jayavantiben Meht= a on Tuesday. Ms Mehta told The Financial Express that the CEA, which has b= een asked to undertake this exercise recently, will take into account the b= urden to be borne by various power deficit states during the despatch of po= wer. Currently, if the power has to be transported from eastern grid to wes= tern grid, there is a certain fixed charge imposed on it. ""The CEA will hav= e to carry out this exercise at length so that the exact picture will emerg= e whether or not the Dabhol power despatch is viable and whether the states=  are keen to purchase that power,"" the minister added. Ms Mehta said that t= he Centre will not purchase Dabhol power as its undertakings cannot take th= e additional burden on them.=20  She informed that the Union finance ministry had in no uncertain terms made=  it clear that the Centre cannot purchase Dabhol power and sell it at cheap= er rate to the states, especially when these states owe over Rs 30,000 cror= e to various Central public sector undertakings. Ms Mehta said that Prime M= inister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who has been apprised of the present situatio= n on the Dabhol front, has assured that he would provide necessary assistan= ce, especially technical, to resolve the issue. ""The Centre is quite eager = for the resolution of issue and will provide necessary cooperation,"" she ad= ded.  Ms Mehta said that she had a meeting with the representatives of the Bank o= f America and ABN Amro before they left for the Singapore meeting. ""These l= enders explained their position and the amount involved in the Dabhol plant= . However, they also expressed their wish to participate in finding an acce= ptable wayout,"" she added.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ASIAN AGE, Wednesday, June 06, 2001 Gujarat, Up High on Power Reforms, By Rajesh Unnikrishnan  Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Gujarat are moving ahead with implementing reforms=  in the power sector, even as the reforms in Maharashtra have come to a sta= ndstill due to the Dabhol fiasco. Maharashtra was one of the first states t= o initiate steps for reforms phase-II, by appointing a state regulatory com= mission and going in for unbundling MSEB. Uttar Pradesh State Electricity B= oard and Delhi Vidyut Board are finalising plans to privatise transmission = and distribution, while Gujarat is planning to set up one more power projec= t with private sector participation.=20  According to State Bank of India Capital Markets officials, UPSEB is going = to float a new tender, inviting private sector players for power supply in = Kanpur region. Due to employees' protests against the privatisation, the st= ate electricity board had cancelled its earlier tender floated in 2000.  SB= I Caps had also short-listed four companies: L&T, CESC, BSES and Tata Power=  for transmission and distribution in Kanpur. The officials said: ""UPSEB wi= ll come out with a new tariff order for Kanpur by this week end and a new t= ender will be floated by month-end. We would undertake the short-listing pr= ocess by mid-July.""They said that besides this, the UP State Industrial Dev= elopment Corporation is also setting up a 30 MW captive power project for t= he newly-developed industrial park, Tronica City, in the state. Total cost = of the project is estimated at Rs 100 crores and BHEL is the equipment supp= lier for the project.  SBI Caps short-listed six private players for supplying power in three regi= ons Tata Power, BSES, Reliance Power, China Light&Power, AES, the AV Birla = Group and CESC. Two months back, the Delhi government had cleared State Ban= k of India Caps' proposal for the unbundling of DVB by dividing the board i= nto five separate units. The proposal envisaged three transmission and dist= ribution companies and two generation companies. DVB makes losses to the tu= ne of Rs 1 crore per day. Officials said the Gujarat, on the other hand, is=  focussed more on generation and the state electricity board recently propo= sed a 500 MW project in Mundra and invited a proposal from the private sect= or.  The project will use imported coal as fuel and the state will keep a minimu= m equity in it. There are two independent power projects in Gujarat: the Re= liance-promoted, 500 MW, naphtha-based Hazira project and the 500 MW, gas-b= ased project promoted by Gujarat Power Corporation. According to the offici= als, the unbundling of Gujarat SEB has failed to take off because the state=  government has not yet appointed any merchant banker for it. The governmen= t initiated the state electricity board unbundling around two years back.","Wednesday, June 06, 2001, http://www.economictimes.com/today/06infr01.htm DPC lenders' Singapore meet inconclusive The above article also appeared in the following newspaper: Wednesday, June 06, 2001, http://www.daily"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ----------------------------------------  THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Friday, May 11, 2001 DPC-MSEB slugfest -- Needed a conciliatory approach , Uttam Gupta=20  THE ROW between Dabhol Power Corporation (DPC) and the MSEB/Maharashtra Gov= ernment/Union Government has reached a flashpoint. At a DPC board meeting i= n London, the Managing Director and President/CEO were authorised to take a=  decision to wind up the project at an ``appropriate time''. Though the DPC=  team agreed to meet the Godbole Committee on re-negotiating the terms of t= he Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), things are far from clear.=20  The project's termination will place huge payment liabilities on the MSEB/M= aharashtra Government/Centre by way of compensation claims (running into se= veral thousand crore rupees), the aggravation of the power deficit in the S= tate, increased NPAs in financial institutions, adverse impact on companies= /units with business links with DPC, loss of employment and attendant socia= l problems. It may be recalled that DPC was the only project, among the eig= ht fast track IPPs that has seen the light of day. If this is also wound up= , it will have a debilitating effect on foreign direct investment (FDI) whi= ch has already suffered on account of policies and delays in various approv= als/clearances. Enron is currently implementing an ambitious project to set=  up a terminal for handling imported LNG. Apart from replacing naphtha in D= PC-I, this will be used as fuel in phase II which is likely to be commissio= ned next year. The project involves import of 5 million tonnes of LNG, 2 mi= llion tonnes of which will be used by DPC I and II and the remainder will b= e made available to other projects, including the fertiliser sector.=20  Due to a severe shortage of domestic gas and the exorbitant cost of other f= uels such as naphtha, imported LNG is a favourite considering its low cost.=  In the fertiliser sector, the ERC has recommended that all naphtha and fue= l-oil-based plants switch to imported LNG to improve cost-competitiveness i= n the emerging liberalised environment. LNG will also help gas-based units = feeling the pinch of short supply domestically. Against this backdrop, if t= he DPC power project is terminated, a major source of guaranteed offtake of=  LNG on a long-term basis will disappear from the scene. For, it is not lik= ely that the LNG project will be taken up. This will affect the overall ava= ilability of LNG, hurting the fortunes of industries such as fertilisers an= d power. The genesis of the present crisis lies in the high cost of power s= upplied by DPC and the MSEB's inability to pay its bills. It is the inevita= ble outcome of a cost plus system of power tariff -- both with respect to t= he fixed and the variable component -- incorporated in the PPA. The MSEB/Ma= harashtra Government signed the deal with eyes open and the Centre also pro= vided a  counter-guarantee!=20  Having consciously become a party to the deal, things need to be taken in s= tride. It would be imprudent, at this stage, to lay the blame for the conse= quential problems on DPC/Enron. Unfortunately, our side has adopted a confr= ontationist attitude, amply reflected in the MSEB's decision to lodge a cla= im for Rs 401 crore with DPC because the latter could not supply electricit= y for a  couple of hours in January. Considering that the termination of th= e Dabhol project will be detrimental to Indian interests, a conciliatory at= mosphere should replace the present mood of mutual bitterness. The setting = up of a committee on re-negotiating terms with DPC is a good thing. But the= re is also the need to avoid frequent outbursts, charges/accusations and so=  on.=20  In the circumstances, the vexatious problem of high cost power should be ap= proached in two parts. First, we need to carefully assess the role of the M= SEB/Maharashtra. Second, the need for necessary adjustment/changes in vario= us charges to reduce the tariff should be impressed upon DPC. Needless to s= ay, both parties should take that action concurrently in a spirit of mutual=   accommodation. We need to clearly understand that under the PPA, the fixe= d charges have to be necessarily paid irrespective of the quantum of power = drawn by the MSEB. For DPC Phase-I, these are Rs 1,050 crore per annum or R= s 87.5 crore a month. After the commissioning of Phase-II, the charges will=  be Rs 3,500 crore per annum or Rs 292 crore a month.=20  Depending on the quantum of the power drawn, the incidence per unit basis w= ill vary. Thus, at 80 per cent generation capacity of DPC-I, or 5,186 milli= on units per annum, the fixed charges will be Rs 2.02 per kWh. For both DPC= -I and II, at 80 per cent load, or 15,067 million units per annum, these wi= ll work out to Rs 2.32 per kWh. If, on the other hand, the offtake of power=  is only a third of the generation capacity, or 2,139 million units on an a= nnualised basis, then for DPC-I the fixed  charges would be Rs 4.91 per kWh= . Under a similar scenario, with the operation of Phase-II, the per unit in= cidence would be Rs 5.63 per kWh.=20  DPC-I now uses naphtha as fuel. On the basis of its prevailing price, the v= ariable cost component works out to about Rs 2.2 per kWh. Together with fix= ed charges corresponding to drawal at 80 per cent load, the total cost to t= he MSEB is Rs  4.2 per kWh. However, if the offtake is restricted to a thir= d, the cost would zoom to Rs 7.1 per kWh. From next year on, the entire pro= ject would operate on imported LNG. This being cheaper ($3.75 per million B= TU against about $6 per million BTU for naphtha), the variable cost will go=  down to Rs 1.3 per kWh. Together with fixed charges at 80 per cent, the to= tal cost of power will be Rs 3.62 per kWh. In the event only a third of the=  capacity is drawn, the cost will zoom to Rs 6.93 per kWh. Clearly, it is p= ossible to contain the cost of power supplied by Dabhol at Rs 3.5-4 per kWh=  if, the MSEB draws the optimum load. There seems to be no other way of bri= nging about a meaningful reduction in cost, other than a significant increa= se in the offtake of electricity by the MSEB from the present low level.=20  The demand-supply scenario for power in Maharashtra justifies the accommoda= tion of entire supplies from DPC at optimum load. For 2001-02, the total re= quirement is estimated at 70,127 million units. Supply from MSEB's own gene= rating stations and sources other than DPC being about 57,000 million units= , there will still be an uncovered gap of 13,127 million units, which is hi= gher than  the supply from DPC-I at 80 per cent load. Notwithstanding the a= bove, if the MSEB is not able to lift power at the optimum load, it is beca= use its precarious financial health limits its ability to make payments. Th= is, in turn, is because of supply of electricity to agriculture and househo= lds at subsidised rates and high transmission and distribution losses  (pow= er theft). Without tackling these two problems on a war footing, we cannot = easily come out of the Dabhol imbroglio.=20  Besides yielding benefits by significantly lowering per unit cost, the abov= e steps  will also help build confidence with DPC, especially considering i= ts consequential ability to optimally utilise generating capacity. The nego= tiating committee can then leverage this to seek from DPC a meaningful redu= ction, particularly in the fixed charges. Under the PPA, all liabilities to= wards foreign capital -- servicing of loans and return on equity -- are den= ominated in dollars/forex. In the event of the rupee's depreciation, this a= utomatically results in the increased burden on the MSEB. This is contrary = to established business practices the worldover and needs to be rectified b= y freezing all foreign currency liabilities with reference to the exchange = rate prevailing at the time of commissioning of the project. Likewise, with=  fuel cost, efforts should be made to protect the variable component of tar= iff from the rupee's depreciation. The DPC should be in a position to absor= b its effect especially considering that the actual fuel consumption is low= er than the norm used for arriving at variable cost.=20  (The author is Chief Economist, Fertiliser Association of India. The views = expressed are personal.)=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- BUSINESS STANDARD, Friday, May 11, 2001 DPC mounts pressure on lenders to terminate PPA , S Ravindran in Mumbai  The Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has stepped up pressure on le= nders to permit it, without further delay, to terminate the power purchase = agreement (PPA) with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). The co= mpany has reportedly told the lenders that there should not be any delay in=  serving the termination notice as the engineering procurement  and constru= ction (EPC) contractor Bechtel has threatened to pull out of the project on=  June 11. Bechtel holds a 10 per cent stake in the project.  The lenders ar= e, however, not yet ready to back DPC's demand.  They are of the opinion that phase two of the project should be completed f= irst. The MSEB decision to clear the April bill (Rs 139 crore) has also com= e as a shot in the arm for lenders.  ""Financially, phase two is 93 per cent=  completed while 97 per cent of the physical construction is over. The lend= ers want the project to be completed without any cost and time overrun. At =  this juncture, if the PPA termination notice is served, it will preclude a= ny further disbursements by the lenders,"" a source familiar with the develo= pment said. A DPC spokesperson declined to comment on the development. A fu= lly completed phase two will be in the lenders' interest as they will inher= it  the project if it is terminated.The lenders have first charge on the as= sets of DPC. A fully completed project will enable the lenders to find a bu= yer and secure a better  valuation.=20  Earlier, on April 23 and April 24, DPC had sought the consent of its consor= tium of lenders at a meeting in London to terminate the PPA. This meeting w= as held amidst the backdrop of  MSEB defaulting on its payments to DPC and =  the Centre failing to honour the counter guarantee for the December bill o= f Rs 102 crore. The meeting witnessed a sharp division in the ranks of the = domestic and offshore lenders. The offshore lenders were all for backing th= e DPC  move as their exposure is covered by the Centre's counter guarantee,=  if the PPA and  project are terminated. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Friday, May 11, 2001 Godbole panel can renegotiate PPA  MAHARASHTRA chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh today said the views held by E= nron-promoted Dabhol Power Company on renegotiating PPA with MSEB would be = conveyed to the state government by the Godbole committee, which is slated = to meet us energy major representatives on Friday. Talking to reporters aft= er a cabinet meeting here, Deshmukh said the state government had empowered=  the  Godbole committee to renegotiate the controversial power  purchase ag= reement on its behalf with DPC. When his attention was drawn to the reporte= d stand taken by DPC that its representatives would be attending the meetin= g convened by the Godbole committee as a mere courtesy and there was no que= stion of renegotiating PPA, the chief minister said the official view held = by Enron would be communicated to the government after the discussion. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- BUSINESS STANDARD, Friday, May 11, 2001 Third Front may seek probe panel on DPC project=20  The coordination committee meeting of all the Democratic Front allies in th= e Maharashtra  government scheduled late on Thursday night  would witness t= he presentation of a written  request by Third Front allies seeking the set= ting   up of a commission of enquiry to probe the Dabhol Power Company (DPC= ) power project. Senior Third Front leaders after a meeting held Thursday a= fternoon decided to place their thus far oral demand in writing to be prese= nted to chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh in the meeting.A senior Janata Dal=  leader said: ""The first letter that will seek the setting up of the commis= sion of enquiry bears the signatures of Janata Dal leader Nihal Ahmed, PWP = leader N D Patil, CPMleader Ashok Dhavle and Republican Party of India lead= er Sumantrao Gaikwad. Other leaders  who were not present for the afternoon=  meeting, though unable to pen their signatures, have also expressed their = consent to the written missive."" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Friday, May 11, 2001 MSEB, state want rebate issue resolved before arbitration, Sanjay Jog  THE state government and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB)   h= ave asked the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) that the question of payment of Rs=  401.62-crore   rebate should be resolved at the outset before any of the o= ther arbitrations are proceeded with. The state government and the MSEB in = their separate replies to an arbitration notice served by the   DPC said th= at such resolution of the arbitration between the DPC and MSEB regarding pa= yment of rebate for the misdeclaration and default on the availability of p= ower on January 28 would ""consequently have a substantial and material bear= ing on the outcome of the other arbitrations.""  The state government and MSEB said that the Dabhol power plant had the capa= bility to ramp up to   a 100 per cent load from a cold start within a perio= d of 180 minutes. The DPC, by an availability declaration declared its ""dec= lared baseload capacity"" to be 657 MW for each hour on January 28,   2001, = MSEB by a despatch instruction at 3 PM instructed DPC to deliver its final = declared   baseload capacity of 657 MW from 6 PM.  ""However, the actual gen= eration of power did not achieve the declared baseload capacity within the =   stipulated period. This failure on the part of DPC and its incapability t= o adhere to and perform according to the dynamic parameters and operating c= haracteristic entitled MSEB to the rebate envisaged under the power purchas= e agreement (PPA),"" state government and MSEB said.  They have further said that under the contractual obligations, the DPC is d= uty bound to compute the   rebate and to duly adjust the amount at the end = of four months block ending in January, May and September. ""The DPC has fai= led to compute account for and adjust the rebate for the shortfall in decla= red base load availability on January 28 in its billing statement of Januar= y 2001. Thus DPC has committed a breach of their contractual obligations by=  not giving the rebate to MSEB,"" the state government and MSEB have said in=  no uncertain terms.  The state government said that the DPC's decision to invoke state guarantee=  for the outstanding amount of December bill (Rs 102 crore) and January bil= l (Rs 111 crore) was ""baseless, wrongful and unjustified."" Moreover, the am= ounts claimed by DPC towards December and January bills are not due and pay= able in the present circumstances when disputes and differences have arisen=  between the DPC and MSEB in regard to the payment of rebate. The state gov= ernment denied that it has breached any of the obligations arising under th= e state guarantee, neither has it renounced and repudiated its obligations.= =20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Friday, May 11, 2001 Offshore lenders to skip Godbole panel meeting today ,   Sanjay Jog  THE representatives from Enron Corp, General Electric, Bechtel from US, off= -shore lenders and liquified natural gas suppliers from Oman and Abu Dhabi = will skip the Madhav Godbole renegotiation committee's meeting scheduled to= day. Instead, the Dabhol Power Company, which has already agreed to appear = before the Godbole  committee as a matter of courtesy without any intent to=  submit proposals with respect to tariff reduction, would be represented by=  the Enron India managing director K Wade Cline, DPC  president and chief e= xecutive officer Neil McGregor, senior vice-presidents Mukesh Tyagi and San= jeev Khandekar and chief financial officer Mohan Gurunath, along with a bat= tery of company lawyers.  Curiously, none of the other DPC board members comprising Enron, General El= ectric, Bechtel and   foreign lenders will fly down from Houston to partici= pate at today's meeting. Instead, the offshore and Indian financial institu= tions would be represented by former executive director of Industrial Devel= opment Bank of India AG Karkhanis at the meeting. Mantralaya sources told T= he Financial Express that Friday's meeting would be a ceremonial one as no = hard  discussions would take place. However, the state government and the M= SEB have worked out a combined strategy to press for cuts in the Dabhol tar= iff and equity returns linked to the dollar, and above all, the Centre's in= tervention for the disposal of Dabhol phase-II.  The state government and MSEB are believed to have said that they were not = against continuation of its contractual agreement for Dabhol phase-I, provi= ded the company agrees to rework tariff and share equity earning with the M= SEB. However, for Dabhol phase-II, the Centre would have to step in and bea= r liability. In a related development, state chief secretary V Ranganathan = on Thursday briefed the state governor Dr PC Alexander on the ongoing Dabho= l crisis at an hour-long meeting. The state has also written a fresh letter=  to the government, seeking its active participation during renegotiation a= nd for solving the Dabhol impasse. Mr Ranganathan is believed to have made = it clear that the state does not require the Dabhol power, except 300 MW or=  so at present against the contractual agreement for 90 per cent power gene= rated from the DPC. The chief secretary has also pointed out that the Dabho= l project, in its present condition, cannot be   sustained by the state gov= ernment and hence the Centre's assistance is quite essential.  Mr Ranganathan is believed to have stressed the need for a renegotiation wi= th the DPC to find out   solutions as the burden on account of fixed charge=  would increase on MSEB from June this year.The liabilities would increase = from the present Rs 95 crore to Rs 191 crore in June to Rs 238 crore in Oct= ober and Rs 475 crore in January 2002. The MSEB would have to shell out Rs = 544 crore at 90 per cent plant load factor in January 2002 to DPC. Mr Ranga= nathan seems to have told the state governor that these levels of liabiliti= es would be  unbearable for both MSEB and the state government.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Friday, May 11, 2001 Inter-ministerial panel to assist PPA renegotiations ,  Anupama Airy  THE Centre has decided to constitute an inter-ministerial committee having = senior officials from the ministries of finance, law, petroleum, power and = surface transport, for providing inputs to the re-negotiation group recentl= y set up by the Maharashtra government to  recast the state electricity boa= rd's PPA with the DPC. This decision was taken at a recent meeting between = finance minister Yashwant Sinha and power   minister Suresh Prabhu. This me= eting was convened to discuss critical issues pertaining to invocation  of = the Centre's counter-guarantee by the DPC.  According to sources, this inter-ministerial committee would also brief the=  Central nominee on the  re-negotiation committee. Appointment of Solicitor=  General Harish Salve as the Central nominee on   the re-negotiation panel = was likely to be cleared soon and a finance ministry notification to this e= ffect  was likely to issued by Friday, sources added. Sources also disclose= d that the finance ministry had turned down the request of the state  gover= nment that the chairman of the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) be made = a permanent member of the re-negotiation panel. However, it was agreed that=  a senior CEA representative  would be part of both the inter-ministerial p= anel and would also be the Centre's nominee on the  re-negotiation panel.  The re-negotiation panel was set up to carry out discussions with DPC for r= educing tariff from the 2,184-MW first phase of the Dabhol project. These r= e-negotiations would mainly relate to the cost of delivered power as also o= n the exact quantum of power which can be absorbed by the state in  the bac= kdrop of Dabhol phase-II nearing completion.

The finance ministry re= jected the DPC proposal and put the view that the third conciliator should = be appointed by the two conciliators named by the Government of India and D= PC.  Favouring appointment of an Indian for the job, Centre also rejected the DP= C demand that the third conciliator should not be a national of India or of=  the US, officials said, adding that such a stipulation (about nationality)=  is not absolutely necessary. Finance ministry conveyed to DPC that the app= ointment of the third arbitrator be left to the two conciliators or be sele= cted by an institution based in India like the Indian council of arbitratio= n or the International Centre for Alternate Dispute Resolution. Maharashtra=  chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said the views held by DPC on re negotiat= ing PPA with MSEB would be conveyed to the state government by Godbole comm= ittee, which is slated to meet US energy major representatives on Friday. M= r Deshmukh said in Mumbai that the state government had empowered the Godbo= le committee to renegotiate the controversial power purchase agreement on i= ts behalf with DPC.  Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government and state electricity boardhave refut= ed all charges levelled against them by the DPC in separate replies to the = four international arbitration notices slapped on them by Enron. The replie= s, which were dispatched to DPC on may eight by the state and MSEB, categor= ically deny the allegations mooted by the company, official sources said. ""= Instead, it is DPC which has to adjust the amount from the Rs 401 crores pe= nalty slapped on it by MSEB for its February 28 default,"" the sources said.=  The state government, which replied to three notices, including non-compli= ance of state support agreement and supplemental state support agreement, h= as said that ""since MSEB had already denied DPC's charges over non-payment,=  the question of the state paying on its behalf did not arise"".  Meanwhile, Swadeshi Jagran Manch convenor Ravindra Mahajan said the group w= ill be holding a seminar in Delhi at the end of May, in which ""we will take=  up the Enron issue with the Central government"". ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ASIAN AGE, Friday, May 11, 2001 'TALKS WITH ENRON ON TARIFF A FRAUD', Olga Tellis=20  The discussion on tariff charged to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board=  by the Dabhol  Power Company between the renegotiating committee and Enron=  will be based on  flawed, fraudulent and inflated costs, Centre of Indian = Trade Unions claimed on Thursday. Enron's former managing director Rebecca = Mark who negotiated the Dabhol power  project in the early nineties had off= ered the 10,000 MW liquified natural gas-based  power project with regassif= ication at 4.9 cents per unit. Dabhol has been charging seven cents, a clea= r difference of two and a half cents or an additional Rs 2,000 crores per y= ear. The Centre of Indian Trade Unions which is in possession of a copy of = this letter questions the very basis on which the renegotiation committee i= s going to discuss tariff and said it can only be vitiated and can have ser= ious implications on any negotiations.  Mr Vivek Monteiro, secretary Citu, Maharashtra told The Asian Age that ""fra= udulent and flawed tariff calculations provide the base matrix for corrupti= on on a scale unprecedented in our nation's history. A one paise increase i= n Dabhol Power Company Phase II tariff translates into a Rs 17 crores extra=  earnings. A rupee one difference in tariff translates into Rs 1,700 crores=  per year. It must be remembered that the power purchase agreement is a 20 = year contract. So if this renegotiating committee brings down the project s= ay by Rs 500 crores per year it would still leave a difference between what=  Dabhol Power Company is charging and  what Ms Mark offered, a difference o= f more than Rs 2,000 per year, which leaves a lot  of room for corruption.""=  So the issue as the Centre of Indian Trade Unions posts it is  ""how can yo= u negotiate on bogus figures? Therefore a judicial enquiry and proper finan= cial audit is where the whole process should start. Something illegitimate = cannot be negotiated upon,"" Mr Monteiro said.  Mr Monteiro said the cost of the project is as yet undetermined. The projec= t does not  have an approved financial package. As per Energy Review Commit= tee documents in the possession of the renegotiating committee, the project=  does not have any approved financial package. The implications on the powe= r purchase agreement of an invalid tariff approval are extremely serious, s= aid Mr Monteiro. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Friday, May 11, 2001 Power, populism and lost potential, Ajay Jindal=20  THE CURRENT Enron embroglio throws up two sad points: firstly, the power sector has achieved precious little in the ten years of = privatisation; and secondly, it is hard to figure  out how India will ever = really seriously get into a higher economic growth orbit. Privatisation in = the power sector was launched with great hopes in the early 1990s. The gove= rnment realised two things: reliable and sufficient power supply is a prere= quisite for industrialised economies; and the government on its own was inc= apable of meeting expected future requirements.=20  India has always been (then and even now) a power deficit  nation. Studies = constituted by the government in the early 1990s had shown a demand for add= itional capacity for about 10,000 MW per annum; annual capacity addition by=   various central and state government organs and PSUs  had generally been = in the range of 3,000-5,000 MW per annum. Hence, the government figured it = urgently wanted private sector to come in generation. Numerous schemes were=  formulated. Liquid fuel based generation "" a practice hardly followed anyw= here in the world "" was also designed; these plants come up quickly and gov= ernment wanted power fast.=20  Larger, conventional projects ""some with central government counter-guarant= ee like the Enron project "" were planned as well. The clearance process was=  simplified. Pit-head based schemes were encouraged and pit-heads found for=  such projects. Coal import was liberalised for those wanting to import coa= l. In short, government showed apparent zeal and innovativeness, something = it is hardly known for. Nothing much has come of any of this. Fast-track, l= iquid-fuel, pit-head based, or mega power projects "" all of these schemes l= ie by the wayside. Don't get fooled by the long list of projects awarded re= gulatory clearances or under the process of getting clearances.=20  What finally comes up is the key issue. Actual capacity addition by the pri= vate sector is less than 6,000 MW in all these years of privatisation. Ther= e is no improvement in the power supply situation in most states; it has on= ly worsened in some. The Enron controversy has probably driven the final na= il in the power privatisation coffin. It is hard to believe that any new gr= eenfield private project will ever come up for many years to come, particul= arly if it involves selling to the state electricity boards.=20  Financial closure will be impossible to achieve now as no lending agency or=  financial investor can be expected to participate. So we are now back to h= oping that the government sector and NTPC can measure up to the task ahead.=  The irony is that the government probably under-utilised the capacity addi= tion potential of some of its own resources while it focused on getting pri= vate players in. In the latter part of the '90s, the government did realise=  the going the generation way was the wrong path, improving financial and o= perational health of distribution was more important. Given India's vast si= ze, many states and thus  mane SEBs, and muddled politicians, this is a her= culean  task. Even assuming political opinions were all streamlined, distri= bution reforms would take at least a decade to play through "" remember, tar= iff rationalisation has to occur. With the reality that political masters w= ill continue populist policies, it is difficult to figure out when the SEBs=  will become financially viable. SEB losses are mounting with every year ev= en now.=20  So there we are, all ready to drive in a car with four flats. With a core i= nfrastructure sector sinking deeper in the mire (not to mention no progress=  in certain other infrastructure sectors as well), just how is Indian econo= my going into a higher growth curve? Unless reliable and cheap infrastructu= re is in place, Indian  industry will remain uncompetitive except for a few=  lucky sectors like the knowledge-economy ones. Going into a higher growth = orbit also needs higher rates of investment, some of which needs to come fr= om FDI. The Enron issue could also deter some future FDI, for example in po= wer distribution. A multiple whammy, indeed.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Friday, May 11, 2001 Dabhol: Back to the negotiation table , Dinesh Narayanan=20  MANY turbulent years later, when Enron sits across the negotiating table to= morrow, several people would remember the day it stepped into the ``liberal= ised'' India, promising power, growth and greenbacks. They would also remem= ber 1995, when Ms Rebecca Mark, the high-profile go-getter of Enron, talked=  out the ``sinking project clear out of the Arabian sea''. Undoubtedly, thr= oughout the decade it has been here, Enron has shown tremendous tenacity an= d stamina in completing the Dabhol power project. And now, just as the stac= ks of the second phase of the project were about to begin spewing smoke, th= e players are back at the table -- ``let's talk what's wrong''. This time, = however, Enron makes its ``courtesy visit'' to the Godbole panel knowing fu= lly well it can afford to talk holding an axe over the project. In 1995, wh= en the Shiv Sena Government cancelled the DPC project, Enron pulled arbitra= tion and simultaneously started renegotiating the power purchase agreement = with the Negotiating Group of the Maharashtra Government. Several``hard bar= gains'' later, the project was revived with a ``$330-million reduction in c= apital cost and a 201-MW increase in the gross output''.=20  However, nothing had changed fundamentally and most of the ``problems'' con= tinued to plague the project. The negotiation details were not available an= d only a summary report was given. Even though there were protests, and cas= es filed against the company, the project went on and things quietened for = a while. That is, till phase I of the plant went on stream and MSEB started=  paying through its nose for the power purchased (or not purchased). As one=  anti-Enron activist put it: ``The enormity of the trap fully manifested th= en.'' Inevitably, the board defaulted and that triggered off another chain = reaction. It has come a full circle to arbitration, conciliation and negoti= ation. However, this time around it appears Enron has the upper hand especi= ally since the damage wreaked will be most on Indian financial institutions=  and Governments. The financial institutions are going ape because they had=  committed funds to  the project, not strictly considering its merits but b= owing to political pressure, say officials. They say that the Government ba= cking was ``instrumental'' in their taking the exposure. They want the proj= ect to continue because that is the best way for them to get their money ba= ck.=20  MSEB is really cheesed off because it is caught between carrying out the ``= social obligations'' of those in power and the rigours of doing business in=  the open market. Adding insult to injury are the barbs of being inept and = unbusinesslike and talk of reform school.In the melee, the Centre -- the on= e player capable of making any decisive difference to the issue -- has main= tained more or less a studied silence. It is understood to be reluctant to = get too deep into the matter for fear of contracting another ``headache''. = It wants the other three -- the State Government, MSEB and DPC -- to thrash=  it out among themselves.=20  But they want the Centre to talk shop. Enron does not appear interested in = hanging around running a multi-billion-dollar power plant, even though it h= as consistently denied so. It also has not categorically ruled out the sell= -out option. The end-game is getting more convoluted with all the players c= linging on to even the pawns. Enron has already said it does not agree with=  the interim report of  the Energy Review Committee headed by Dr Madhav God= bole, which had suggested some workable solutions, never mind if they were = really tough. Enron is hesitant to compromise on its returns, institutions = cannot reduce interest rates beyond a limit, MSEB is adamant on ``going by = the book'', and the  Centre is mum. The going is getting tougher...the toug= h should get going. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE INDIAN- EXPRESS, Friday, May 11, 2001 Why disgraced Customs chief took 'secret' flight with Enron, Pranati Mehra  CVC probes BP Verma's role in getting DPC import duty cuts,                =        =20  THE controversy surrounding the Enron-sponsored Dabhol Power Project (DPC) = is taking a new twist. Details of how some Customs officers, including disg= raced former Customs chief B.P. Verma, allegedly helped the transnational g= et import duty concessions are trickling out. The role of Verma, former chi= ef of the Central Board of Excise and Customs who   is in judicial custody,=  is being investigated by the Central Vigilance Commissioner  for waivers r= esulting in cheaper imports for DPC's Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facility.=  The role of Pune Customs Commissioner C.K. Kaloni is also under scrutiny. = Kaloni rejected his subordinate officers' objections in extending duty conc= essions to the LNG facility that DPC was putting together. The subordinate = officers had taken the stand that the LNG facility is part of  material han= dling facility and has nothing unique about it to entitle it to duty  benef= its. Though the recommending authority is the Union Ministry of Petroleum a= nd Natural Gas, Kaloni allegedly took the support of a Maharashtra Governme= nt sanction to justify the lower rate of duty.  The Customs department had earlier denied concessions for the DPC's Naphtha=  SPM (single-point mooring) project on grounds that it was only a material = handling project. The dispute was before the Commissioner (Appeals) when Ka= loni allowed the concessions to the LNG project. This and other concessions=  by the Customs helped the DPC save around Rs 400  crore. Now where does Ve= rma enter the picture? Last year, Kaloni allegedly interfered in the depart= ment's efforts to add service charges to the value of the LNG equipment. Ju= st when the dispute was hotting up, Verma who was then DG, Central Economic=  Intelligence Bureau (CEIB), and was angling for the post of CBEC chairman,=  visited Pune, on an invitation from the Confederation of Indian  Industry.  While in Pune, he made a secret visit to the project site in Enron's choppe= r. There was nothing official about it. Immediately afterwards, Kaloni inst= ructed that loading of service charges to the value (of the equipment) be s= topped. Verma was accompanied to the project site by Kaloni and another ret= ired customs officer. Verma soon became chairman of CBEC. When contacted, J= immy Mogul, spokesman for DPC, said he did not want to comment on the issue= . DPC has been constructing the LNG facility for the last two years, includ= ing a jetty about two kms into the sea. The imported LNG is to be carried i= n liquid form to the storage tanks through pipelines from the jetty. After = regassification, it was to be  used at the plant. DPC had made no secret of=  the fact that only about 40 per cent of the LNG would  be used for the Dab= hol plant and that the rest would be sold to other customers. Enron's own s= ubsidiary, MetGas, was setting up the LNG terminals, and  therefore, in eff= ect, a separate commercial entity was benefiting from theconcessions in the=  name of the power project. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- AFTERNOON, Friday, May 11, 2001 MSEB workers' agitation against Enron=20  The Maharashtra State Electricity Board Workers Federation  (MSEBWF), which=  is affiliated to the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), has proposed = to launch an agitation aimed at forcing the US power giant, Enron, to quit = Maharashtra. MSEBWF vice-president, Mr. A.D. Golandaz disclosed that a cent= ral executive meeting of the federation will be held today at Kolhapur to  = finalise plans for the agitation against Enron. The meeting will be preside= d by the federation president, Mr. A.B. Bardhan.=20  Mr. Golandaz pointed out that MSEBWF was the first to come out against the = Enron project at Dabhol in 1993, predicting the consequences. It had taken = the initiative to form the Enron Virodhi Sangarsha Samiti (Maharashtra) whi= ch has been fighting against the project for the past four years. ""What we = had said about Enron has now come true. It is time that the Maharashtra gov= ernment tackles over the first phase of the project and hands it over to th= e MSEB. The agreement with regard to the second phase should be cancelled,""=  he said, adding that the agreement was totally in favour of Enron.=20  Drawing attention to the fact that the Madhav Godbole Committee has pointed=  out numerous irregularities in the agreement, Mr. Golandaz suggested condu= cting a judicial inquiry into the project. ""We insist that no compensation = is payable to Enron in the event of scrapping the deal,"" he said. Mr. Golan= daz further pointed out the high cost of Enron's power, which is presently = Rs. 8 per unit as against MSEB's rate of Rs. 1.40 per unit. He also express= ed dissatisfaction over chief minister, Mr.Vilasrao Deshmukh's insistence o= n continuing the project and stressed  that the federation would continue a= gitating till Enron leaves the  state. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Friday, May 11, 2001 Enron to relocate DPC managers abroad, Anto T Joseph=20  WITH confrontation with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board deepening b= y the day, Enron is starting the process of re-locating senior officials to=  its operations in other countries.

Bowing to pressure from IDBI, off-shore lenders have agreed to extend the deadline to May 25 for the Maharashtra government and Enron to settle the ongoing payment crisis. However, lenders are going to monitor developments on a daily basis.   Lenders who held a conference call late evening at IDBI Tower in South Mumbai have decided to postpone issuing the termination notice by a week. Many off-shore lenders of the $2.9-billion DPC are still in favour of issuance of a preliminary termination notice to the Maharashtra government. A preliminary termination notice gives six months to the government agencies to deal with the problems facing the project. It is the starting point of the process of terminating the project.   When lenders met last time in London on April 23-24, lead lender IDBI had successfully persuaded off-shore lenders not to allow Enron to go ahead with the termination notice. Lenders had informally agreed to lend time -- around two weeks -- to the government of India to sort out payment related issues. The Maharashtra government has, in the meantime, set up the Godbole Committee to renegotiate the project.   In the meeting in London, most lenders had proposed a dialogue between the government and Enron rather than going in for any precipitative action. Without the lenders' approval, Enron could not go ahead with its proposal at its board meeting held on April 25. In the board meeting, the company had authorised two persons -- Wade Cline, managing director of Enron India and Neil McGregor, president and CEO of Dabhol Power Company -- to issue the termination notice, whenever lenders agree.   The Indian lenders, led by IDBI, have continued to oppose the termination move. Termination of the project is expected to hurt Indian lenders since, unlike foreign lenders, their exposure risks are not covered under the government guarantee. While the phase II of the 2184 mega-watt power project is under construction at Dabhol in Maharashtra, and part of which is getting ready for commercial operation in June, the phase I that produces 740 mw of electricity has run into a major payment tussle with the sole buyer MSEB.   Indian financial institutions and banks have contributed around 60 per cent of the debt for DPC with a $1.2 billion exposure. The $2.9-billion project was lead-arranged by IDBI, and a substantial chunk of Indian debt came from IDBI, SBI, ICICI and IFCI. Of the $2 billion debt, $1.6 billion have already been invested in the project. More than 80 per cent of the phase II is already over, and Enron was expecting the phase to go operational by the year-end. The project, the largest FDI in India so far, was financed by a consortium of around 40 commercial banks -- including ANZ Grindlays, Bank of America, Bank of Tokyo and Citibank. Half a dozen governments including the US, Japan, Belgium, Oman and India have participated in the project financing through various state-owned financial institutions and Exim agencies.   The recent stand-off between the state government-owned power utility and the US power major stemmed from a payment crisis. MSEB had delayed the monthly payments of electricity bills from October last year and subsequently defaulted payments, claiming that the cost of power produced by DPC is exorbitant. It also slapped a penalty bill of around Rs 401 crore and is going to slap another Rs 740 crore on DPC for failing to produce electricity within the stipulated time period of three hours after the cold start. Enron India had subsequently invoked state guarantees, counter-guarantees, and political force majeure and then went on to invoke the arbitration clause.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE TIMES OF INDIA Friday, May 18, 2001 DPC lenders meet adjourned for today   MUMBAI: The on-going global lenders meet of Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) over allowing the multinational to issue a pre-termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has been adjourned for Friday.  ""Talks with the foreign lenders would continue Friday as Thursday's session has been adjourned,"" top financial institution sources said here. The Indian lenders, led by Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), on Thursday participated in the discussions with their international counterparts and tried to persuade the latter to restrain DPC from issuing the pre-termination notice to the loss making board, sources said.  Technically, the permission to serve the termination notice could be given if 4 per cent of the total lenders were in its favour. The lenders have been discussing the issue since Wednesday by way of tele-conferencing across the globe. DPC's foreign lenders include J-Exim, Citibank NA, and ABN Amro among others. (PTI)   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE ECONOMIC TIMES Friday, May 18, 2001   India asks Enron to renegotiate Dabhol contract   HONG KONG : INDIA has told US energy company Enron it should renegotiate its contentious power purchase agreement with the Maharashtra government, finance minister Yashwant Sinha said on Thursday.   ""We have suggested to Enron that they should seriously renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the government of Maharashtra, because there are certain elements in that power purchase agreement which can undergo a change,"" Sinha said.   Enron and India have been sparring for six months over payment defaults by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board for power purchased from Dabhol Power Company. A Dabhol spokesman on Thursday declined to comment on Sinha's statement. He reiterated the company's previously stated position that it is ready for a dialogue to resolve all issues, but a renegotiation of the contract is not on offer.   DPC has already held a meeting with a Maharashtra government committee and is slated to meet them again on May 23. ""Since the purpose of the meeting is only to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts, we will not present any proposal,"" Dabhol said on May 3.   DPC is building the world's largest natural gas fired power plant on India's western coast. The 740 megawatt first phase of the facility began operating in 1999. The plant's generating capacity will triple to 2,184 mw when phase two is completed next month. MSEB agreed in 1995 to buy all the power produced by the plant, but now says the power is too expensive, and is refusing to take the additional second-phase capacity. Its change of mind has sparked concern over the fate of the project. DPC has already issued a notice of arbitration, and last month its board authorised management to terminate the contract. A vote on Thursday by lenders to the project is expected to endorse the board's decision, a source close to the matter told Reuters.   Sinha said he had no comment on the vote. He also declined to reveal the Center's opinion of MSEB's refusal to buy the second-phase power. (Reuters) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Friday, May 18, 2001     Deshmukh convenes meet to discuss Dabhol crisis Sanjay Jog   Mumbai, May 17: Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has convened a crucial meeting on Saturday with state officials, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the advocate general and legal experts to take stock of the situation of the ongoing Dabhol crisis. Mantralaya sources told The Financial Express that the issues relate to renegotiations with Dabhol Power Company (DPC) like the proposed arbitration proceedings, the Centre's reluctance to purchase Dabhol phase-II power, and issuance of preliminary termination notice to the DPC are likely to to come up prominently at the Saturday's meeting. Furthermore, the meeting would also discuss at length the DPC's refusal to pay rebate of Rs 401-crore charged by MSEB for the mis-declaration and default on the availability of power on January 28. MSEB will complete the review of rebate payment by end of this month and serve another rebate of Rs 400 crore to DPC. MSEB and state energy department are likely to seek chief minister's intervention to take up the issue of despatch of Dabhol power from phase-II by the Centre in view of their inability to bear additional burden. In fact, the state energy department and MSEB were surprised over the recent statement by the union minister of power Suresh Prabhu that neither National Thermal Power Corporation nor Power Trading Corportion are in a position to purchase or trade Dabhol power to other states.  Moreover, the energy department and MSEB were of the view that the Centre, which has provided a Counter Guarantee for Dabhol phase-I, cannot remain as a silent observer, but should bail out the state government and MSEB. The chief minister's meeting is also likely to discuss the ""cold"" response from the union ministries of power, finance and oil and petroleum in reaching at an acceptable solution. Ironically, the Centre, which has decided to adopt a conciliatory route, has yet to prepare a reply to the DPC's notice served on April 4 for the non-payment of December bill of Rs 102 crore. Sources said that the state government would make a fresh appeal to the Centre to implement a common strategy in defending the stand of MSEB, Centre and state governments at the proposed arbitration proceedings.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  BUSINESS STANDARD  Friday, May 18, 2001 'Affordable DPC tariff must to woo third-party buyers'  The Centre should benchmark ""an affordable"" tariff of Dabhol Power Company's (DPC) liquified natural gas (LNG) based power, so as to enable the Central utilities like the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) or the Power Trading Corporation (PTC) to buy and distribute power from the US energy major, according to a senior official of Maharashtra government. ""Now that DPC is ready for renegotiations, why does the Centre not set the terms of tariff for the multinational's LNG-based power?,"" the official said here today reacting to a statement made yesterday by Union power minister Suresh Prabhu that the Centre would allow sale of power to a ""willing buyer"" if DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) jointly approach with a concrete proposal.  The Union government is also a part of the Godbole panel and the former should not undermine its responsibility merely by stating that ""we would try and offer all the help"", the official said. When asked if DPC and MSEB would be able to find a ""willing party"" for the US energy major's costly power, the official said, DPC was ready to reduce the tariff and bring it down to an affordable level following which either NTPC or PTC could source it and pass on to the power-starved north Indian states.  Last evening, Prabhu had said the Centre would give any status, including a mega project one, if MSEB and DPC approach the Centre for the same together. Prabhu had said that his ministry would extend its cooperation to the state government ""in every way"" to resolve the imbroglio between MSEB and DPC. The minister also categorically stated that NTPC could not buy DPC's power, as it was a mere ""power selling entity"". ""There was no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long-term power purchase agreements have been signed by NTPC with the buying states,"" he said. Earlier in his meeting with state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the latter had suggested that NTPC sell the excess power over and above the 300-400 mw needed for the state from the 740 mw Phase-I and soon to be commissioned Phase-II of 1,444 mw, to other needy states. Source: PTI\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  BUSINESS STANDARD Friday, May 18, 2001 BYSTANDER - Dangerous drift on Dabhol The Central and state governments have failed to manage the Dabhol crisis effectively, writes John Elliott  No-one seems to be terribly concerned that Enron's $3 billion power project at Dabhol, which is India's most high profile foreign investment, looks as if it is heading rapidly into a meltdown.  Even stories that Enron is shifting executives' families out of the country - surely the actions of an organisation that is clearing the decks for a showdown - attract relatively little attention. International lenders have suspended loans, and contractors on the Dabhol site are said to be withdrawing. This is no longer - as Suresh Prabhu, the power minister, has put it - merely the sort of ""dispute between a generator and a distributor"" that has happened in many other countries.  Sure it started out as that; but it now looks as though Enron plans to take its recent force majeure notice to its logical conclusion and withdraw from India as soon as it can. One does not need a lawyer to realise that Maharashtra has unwittingly been helping Enron assemble evidence of force majeure ever since demands for renegotiation or cancellation of the project came from the state assembly's during its noisy sojourn in Nagpur last November.  After that, the Maharashtra government stoked the flames by calling for cancellation and by demanding on three separate occasions that the plant should move from being idle to full production in three hours. That is a time limit that had never been demanded before and which the Dabhol equipment is not designed to meet. Then the Central government used this time-limit issue as an excuse for not paying Enron money that was due under the project's finance ministry counter guarantee.  This must have confirmed Enron's belief that there is really no chance of it ever being allowed to settle down at Dabhol to a normal business relationship with the Maharashtra government, the state's political parties, and the state electricity board. There is too much history and baggage - starting with the original project's go-ahead against advice from the World Bank and others, and continuing with the way that Bal Thackeray was suddenly converted to the virtues of Dabhol's second 1,440MW phase stage after he met Rebecca Mark, a senior Enron executive.  Then there were blockages on Enron's plans for broadband telecom and gas sales, followed by the Nagpur attacks, and damming statements issued since then by the Maharashtra government. Now the story is lost in a complex array of arbitration and conciliation, lenders' meetings, government meetings, and often contradictory newspaper reports. Seemingly forgotten is the basic fact that Enron's senior executive in India obtained authority last month from Dabhol's board to terminate the project if matters do not improve.  For him not to act on that, India presumably needs to show good faith that it wants to resolve all the disputes quickly. But insisting, as the state government has done, that the interim report of the Godbole committee of inquiry on the dispute should be the starting point for re-negotiating the power purchase agreement is scarcely a conciliatory start.  The best solution of course would be for Enron's 65 per cent stake in Dabhol to be bought out by a another power company which would then, with bankers and lenders, renegotiate the power purchase agreement, lower the rate of return, restructure $2 billion debt, and arrange to sell power across to states outside Maharashtra.  Many foreign power companies have looked at the project, which looks attractive because the 2,144 MW power plant is almost completed, whereas most other big power projects have not even started construction, and because there is a large liquefied natural gas terminal which will be one of the first in the country. But no foreign company wants to pick up the risks and uncertainties involved. That leaves the possibility of an India buyer - with Reliance being frequently mentioned as the most likely candidate because of its proven financial and management capabilities and reach.  But time is running out and it does not look as if Enron will wait much longer. If it does terminate the contract - and maybe puts the Dabhol company into bankruptcy - India's image will suffer because of the government's failure to pay the counter guarantees, which could well be presented as the central issue. The only beneficiary of this disaster would be the company that eventually picks up the pieces at Dabhol because it will obtain the project at a knockdown price.  This may sound as if I am arguing that Enron is in the right. I am not. What I am arguing however is that the Central and state governments have failed to manage this crisis effectively. Instead they are treating it with a characteristic sense of drift - assuming no doubt that, like so many crises in this country, it will solve itself - which it will not.  If anyone doubts Enron's motive for ridding itself of its India business, just look at its recent first quarter results: profits up 20 per cent to $406 million on sales that had almost quadrupled to $50 billion. Does anyone seriously think that Dabhol matters to such an international commodities trader?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  BUSINESS STANDARD  Friday, May 18, 2001   Godbole panel not to seek replacements Our Regional Bureau in Mumbai Chairman of the renegotiation committee appointed to hold discussions with the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) Madhav Godbole, on Wednesday said the remaining six members on the committee were adequate to fruitfully continue negotiations with the power major.  Responding to a query whether the withdrawal by three appointees on the committee -- EAS Sarma, RK Pachouri and Kirit Parikh -- would hamper negotiations with DPC considering their respective expertise in fields of finance and power, Godbole told Business Standard, ""I would not like to get into such an argument. As far as the committee is concerned we would not be seeking fresh inductions."" He was reacting to Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh's statement made earlier on Wednesday, wherein he said the government would wait for the chairman of the renegotiation committee to make a requisition for new members on the committee. Deshmukh also told mediapersons after the cabinet meeting, ""We have repeatedly informed the centre of our inability to absorb the DPC power that would become available following the completion of phase II of the project."" He also observed that while Maharashtra was keen to ensure the active participation of individual members from the Union finance, energy and legal ministries for a fruitful dialogue process with DPC, the appointment of retired bureaucrat AV Gokak was not clear on some issues. ""Whether Gokak is authorised by the centre with some powers to negotiate on its behalf is not clear as of now. However, with renegotiations currently on, we would like to await the committee's deliberations,"" he said. The next meeting of the renegotiating committee with DPC is scheduled for May 23.

This is a slight decrease from the previous quarter, in which the firm reported $1.9 billion in equity assets invested in a portfolio of 167 companies.  Top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001, included:  Arbitron Inc. [ARB] with 1,090,000 shares valued at $100.8 million; Philip Morris Cos. Inc. [MO] with 1,250,000 shares valued at $59.3 million; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. [GS] with 500,000 shares valued at $42.5 million; Waste Management Inc. [WMI] with 1,700,000 shares valued at $42.0 million; and, Orion Power Holdings Inc. [ORN] with 1,150,000 shares valued at $35.3 million.  The firm's holding in Arbitron represents the largest new position this quarter.  Other new positions for the firm include: Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. [LEH] with 450,000 shares valued at $28.2 million; Tosco Corp. [TOS] with 600,000 shares valued at $25.7 million; Amgen Inc. [AMGN] with 367,400 shares valued at $22.1 million; and, General Motors Corp. [GM] with 400,000 shares valued at $20.7 million.  Despite a quarter in which the tech-heavy Nasdaq's plunge seemed never-ending, the firm remained heavily weighted in the sector, increasing its tech holdings slightly from approximately 20.5% in the fourth quarter of 2000 to 21.7% in the first quarter of 2001.  Perhaps, the biggest change to the firm's portfolio was found in its energy sector holdings.  In the fourth quarter of 2001, approximately 9.3% (valued at $172.5 million) of the firm's portfolio was invested in energy companies compared to the first quarter of 2001 in which the firm sold approximately three times as much than it bought.  As of March 31, 2001, Kingdon's energy holdings dropped to 3.3% of the portfolio with a value of $50.7 million.  The biggest increases were felt in the consumer cyclicals sector, which represented 10.6% of the firm's portfolio for a value of $196.7 million at the end of 2000.  As of March 31, 2001, the firm's holdings in the consumer cyclicals sector increased to 17.4% of the portfolio for a value of $271.4 million.  This increase was led by purchases in General Motors, Ford Motor Co. [F] with 700,000 shares valued at $19.7 million; Abercrombie & Fitch Co. [ANF] with 500,000 shares valued at $16.4 million; and, Galileo International Inc. [GLC] with 724,100 shares valued at $15.9 million.  ----------------------------------------------------------  HEDGE FUND PROFILE: STARO ASSET MANAGEMENT  BRIAN STARK and MICHAEL ROTH met years ago at the prestigious Harvard Law School.  While both may have intended to pursue very successful careers in law, they found their success in a very different area.  After graduation, the duo parted ways; Stark moved to Denver where he handled general commercial litigation, antitrust law and intellectual property cases.  Roth, on the other hand, moved to Washington, D.C. where he handled bankruptcy cases.  It wouldn't be long before Stark would take what was once a hobby and turn in into his profession.  Investing had always been of great interest to Stark.  According to an article written by the Business Journal- Milwaukee, while Stark attended law school he researched and wrote a book on complex investment strategies like hedging, arbitrage and liquidation. This book was a culmination of his interest in investing which began at a very early age.  With the knowledge Stark accumulated over the years in the research and writing of his book and managing his own money, Stark took this experience and decided to apply it to his own investment partnership.  Founded in 1987, Staro Asset Management originally opened in New York and later moved to Mequon, WI in 1993. The firm manages the Shepherd Investments International, Ltd., Stark Global Fund, Ltd., Stark Europe Fund, Ltd. and the Stark Investments, L.P. hedge funds.  The firm expanded its investment prowess when it launched BayStar Management, which manages the Baystar Capital LP hedge fund.  Stark and Roth are joined in the venture by STEVE LAMAR and LARRY GOLDFARB.  According to MAR/Hedge, the fund invests in public companies through the purchase of individually-negotiated, privately-placed securities, relying heavily on investing in convertible securities.  Staro Asset Management uses a combination of top-down and bottom-up analysis. In the top-down approach, the firm uses proprietary qualitative models to screen a global universe of convertible and risk arbitrage opportunities. The quantitative screens evaluate a convertible's fair value, attractiveness from a historical perspective, and expected return. Qualitative factors considered include the fundamentals of the underlying common stock, short-term supply and demand forces affecting either the common stock or the convertible security, and default risk. The firm then relies on its vast experience and expertise to decide which of the uncovered opportunities are real and which are merely apparent.  The firm will purchase or short sell a convertible bond, convertible preferred stock, warrant or option, coupled with the respective short sale or purchase of the underlying security of which the convertible can be exchanged. Through out all of the firm's affiliated funds there are no restrictions or limitations on what sector, market-cap, or country the firm can invest in, thought it concentrates on the G-7 markets.  It uses the same screening and selection process in the bottom-up approach applied in uncovering optimal risk-adjusted opportunities.  The firm's primary objective is to achieve an uncorrelated, absolute return of 15% to 20%, net of fees. The primary strategy of the firm is convertible hedging, which typically represents 70% to 90% of overall investing. Other strategies are used on an opportunistic basis and will differ per fund.  In its convertible hedging strategy, the firm will take advantage of temporary mispricings between related securities to create positions that generate significant streams of cash flow.  The firm finds the most attractively priced convertible products in out-of-favor sectors.  In a shareholder letter dated May 4, 2001, the firm detailed its outlook on the global market, stating, ""We have continued to decrease our exposure to merger arbitrage and re-deploy the capital into other arbitrage strategies that currently offer much more attractive risk/return profiles.""  The letter goes on to state that, ""In convertible arbitrage, potential opportunities in the near term are abundant.""  According to HedgeWorld, Staro Asset Management has approximately $1.5 billion in assets under management.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------  SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISTS UP THEIR DEMANDS  Many activist funds have continued to grow as a depressed stock market has left many smaller cap companies with decreasing stock prices, making them prime targets for corporate raiders and management shake-ups.   Many firms are reluctant to become too active, instead trying to keep a low profile and involving themselves when they believe their interest is not being adequately represented.  Recently, Harvard Management Company entered the fray when a company it was involved in received a tender offer.  While the firm felt the tender offer fell short of the company's true value, it had to take it, unable to persuade other shareholders of its position.  Many socially responsibly funds have also increasingly used proxy statements to push their own agendas.  BP Amoco Plc - ADR [BP] recently faced a shareholder proxy that would have forced the company to phase out its production of oil and gas and instead focus on more environmentally friendly means of energy production.  The measure failed, but had a good deal of support from some pension funds and other institutional managers that have had a record of support for environmental causes.  In a 13G filed in late October 2000, notable financier Carl C. Icahn declared a 9.9% stake in VISX, Inc. [EYE].  However, Icahn recently failed in his bid to oust the board of the eye surgery equipment maker.  Icahn had repeatedly railed again VISX's management, hoping to elect his own nominees to the company's board.  Memphis, TN-based Southeastern Asset Management, Inc. has made sizable gains through its activist $3.4 billion Longleaf Partners Fund.  The fund was up 20.6% in an otherwise brutal 2000, and it was up 5.3% through April 30, 2001 according to Morningstar.  The fund is a traditional GARP investor, which also takes into account, the underlying value of a company in the event of a turnaround, or outright sale.  Stocks are purchased on current and projected free cash flow, or cash profits minus expenditures necessary to run the business.  When evaluating pricing, the firm determines a company's liquidation value, or the sum of what a company's pieces would sell for on the open market.  From January 6 to March 2, 2000, Southeastern Asset Management acquired approximately 8.47 million shares of Aetna, Inc. [AET] according to a 13D filing with the SEC dated March 8, 2000.  That gave Southeastern a 6.0% share in the Hartford, CT-based insurer.   Aetna had been battered in the market and many shareholders wanted to see the company spin off its less profitable businesses.  In that filing, Southeastern announced its interaction with other parties to determine the best way to increase Aetna's true economic value.  About 1.77 million of the shares purchased were for Southeastern's Longleaf Partners Fund.  ""In this situation,"" the filing reported ""Southeastern has had conversations with third parties, and intends to have additional conversations with these and one or more other third parties and/or the Issuer's management, regarding actions or transactions."" Southeastern typically works closely with management to determine the best way to increase shareholder value.  Aetna had received a joint bid from Dutch financial company ING Group NV and WellPoint Health Networks. ING was interested in Aetna's financial services while WellPoint was interested in Aetna's U.S. HealthCare wing. Southeastern's efforts were foiled, however, when Aetna sold off it's financial services arm, while holding on to its health care operations. Since then, Longleaf has slightly eased off on its stake, but still kept the majority of its holding.  Top five holdings for the Longleaf Partners Fund as of March 31, 2001 included: Marriott International Inc. New [MAR] with 9,966,000 shares (valued at $410.4 million); Waste Management Inc. Del [WMI] with 15,096,300 shares (valued at $372.9 million); General Motors Corp. [GM] with 5,000,000 shares (valued at $259.3 million); FedEx Corp. [FDX] with 5,615,000 shares (valued at $234.0 million); and, Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. [YUM] with 5,615,000 shares (valued at $217.3 million).  Other funds have also adopted more intrusive activist programs.  The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) believes that good corporate governance means the difference between short-term setback and long-term financial difficulty.  CalPERS spent many years simply reacting to situations, such as takeovers.  The firm has since taken a more proactive approach to investments in adopting its Corporate Governance Core Principles and Guidelines to achieve this end.  The firm believes that some measure must be taken to achieve long-term profitability, but that some investors may not be willing to wait out short-term difficulties.  The guidelines, however, are not absolute. CalPERS readily realizes that some firm's are constrained by competitive pressures, as well as a myriad of other factors.  The firm likes to see independent board members, and an open, shareholder friendly environment.  This typically means the banning of greenmail and an accessible CEO who is free of additional constraints and is capable of acting in the best interests of shareholders.  Most important, in their evaluation, is the appearance of an independent board of directors.  Hedge fund Wynnefield Capital Management L.L.C. has also recently entered the fray.  The firm's Wynnefield Partners Small Cap Value L.P. recently submitted a shareholder proposal to the board of directors at Airgas, Inc. [ARG]. The firm is pushing for the company to sell itself or to seek out new strategic partnerships.  The measure will go before shareholders at the firm's annual meeting in August 2001.  Wynnefield's top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 included: Sylvan Inc. [SYLN] with 1,068,886 shares (valued at $13.4 million); Pricesmart Inc. [PSMT] with 310,000 shares (valued at $12.1 million); First Aviation Services Inc. [FAVS] with 2,066,892 shares (valued at $10.1 million); Delta & Pine Land Co. [DLP] with 275,500 shares (valued at $6.6 million); and, CTB International Corp. [CTBC] with 723,500 shares (valued at $6.3 million).  Many companies' boards of directors are under increasing outside pressure. Growing demands on management from shareholders is increasingly an inevitable part of the future.  ------------------------------------------------------  SECTOR COVERAGE: BOSTON PARTNERS ASSET MANAGEMENT, L.P.

Sources informed that this issue was also discussed at the meeting between = Union power minister Suresh Prabhu and finance minister Yashwant Singh on M= ay 4.

Th= ese sources said that the per unit tariff had reached Rs 21.06 in January f= or the purchase of 53   million units. The MSEB has not paid the January bi= ll of Rs 111 crore on the grounds that the DPC should adjust it against the=  rebate amount of Rs 401 crore.

Padmanabhan=20  THE MAHARASHTRA Government recently announced its plans to renegotiate the = Enron-promoted Dabhol power project. In this connection, Mr R. K. Pachouri,=  a committee member appointed for the renegotiation, outlined the prioritie= s of the project in a television interview:=20  > To reduce the interest rate for the project debt of DPC to be in line wit= h the current market trends;=20  >To achieve higher output and identify power purchasers outside Maharashtra= ; and=20  > To separate the LNG project from the power project.=20  A business daily on May 2 reported that Indian Oil plans to supply 1.2 mill= ion tonnes of naphtha to DPC at around the international price of $290 a to= nne, including sales tax of 16-18 per cent per tonne. The report indicates = that DPC   has requested the Maharashtra Government to waive the sales tax = so that the reduction in the sales tax can be passed on to the consumers.= =20  Similar news reports on the project have started appearing in both the prin= t and visual media. These indicate that the State Government and the DPC ma= nagement seem to have come to an understanding on the broad principles of  = renegotiation and both are in the process of educating the public about the=   benefits these various measures would bring to the project.=20  No doubt, these steps would bring down the tariff. But, then, the reduction=  will be due to concessions and subsidies offered by the State and the fina= ncialinstitutions by way of waiver of sales tax and reduction in interest r= ate. It appears that DPC will not offer any reduction or concession offered=  in the tariff or the rate of returns.=20  Reduction in project debt: When the DPC loans were sanctioned, the prime le= nding rate was around 14 per cent and the power projects were offered loans=  at 3-3.5 per cent over the PLR. Now the PLR is around 12.5 per cent and th= e interest rates for the power sector will be 15-15.5 per cent. Effectively= , there  would be a reduction of around 1.5-2 per cent in the interest rate= . However, it must be noted that the same refinancing opportunity is good f= or every other Indian project. If the Centre permits refinancing for DPC, i= t should permit  projects in other States as well to be refinanced. If it d= oes, that will be at a  considerable loss to the FIs such as the IDBI, the = IFCI and the ICICI.=20  To achieve higher output and identify power purchasers outside Maharashtra: This is not a tariff-reduction exercise. In fact, this would help DPC impro= ve its profits and cash flows under the present PPA. DPC has a single-point=  tariff whichconsists of a fixed and a variable charge. Higher the output t= he DPC recovers, higher the fixed charges and higher the profits. Thus, wit= hout any significant changes in the existing PPA, this step would help DPC,=  and put more States in  trouble. Perhaps, the renegotiating committee want= s other States to sink as well  with Maharashtra.=20  To separate the LNG project from the power project: This is a welcome step.=  While it would reduce the tariff for the power project, it would not remov= e the financial hurdles for the State and the Centre, which would continue = to be paying more for the LNG project and guaranteeing the loans of the LNG=  project. DPC is now recovering all the cost of the LNG project from the Da= bhol project, which will consume only around 2.5 million tonnes of LNG, whe= reas the capacity of the LNG project is being upgraded to five million tonn= es. Therefore, the mere segregation of the LNG project without readjusting = the PPA or delinking the sovereign guarantee obligations does not serve the=  purpose. It would help DPC and not the people of Maharashtra.=20  To exempt sales tax on naphtha: This is like robbing Peter to pay Paul. As = IOC suggested, if $290 is the price of naphtha per tonne, it works out to R= s 13,630 (one $ =3D Rs 47). Given that DPC gets paid fuel cost per kWh at 2= ,000 kcal (heat rate) and the naphtha has a heat value of 11,000 kcal, one = tonne of the fuel will  give DPC fuel price for 5,500 kWh, that is at the r= ate of Rs 2.48 per kWh for  naphtha. If sales tax of 16 per cent is exempte= d from this price, the naphtha price drops to Rs 11,750 and the per kWh fue= l price for DPC drops to Rs 2.14 from Rs 2.48. IOC expects to supply 1.2 mi= llion tonnes of naphtha for producing 6,600 million kWh and the sales tax e= xemption effect will be Rs 225 crore (0.34  per kWh).=20  What is DPC`s contribution in this reduction? On the same account, every po= wer project would seek to reduce the sales tax on the fuel they use. Rememb= er that if the State sacrifices revenue in one area, it will recover the lo= ss through some other taxes. When the current trend is to remove subsidies = in all the sectors, the State and the renegotiating committee are opening u= p new subsidies to support DPC. An alternative The renegotiating committee = should reduce the real tariffs from DPC`s fixed  costs, rather than making = cosmetic changes in the taxation structure. The following steps are needed:= =20  To remove the corporate veil protecting the DPC project documents: The publ= ic at large are paying for the revenues of DPC and no government can have t= he right to keep a veil of secrecy on the documents. This will help the pub= lic at large and the experts in the industry understand the implications an= d suggest  viable alternatives.=20  To change DPC tariff formula from a single-part to two-part tariff: The Cen= tre has a two-part tariff policy which stipulates recovery of fixed cost un= der certain circumstances. The most critical issue of this policy is the re= covery of all fixed costs at a capacity utilisation (PLF) at 75 per cent. D= PC has adopted a single part tariff system where the fixed costs are paid f= or all capacities and, thus the return of DPC increases as the capacity uti= lisation rises. While this method may promote efficiency, DPC has tied the = State in tight knots with this higher capacity utilisation and, will make v= ery high levels of profits. Therefore, it is essential that the single-part=  tariff is renegotiated at lower levels or better still scrapped and two-pa= rt tariff adopted.=20  Renegotiating the station heat rate: DPC has a station heat rate of 2000 kc= al per kWh. Thus, for every unit of electricity it produces the fuel -- nap= htha "" it is reimbursed to DPC at the rate of 2,000 kcal per kWh. At $290 p= er tonne (Rs 13,630 at one $ =3D Rs 47) of IOC price this works out to Rs 2= .48 per kWh. DPC  uses GE 9FA machines-gas turbines which burn naphtha at a= round 1,700 kcal per  kWh. In other words, DPC uses 1,700 kcal of naphtha a= nd gets paid for 2,000 kcal. Thus, it spends Rs 2.11 per kWh on fuel but ge= ts paid Rs 2.48 per kWh, making a profit of Rs 0.37 for every kWh. On 2,100=  MW at 80 per cent capacity, this is a whopping Rs 550 crore. While there m= ay be technical grounds to pay at a level higher than 1,700 kcal due to con= siderations of part load, there is no justification for paying at 2,000 kca= l. In fact, the Centre and the CEA as well as other States have been succes= sfully forcing all power producers to reduce from the 2,000 kcal levels whi= le Maharashtra has not been able to do this. This is a  key issue in negoti= ations.=20  To source naphtha only from domestic sources:=20  India has a surplus of naphtha as of now and there is no need to import it.=  DPC should be forced to buy fuel only from domestic sources so that the pr= ofits remain with domestic companies, and not allow DPC to make higher prof= its of fuel handling.=20  What if renegotiation fails?=20  DPC will not agree to changes in the PPA as it would feel that it is a sign= ed and sealed document. Maharashtra may look at cosmetic changes, and may m= ake sacrifices to reduce the tariff. But in the long run, the contract will=  run aground because of the inability of the State Government to use and pa= y for the power produced by DPC. Given the background of Enron worldwide, i= t would press ahead with its perceived advantages -- legal and contractual.=  It is better for the State to ready a back-up action plan. The following l= ine of action is suggested:  * To terminate the PPA and other project contracts and give notice to Enron=  to wind up operations;=20  * To inform the lenders, the beneficiaries of the sovereign guarantee, that=  the Centre will pay up its commitments. Perhaps, this may involve setting = up an escrow account and placing sufficient debt reserve funds that the len= ders may request, pending final payments;=20  * To quickly move towards an arbitration process primarily to determine the=  amounts payable to Enron towards contract termination;=20  * To initiate an international competitive tendering process, with the perm= ission of the lenders, to sell the power project and the LNG terminal as in= dependent projects -- the process should also permit bids from Indian compa= nies;=20  * To make a serious effort to complete the bid finalisation and selection o= f the successful bidder in two-three months;=20  * The bidding process should have two parameters for the bidders to quote:= =20  a) tariff payable to the bidder for the next 20 years (in the case of LNG t= erminal  -- price of gas on long term basis);=20  b) price for the assets;=20  c) The bid would attract several international power players including Amer= ican companies for the power and the LNG projects and the bids offered will=  be attractive. Also Indian companies or consortia would line up for the bi= d;=20  d) Simultaneous with this exercise, as soon as determination of amounts pay= able to Enron becomes clear, to place the funds so determined and accepted = with an escrow agent acceptable to Enron;=20  e) To set up an investigating team to go into the approval process to deter= mine whether there has been any corrupt practice in the process of granting=  approvals. There is a Supreme Court case (filed by CITU) pending decision = on charges of corruption.

Talking to newspersons here on Wednesda= y, the Union Minister for Power, Mr Suresh Prabhu, said the Centre had alre= ady appointed the Solicitor-General of India as its nominee in the panel se= t up by the Maharashtra State Government headed by Mr Madhav Godbole to ren= egotiate the terms of the power purchase agreement. Enron's executives were=  due to meet the panel on May 11 in this  connection, he added.=20  Replying to questions on Enron's proposals to exit from DPC, he said that n= either the Maharashtra Government nor Enron had conveyed their desire to ex= it from DPC. ``We will support the State Government,'' he emphasised. He sa= id that the Centre was not in a position to intervene in the matter since i= t was for Enron to take a decision on the issue. However, the Centre's coun= ter guarantee liabilities in DPC would be confined to the extent of the Sta= te Government's payment defaults.

I have been given to understand that generally the COU or any similar document, as prescribed by the concerned Port Authorities, among other things outlines the liabilities of the ship owner in case of any damage to the port facilities while the ship uses the port.

The Board will file a case wi= th the state electricity regulatory commission on Friday. A retaliation to = DPC's May 19 preliminary termination notice, MSEB had with this notice lega= lly questioned the validity of the entire PPA, state government sources sai= d here. MSEB chief Vinay Bansal confirmed the development and said the noti= ce was served on Thursday ""rescinding"" the PPA and accordingly setting it a= side under law. ""We are saying that as per the Indian Contract's Act, 1872,=  MSEB wishes to consider the entire contract with DPC as void,"" sources sai= d. The legal notice for cancellation of the PPA comes in the wake of DPC's = failure to achieve 100 per cent peak load capacity in 180 minutes from a co= ld start.=20  ""We do not need to send a preliminary termination notice, this trumpcard of=  ours has entitled us to terminate the PPA,"" they said.

The sources said DPC had, in several lette= rs to MSEB and the state government, admitted that the multinational could = not ""ramp up"" generation as it was a base-load power station and not a peak=  one. ""As per the Indian Contracts Act of 1872, such a confession amounts t= o material misrepresentation of facts, which, in this case, has been knowin= gly committed by DPC,"" the sources said. On May 19, 2001, DPC had issued a = PTN to MSEB after months of working with the loss-making board, the state g= overnment and the Centre to find solutions, saying ""it was apparent that th= e first two parties are unwilling to honour their offtake commitments for t= he entire 2,184-mw power station"".

""We are now convinced that your conduct is not bonafide and as such w= e are constrained to avoid/rescind the power purchase agreement dated Decem= ber 8, 1993, with immediate effect,""  MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal said in a = strongly  worded two-page notice to DPC.  Mr Bansal claimed the company had made material misrepresentation and ""Our = consent to the PPA was caused, inter alia, by the  representation on your p= art in respect of the capacity and capability of the Dabhol power station. = In the circumstances, we are advised that  the PPA is void and/or is voidab= le at our option."" However, MSEB said that it was agreeable to continue the present arrangemen= t of purchase of power and payment till the disputes were resolved by the a= ppropriate forum ""so as to minimise loss and inconvenience"". ""For such  sup= ply, we are prepared to make payments to  you to as provided for under the = PPA, but such  payments would be subject to adjustments on the basis of det= ermination of reasonable   compensation by a competent forum,"" MSEB added.  The MSEB missive said at that all material times,  the company represented = that it would build,   construct, own, maintain and operate a state-of-the-= art power station with a Nominal Baseload Capacity of 670 mw, having a star= t up and loading profile that would reach full load within 180 minutes from=  a cold start. The   company also represented that the Dabhol plant would h= ave certain Operating Characteristics and   Dynamic Parameters.  ""One of th= e key characteristic and parameters of the Dabhol power station to be const= ructed in phase I of the project was that from a cold start the power plant=  would have the capacity to ramp up to 100 per cent load within a period of=  180 minutes,"" MSEB said. It further added that relying   upon the said exp= ress representation in respect of the Operating Characteristics and Dynamic=  Parameters of power station relating to attaining  full generation from a = cold start, MSEB consented to the PPA. Since commissioning of the Dabhol pl= ant in May 1999, the company has been billing MSEB for capacity payments ba= sed on the Rated Baseload Capacity for each Availability Period.    ""Until January 2001, the Operating Characteristics and Dynamic Parameters=  of the power station in respect of the ramp up capacity in a cold start ha= d never come into question and at no stage you disclosed to us any informat= ion in respect of the capability of the Dabhol power station being material= ly different from the contractual parameters mentioned in the PPA,"" MSEB sa= id. Further, on January 28, 2001, to its urgent requirement, MSEB instructe= d to deliver fully declared baseload of 657 mw within three hours.

In vie= w of these defaults, we became entitled to rebate as provided in the PPA in=  respect of the three occasions and claimed the same from you,"" MSEB added.  MSEB charged that the company, however, failed and neglected to compute the=  rebate or adjust the rebate in the billing statement or to pay the same to=  MSEB. ""In the letters addressed to us after January 28, you have admitted = that your power plant does not conform to the PPA and is not capable of mee= ting the contractual terms in respect of the crucial Operating Characterist= ics and Dynamic Parameters.

""Instead of cooperating in t= he matter, you have embarked on a campaign to create confusion and obfuscat= e the issues, which has involved, inter alia in wrongfully withholding reba= te payments, pressurising us to make payment that are not due, invoking gua= rantee issued by the Government of Maharashtra and Government of India, inv= oking arbitration, declaring Political Force Majeure, without justification= , wrongly seeking to activate the escrow arrangement without being entitled=  to do so and issuing preliminary termination notices on false and frivolou= s grounds,"" it added.

In a p= ress statement released here, Dr Pachauri has contended Mr Godbole's statem= ent that, ``The committee has also suggested that the judicial enquiry, hea= ded by a service or a retired Supreme Court judge should be initiated as so= on as possible.'' According to Dr Pachauri, this statement needs to be seen=  in the context of the fact that three out of the five members in the commi= ttee recorded their strong dissent with this view. ``Can the view of two me= mbers of the committee, clearly a minority, be read as `the committee has a= lso suggested...','' Dr Pachauri has                      argued. According=  to him, ``Can a judicial enquiry really force Enron back to the negotiatin= g table?'' In the press statement, he has thrown up several other questions=  -- Can the Maharashtra Government renegotiate a deal with Enron if a judic= ial enquiry is in progress, and would the public accept any such deal till = the enquiry is over?

Top government sources said they were wo= rking around the uncertainties in the naphtha prices. ""We are working towar= ds a rational tariff structure which will insulate it, to some extent, from=  the vagaries of fuel prices,"" a top state government source told Business = Standard. The official indicated that this could take the form of reducing = the pass-through component of fuel prices. ""We could try to get a lower pas= s-through, from the current 100 per cent,"" he explained.=20  Alternatively, the fuel component could be capped at a certain level to pro= tect the tariff from surging fuel prices. Fuel prices are an important comp= onent in the=20 tariff structure, as the entire component (in variable costs) is passed on = to the purchaser. Crude oil prices, which had touched a high of $33 per bar= rel last year,=20 pushing up DPC's tariff, had softened to $26 per barrel levels in December = 2000. However, prices have jumped over 20 per cent in the last few weeks to=  around=20 the $30 levels again. Power industry sources indicate this may cast a shado= w over the conciliation talks. While the 740 mw phase-I of the project is c= urrently naphtha-based, the entire plant is supposed to turn to LNG once th= e 1,444 mw phase-II comes into commercial operation. Naphtha and LNG prices=  are both linked to crude oil prices. DPC had earlier attributed the rise i= n tariff from the contracted price partly to the sharp rise in global napht= ha prices.It had argued that the rise in naphtha prices coupled with the lo= w offtake of power by the MSEB was responsible for the higher tariffs.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- BUSINESS STANDARD Friday, May 25, 2001,http://www.business-standard.com/today/opinion5.asp? GODBOLE REPORT, CEA's dubious due diligence  The Central Electricity Authority's role in scrutinising the technical aspe= cts of the project is questioned  The 'techno-economic clearance (TEC)' from CEA has been a controversial iss= ue. The in-principle clearance for DPC's project pursuant to sections 29 an= d 44 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 (the Act) was issued by MSEB on = May 20, 1993. The clearance was granted subject to clearance from the CEA a= s required under=20 section 44 of the Act. On November 26, 1993, CEA granted its conditional cl= earance... for the project after considering the technical aspects of the s= cheme at its=20 meeting held on November 12, 1993. A day earlier, on November 11, 1993, the=  Secretary, Ministry of Power, appears to have written to the CEA and quote= d an extract of the minutes of a Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) = meeting of November, 5, 1993 which said, ""...Finance Secretary has observed=  that the question of the cost of power has been looked into and it has bee= n found that it was more or less in line with other projects being put up i= n Maharashtra"". Accordingly, the CEA observed that ""The aspects related to = import of fuel, foreign exchange rules and deviation from Government of Ind= ia tariff notification indicting return on equity have been examined by FIP= B and the project has been found acceptable by them.""=20  On July 14, 1994, CEA issued another clearance for the project... stating t= hat all the conditions had been complied with. However, it reiterated two c= onditions stipulated earlier, viz., - Phase II of the project could only be=  taken up after MSEB/GoM ensures absorption of the entire power including o= ff-peak power in or outside Maharashtra together with the completion of ass= ociated transmission system matching with the commissioning schedule of the=  project. The CEA, as stated in an affidavit by the CEA in the CITU case, c= onsiders this to be the ""techno-economic clearance"" accorded to the scheme,=  which was based on discussions in a meeting held on 24 June 1994. The minu= tes of this meeting are not available to the Committee. Furthermore, it is = curious that the letter does not mention the word ""techno-economic"" anywher= e, as compared to a clearance given to similar IPP [independent power produ= cer] projects ...=20  Subsequently, on December 23, 1994, CEA issued a letter to Ministry of Powe= r stating that ""the cost of power has been found reasonable by the Ministry=  of Finance, CEA feels that since the cost of power is to be derived from t= he capital cost, the capital cost of Dabhol project may also be considered = reasonable"" In effect, the CEA said that since the Ministry of Finance find= s the tariff acceptable, the capital cost is reasonable, which accords grea= ter significance to the role of the tariff... In addition, curiously enough= , it makes no reference to the meeting of 24th June 1994 regarding techno-e= conomic appraisal of DPC mentioned in the CEA's affidavit. Thus, it is moot=  question whether the CEA discharged the statutory duty cast on it under th= e Electricity Supply Act adequately.=20  ...Modification to the project after renegotiations: Subsequent to the nego= tiations conducted by the Negotiating Group ... the CEA received a letter f= rom DPC dated=20 March 7, 1996 intimating certain alterations to the Dabhol project and stat= ing that these alterations were minor as per the first proviso of section 3= 2 of the Electricity=20 Supply Act, 1948.  The State of Maharashtra, through GoI [Government of Ind= ia], had sought CEA's views in the matter. The matter was deliberated upon = by the CEA and the GoI was informed that increase in capacity of plant and = use of naphtha in place of distillate fuel in Phase I of the scheme were of=  minor character but the removal of LNG facility from the scope of the sche= me and execution of the same by a separate entity in Phase II of the scheme=  was of a major nature.=20  Subsequently, DPC vide letter dated May 7, 1996 informed CEA that DPC was a= greeable to implement the scheme without changes considered as major by CEA= ,=20 viz. the removal of the LNG facility from the project scheme. As a result D= PC and MSEB went ahead with the project, without hiving off the LNG facilit= ies and avoided obtaining any fresh clearance required from CEA. It is difficult to compreh= end how MSEB agreed to accept the re-integration of the LNG facility, which=  was not in its=20 own interest.  The Committee finds it inexplicable why there was no mention=  of any reduction in capital cost of the project from $2,828 million to $2,= 501 million as=20 agreed to by DPC as mentioned in the Summary Report of the Renegotiating Gr= oup, which appears to have been intimated to CEA, as part of its economic a= ppraisal.=20  Neither is there any intimation about the change in the cost of power, due = to the renegotiation of tariff, which formed the basis for CEA consideratio= n that ""the capital=20 cost of Dabhol project (is) reasonable"". The counter-affidavit by CEA on Ju= ly 1, 1996 in the CITU case however states that ""since no cost increase (wa= s)  involved...fresh formal clearance...(was) not necessary"". This only adds s= trength to the suspicion that the CEA did not consider the economic aspects=  of the=20 project at all. Indeed, given the non-availability of any official record o= f the meeting on June 24, 1994 with the Committee, and the nature of this l= etter dated  December 23, 1994, the Committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects = of DPC were discussed at all. ...=20  Demand for power: As already mentioned, the GoM's submission at the start o= f the project regarding the need for power was flawed to the extent that it=  failed to=20 distinguish between different types of load. This led to an inappropriately=  high PLF of 90% being taken for purposes of calculating per unit tariff. I= n 1993, however,=20 based on the past growth of consumption and load, it was possible to argue = that a 695 MW plant could be absorbed into the system. This, however, compl= etely=20 omitted any consideration as to whether there was a demand for power at the=  price that was expected to be charged by DPC....=20  The subsequent error of calculation: However, this mistake pales in compari= son to the assurance given by MSEB, on September 2, 1998, that there was su= fficient=20 demand to absorb the power from Phase II. As mentioned earlier, the CEA cle= arance to DPC stipulated that ""Phase II of the project could only be taken = up after=20 MSEB/GoM ensures absorption of the entire power including off-peak power in=  or outside Maharashtra together with the completion of associated transmis= sion=20 system matching with the commissioning schedule of the project."" In respons= e to a letter from DPC on the demand supply position in the MSEB system, MS= EB=20 replied, establishing that there was sufficient demand. ...=20  The initial error of composition: The MSEB demand projections for justifyin= g the requirement of Dabhol was on the basis of the 15th EPS. The actual co= nsumption=20 in 1998 was higher than the estimate in the 15th EPS by 4.4%. MSEB therefor= e replaced the base year EPS estimate with the higher actual consumption an= d=20 applied the EPS growth rates to this higher base. On the face of it, perhap= s justifiable, until one looks at the growth of demand in the past. ... The=  actual growth=20 in demand in the MSEB system in the years immediately before 1998 were actu= ally much lower than the 15th EPS estimates. Indeed, there is a sharp slowd= own=20 in growth in 1996. This slowdown was completely ignored. While the actual c= onsumption in 1998 was indeed about 4.6% higher than estimated by 15th EPS,=  the=20 trend growth rate was actually much lower (2% in 1997 and 5% in 1998). As c= ompared to the growth of 2% and 5% in the previous two years, MSEB estimate= d an=20 immediate return to earlier growth rates of 8 to 9% ...=20  Based on these extremely over-optimistic assumptions, MSEB stated ""there is=  sufficient projected base load demand for power in the state to justify Ph= ase II of=20 the Dabhol project, even at a 90% dispatch. This was stated without an anal= ysis of the load curve. Indeed, MSEB in its projections before the Committe= e has=20 submitted that their current expectations are that consumption in 2004-2005=  will be around 67813 MU as opposed to 91202 MU expected by them in 1998,= =20 implying an overestimation of 58%! On the basis of this unconvincing estima= tion of demand ... Phase II of DPC was given the go ahead.=20  The World Bank was asked to review the project by GoI, for possible financi= ng. It reviewed the project extensively and pointed out on April 30, 1993 t= hat ""The  project (was) not a least-cost choice for base load power generation compa= red to Indian coal and local gas. Even if domestic fuels (were) not availab= le,=20 imported coal would be the least-cost option for base-load generation for M= SEB with current environmental standards. The unique features of this LNG-b= ased=20 project...offset LNG's environmental benefits over coal."" =20  The current design which would ""Dispatch the plant as a base load unit at 8= 0-85% minimum plant factor...would prevent the operational flexibility of a=  combined=20 cycle plant, (and)..the project would add more capacity than needed to meet=  the projected load growth in 1998 and would also result in uneconomic plan= t dispatch.""In addition, ""substantial adjustment in electricity tariffs wou= ld be required to recover the cost of the project from the consumers and to=  safeguard MSEB's financial position...Adjustments limited to special indus= trial categories would not be sufficient as their capability to continue to=  cross-subsidize, by paying more than the already high cost of LNG power wo= uld be limited.""=20  Subsequently, after further discussions, the World Bank wrote again on July=  26, 1993 to ""reconfirm (their) earlier conclusion"" and stress that the pro= ject needed to=20 be reshaped to ""serve higher-value intermediate load"", and that if the proj= ect was being justified on the basis that the existing system (was) project= ed to decline in=20 efficiency (and) most recently discovered slippages in MSEB's ongoing and p= lanned least-cost program, then it was better to take determined actions...= to=20 reverse this projected deterioration rather than accepting it as a given fa= ct in the analysis of new investments....=20  Enron was concerned. It wrote to MSEB stating, ... ""I feel that the World B= ank opinion can be changed. We will engage a PR firm during the next trip a= nd hopefully=20 manage the media from here on. The project has solid support from all other=  agencies in Washington. We will get there! We need now to put the PPA behi= nd us""  (emphasis added). MSEB and GoM addressed these objections of the World Ban= k by emphasising the environmental benefits of gas, reducing the plant size= ... and assuring the GoI that there would be power sector reform to adjust elec= tricity tariffs ....=20  In retrospect, all the concerns of the World Bank proved well founded. Refo= rm did not occur, the cost was too expensive and the system has not been ab= le to=20 absorb the capacity, even of Phase-I. In hindsight, it is always easy to ar= gue that the decisions made at that time were not justified, but in this ca= se these issues=20 were raised and dismissed at the time the original decision was made. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Friday, May 25, 2001=20 Will the lights go out on Dabhol II?, Anto T Joseph=20  WITH lenders, both offshore and domestic, refusing to fund the cost overrun=  of $400 million, the second phase of the Dabhol project seems to be in dee= p trouble. The US power major may now be forced to chip in with the additio= nal project cost, either in the form of equity, quasi equity or debt, or a = mix of these. Enron has, however, informed lenders that it would bring in t= he additional project cost only if the renegotiations look like making any = headway. With EPC contractor Bechtel stopping construction at Dabhol, India= n lenders are fearing a further cost overrun. ""It could be around $20 milli= on per month. If the project is delayed for a few months, the financial via= bility of the project will be at stake,"" said senior financial institution = officials. They said the huge cost overrun had become a major deterrent in = completion of phase II. When domestic lenders refused take any further expo= sure in the controversial project, Enron had scouted for foreign debt, but = in vain. ""Indian lenders, who contributed 40 per cent of $2.9 billion (earl= ier project cost), had earlier refused to take more exposure. Later, foreig= n lenders have also                                           taken a negat= ive stand,"" said sources.=20  According to FI sources, Enron wanted to maintain status quo in the debt-eq= uity ratio at 70:30. This would mean an additional debt of $280 million and=  an equity call of $120 million. With the minority stakeholders -- MSEB and=  Bechtel (they hold 15 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively) - having    =                                        shown their dissent in the project, = a new equity infusion  has turned almost impossible. In this situation, Enr= on will have to raise its stake from the current level of 65 per cent. ""Thi= s is an unlikely scenario since Enron is actually planning to reduce its st= ake in the project to below 50 per cent,"" said an Enron official. ""Enron is=  in a fix now. The entire responsibility of bringing in the additional cost=  lies on the shoulders of Enron.

The preliminary termination noti= ce issued by the cash-starved DPC has compounded the matter, according to F= I sources.

Thank goodness for that. For many years, India needed something lik= e the report filed by the committee headed by Mr Godbole. The Enron project=  has been dogged by controversy, allegations of goldplating and graft. The = initial power purchase agreement (PPA), signed in 1993 when the Congress go= vernment of Sharad Pawar ruled Maharashtra, was attacked by the opposition = which included the BJP and Shiv Sena. When a Sena-BJP coalition came to pow= er it scrapped the deal, only to sign another one in 1995. Then, the so-cal= led `renegotiation' was widely perceived to have been an eyewash that allow= ed everybody to save face but push the project through.=20  One year later, the only thing cleared by the first, 13-day Vajpayee govern= ment in New Delhi was a counter guarantee for the project. Five years later= , the same allegations are flying thick and fast. Given that, Godbole shoul= d stick around to finish a job that needs to be done. The report of the com= mittee headed by him points out serious flaws in the way the project was cl= eared, in the terms that successive governments in Maharashtra and New Delh= i agreed to and in project specifics.

Investigations to probe mala fide intent among everyone involved in=  clearing the project on the existing terms must  start now.

In 1985 he was inducted into  Prime Minister Raji= v Gandhi's ""Camelot"" and began shaping policy, setting the stage for the ec= onomic reforms introduced in 1991. Over the past two decades Dr Ahluwalia h= as pushed economic liberalisation sometimes as a General on a battlefield, = with his army of fellow travellers in different economic ministries, and so= metimes like a guerrilla using unexpected opportunities to plant an idea in= to a Prime Minister's mind. Through well thought out strategy and clever ta= ctics, Dr Ahluwalia has left a mark on economic policy making in India. Aft= er two decades in government he moves on to the International Monetary Fund=  where he will head an independent evaluation office, evaluating the Fund's=  policies, on a reported US$150,000 annual salary. Dr  Ahluwalia is not yet=  calling it quits to policy making in India, but agreed to give an 'exit in= terview' to The Financial Express.=20  You joined the government as an economic advisor in 1980 and have been clos= ely associated with   economic policy making for two decades now. The India= n economy had registered an annual average rate of growth of 3.5% between 1= 950 and 1980 and since 1980 it has recorded a 5.5% to 6.0% rate of growth. =   Was this acceleration of growth built on the foundations of what had been=  achieved in the first phase or would you take credit for your policies of = economic liberalisation and trade openness in the second phase?=20  I certainly would not claim that the acceleration in growth was due to my b= eing there! Individuals play a relatively small part in the larger scheme o= f things. I have no doubt that the policy changes which began in the mid-19= 80s, but were really accelerated after 1991, are major factors explaining t= he improved performance in the last two decades. In the 1980s, the governme= nt recognised the limitations of the earlier control regime but changes wer= e marginal. The controls remained in place but they were operated more flex= ibly. The 1991 changes were much bolder. They were based on a clear recogni= tion of the need for a system change. It was recognised that the economy wo= uld benefit from much greater freedom and the unleashing of competition and=  unshackling of entrepreneurial energy.  While 1991 did constitute a policy break, and there was an acceleration of = growth in 1993-96, the long-term rate of growth of 1981-2001 has refused to=  rise above 6.0%. So have the post-91 reforms failed to deliver higher grow= th?  We had a sharp acceleration of growth in the mid-1990s with three years of = 7.5% growth in 1994-95 to   1996-97. Since then, it is true that growth has=  slowed down. This deceleration is worrying and needs to be   reversed. I m= ust mention however that although the average growth in the 1990s may not l= ook much better  than in the 1980s, there is in fact a significant differen= ce between the two decades. In the 1980s, growth was fuelled by an unsustai= nable build-up of debt, internal and external. In the 1990s the external po= sition has actually improved over the decade. We have a current account def= icit which is quite modest in my view; if anything it is too small. In term= s of debt service ratios, we are now in a very comfortable position. =20   While the external profile of the economy has certainly improved in the 19= 90s, the internal fiscal profile is back where it was in the beginning of t= he 1990s, and growth has slowed down.  That is undoubtedly a major source of weakness at present. There are many r= espects in which the economy is stronger than at the beginning of the 1990s= . Let me mention four. First, freeing up the economy from the   draconian a= nd hugely inefficient external sector controls has contributed to efficienc= y and created self-confidence in external economic management. We now know = we don't need the extensive and highly   inefficient foreign exchange contr= ols and import controls we had earlier to manage the economy. We would  nev= er have developed an Infosys or a Wipro if we had not changed these externa= l sector controls.=20  Second, the unleashing of competition in industry has strengthened Indian i= ndustry. Industry circles often   show signs of nervousness and this is und= erstandable given the nature of change, but by and large I would   say Indi= an business is gearing itself up for competition. It may be a little too sl= ow, but the process is   underway. Every industrialist may not survive in t= he new competitive world, and this is an important cause of  nervousness, b= ut the objective cannot be that every industrialist will do well- only that=  Indian industry as a group will do well. I think that will happen with the=  right policies.  Third, liberalisation of controls by the Centre has given the states new de= grees of flexibility for attracting   investment both domestic and foreign.=  Some of the states have done very well with growth rates comparable with t= he best in the world. The negative side of course is that the weaker perfor= ming states have seen a deterioration in their growth. However, there is no= w a much greater realisation in these states that much of the problem lies = with their internal policies and they must take steps to improve their perf= ormance. Herein lies the real hope for higher growth for the country as a w= hole in the future. We don't have to learn from other countries, which is m= uch more difficult. We have to learn from our own better performing States.  Finally, we are doing very well in some of the new sectors as software and = IT services. The total impact may be small at present, but it has high pote= ntial (the present slowdown notwithstanding). More importantly, it shows ho= w well we can compete when conditions are right and also the potential for = new entrepreneurship.=20  Of course, the fiscal deficit remains a major problem. It is a first genera= tion reform which has fallen by the  wayside. There was an improvement in t= he first two years of the reform, but since then there has been a   steady = deterioration. The fiscal situation in the states in particular has got muc= h worse. Unless we complete this first generation agenda, the second generation reforms may get deraile= d.=20    Why is this so?=20  On the expenditure side there has been a steady expansion in current expend= iture at the expense of   investment. On the revenue side the tax ratio rem= ains below the 1990 level. We have also not done enough to raise user charg= es, either in the Centre or the states. The crisis in the power sector is a=  good example. The SEBs as a group have losses of about Rs.25,000 crores pe= r year. We have also not met disinvestment targets.  Would you say the political will to tackle this is lacking? Well, I am an o= ptimist so I would like to put it differently. These are clearly difficult = issues which can only be tackled over time. The major good news is that the= re is much greater realisation in political circles today that the present = path is non-sustainable. Six or seven years ago this realisation wasn't the= re, certainly not at the state level. There was a tendency to think   that = problems can be solved by the Centre giving more resources. Today, state ch= ief ministers know that their fiscal problem cannot be solved by the Centre= . Many states are even talking the language of fiscal reform and, even more=  important, power sector reform. Of course, talking is not enough. If some = states begin to move ahead, we will all begin to see light at the end of th= e tunnel.  So it is state chief ministers who must now lead reform? You are not hopefu= l that the centre will provide that leadership?  The Centre must certainly take parallel action in its area but I would not = call this leadership. Each has a well defined agenda. The central side agen= da has been clearly laid out in the report of the Prime Ministers Economic = Advisory Council. These ideas have been there for ten years. You wrote a pa= per which came to be referred to as the M-paper when Mr V P Singh was Prime=  Minister. Ten years later we are saying the same things. That paper did po= int in the direction where we have been going in this decade. It is not cor= rect to say that there has been no action. What has been achieved in the la= st ten years goes much beyond what was proposed in that paper which was aft= er all only a 2-year agenda at the time. Policy today has certainly gone mu= ch further which is good.  But that is largely on the external policy front and in industrial policy. = Public finances are where they were. =20  That is indeed the area which is weakest. But, let us recognise some gains = even on the fiscal front. We have made great progress in rationalising the = tax system, by creating incentives for people to be more honest. Tax ratios=  to GDP for personal and corporate taxation have improved though they are s= till too low. The main reason why the tax ratio has not improved is that th= e decline in customs revenue, which was to be expected, has not been matche= d by an offsetting increase in revenues from excise duties. There is a grea= t deal of leakage in this area. The absence of services in the tax net is a= lso a major problem. We should really move to a modern integrated VAT, whic= h is the least distortive form of indirect taxation. If we could move to a = VAT covering goods and services we could generate additional revenues of tw= o to three per cent of GDP. This has been the experience of many countries = which have adopted an integrated VAT. However, that requires a Constitution= al amendment. Pending that, we have to rationalise the excise duty structur= e and integrate services taxation with goods in an expanded Cenvat. The Par= thasarathy Shome Committee has made some new interesting  proposals in this=  regard.  I am emphasising the changes needed on the revenue side because there is re= ally no margin available to   reduce the total government expenditure to GD= P ratio. On the expenditure side, what we need is a   restructuring of expe= nditures, in which we reduce subsidies and wasteful current expenditures bu= t use the   resources released to increase public investment in education, = health care, roads (both highways and rural   roads) and other economic inf= rastructure where the private sector will not invest. In short, total gover= nment expenditure in India is not too high. The political support for cutti= ng expenditure and downsizing the   bureaucracy can only come if this is se= en as a redirection of expenditure to other more important uses. The improv= ement in the fiscal balance must therefore come from the revenue side. We a= re not mobilising as much as we should from existing rate structure and we = are not doing enough to raise user charges for services provided by the gov= ernment. Whether it is the railways or higher education, or power, or provi= sion of municipal services, we must increase user charges so that these sys= tems generate the revenues needed to ensure efficient supply.  If this does not happen, can the economy attain the eight per cent growth t= hat the Draft Tenth Five Year plan would like to see in the next five years= ?  If we don't tackle the fiscal problem facing the government, we will not be=  able to undertake essential public investment in social and economic infra= structure. Interest rates will remain high which means private investment w= ill also not take place and the growth we have targeted will definitely not=  be possible. The Planning Commission has said this loud and clear in the A= pproach document (10th Plan). The PM's Economic Advisory Council has said t= he same thing.  I must emphasise that the recipe for high growth is not just public investm= ent. Private investment is 70% of   total investment and high growth depend= s crucially on private investment and its efficiency. Reforms must   contin= ue if private enterprise is to do its bit. But, this growth process needs t= o be underpinned by public   investment in crucial sectors of social and ec= onomic infrastructure which depends on the fiscal health of the   governmen= t.  Do you see economic growth getting stuck at the 5.5% to 6.0% of the past tw= o decades and economic   policy getting stuck in political debates?=20  I certainly hope not, but that depends on whether our policies evolve in th= e right direction. I remain hopeful  mainly because we have been able to mo= ve forward in the past decade even if fitfully. Five years ago, we were deb= ating insurance sector liberalisation. Now that is done with and over, and = nobody worries about it. Even on privatisation, look at Balco. There were f= undamentalist positions being taken, but the issue has been resolved. From = the fact that something looks very difficult today, we should not conclude = that nothing will happen. However, we must recognise that we cannot continu= e with this slow pace of change. It is not enough to make progress compared=  to the past. In a competitive world we have to benchmark against our compe= titors and that is where progress is clearly not fast enough. I hope the Te= nth Plan can be used as an opportunity to re-review the momentum on a core = set of policy changes. If that is done, we should be able to reach 8.0% gro= wth. Otherwise it will be difficult.  Are you worried that this year again we might slip on growth?  The economy is decelerating at present and the first two months of this (fi= scal) year show no immediate sign of a turnaround. It is difficult to say w= hether the situation will turn around in the rest of this year. The global = slowdown will certainly hold back investment. However, short-term prospects=  are not the only issue. The issue for us is to outline what we need to do = to move on to a higher growth path of 8.0% or so over the next 5 years.  In your two decades in economic policy making what have been the most diffi= cult challenges you have had to face?  The most difficult challenge was clearly getting out of the crisis of 1991.=  It is difficult to imagine now how difficult the situation was then. The R= BI was forced to restrict access to foreign exchange for exporters in order=  to manage its low reserves position. By 1993, the entire crisis was behind=  us. The critics of liberalisation, and there were many, predicted at the t= ime that the policy of liberalising external controls would be an absolute = disaster. I take some satisfaction that these critics were proved comprehen= sively wrong. The policy initiatives were well grounded in both economic th= eory and practice,  especially the experience of other countries and they w= orked.  This suggests that if we are serious about change it is not necessary to wa= it to generate political consensus which would ensure support from all quar= ters. We have to look two years ahead and hope that people will come around=  to supporting the reforms if they work. The experience of the last ten yea= rs certainly tells us that while change is resisted when it is proposed- (a= nd this is possibly even a good thing since it generates debate and shapes = policy in a way that makes it acceptable to a wider constituency)-at the en= d of the day, people accept sensible policies. The Press plays a major role=  in persuading people. I must say that so far it has generally backed sensible policies.  The policies of the last decade have been criticised for getting the sequen= cing wrong. Indian industry has said that it was wrong to have done so much=  on external liberalisation without doing enough on internal liberalisation= . Is this fair criticism?=20  I don't think this is entirely fair. It is not true to say that domestic li= beralisation was not bold. We got rid of industrial licensing and MRTP at o= ne stroke. Indian industry was given the freedom to expand, upgrade   techn= ology and access capital markets, even markets abroad. By contrast, the ope= ning up on the external side was very slow. QRs were removed fully 10 years=  after the reforms began and even today our tariffs are still the highest i= n the world, three times higher than in south-east Asia. There is no eviden= ce that Indian industry has been swamped by external competition. Had this = been the case, you should have seen a huge increase in non-oil imports. On = the contrary, in the last three years, non-oil imports have been totally sl= uggish.  That is not to say that we have been able to do all we should to support do= mestic industry. I think we should have moved faster with infrastructure re= form especially power sector reform, to give Indian industry support on tha= t front. Similarly, we should have moved faster to remove reservations from=  the small-scale sector. If we have to compete with other developing countr= ies, including China, we must get out of the present policy of  reservation=  for the small-scale sector and allow the SSIs to expand to competitive sca= les. However, if it is difficult to make all these changes at once, it does= n't mean there should be no external liberalisation until everything on the=  domestic side is done.  Were the first steps we took on power sector reforms wrong? I mean, did we = make mistakes negotiating with Enron on the Dabhol Power project?=20  As you know, the Enron project is currently going through a process of re-n= egotiation and I would not like to comment on it. It is a state government = project which was negotiated by the state government, and then   re-negotia= ted again by the state government. =20  But it is said the Union finance ministry at that time, and you were there,=  had urged the speeding up of clearances and was keen on getting the projec= t off the ground.  This is factually incorrect. The Finance Ministry was never concerned with = speeding up or giving any project clearances for Enron. The only clearance = Finance Ministry was directly involved in was the foreign investment cleara= nce given by the FIPB where the Finance Ministry was represented. That clea= rance only involves permission for foreign investment. All the other cleara= nces are the responsibility of other agencies and the Finance Ministry was = not involved in that process.  But you gave the counter-guarantee?    Yes, the Finance Ministry gave the counter-guarantee. However, that was a=  cabinet decision to give  counter-guarantee to 8 projects. The Dabhol PPA = had already been tied up by then.  What lessons did you draw from the Enron experience?  I am not sufficiently familiar with the details of the Dabhol Project but I=  would focus on two major lessons. First,  it is clear that the power tarif= fs from the Dabhol Project have turned out to be much higher than the Gover= nment of Maharashtra had anticipated. This definitely suggests the need for=  greater due diligence on the part of State Governments before they lock th= emselves into long-term power purchase contracts. It is particularly import= ant to quantify likely risks arising out of possible variations in fuel pri= ces and exchange rate changes.  Second, when a State Electricity Board contracts for purchase of power, it = should have the capacity to absorb the power as well as pay for it. At the = time when the DPC project was signed the State Government may have assumed = that it would undertake the requisite reforms that were needed in the power=  sector to enable the SEB to pay for the additional power. Since the reform= s could not materialise the ability to pay is simply not there. The relevan= t lesson for the future is that much needed and well-known reforms designed=  to ensure current viability of the power system should not be delayed. Oth= erwise it will be difficult to pay for power from new projects whether in t= he private sector or the public sector.  So you agree that mistakes were made in power sector privatisation?  During the decade of 1990s, there has been a great deal of evolution in res= tructuring of the electricity industry across the world. Even in some of th= e developed countries, reliance was initially placed on long term purchase = contracts that subsequently had to be re-negotiated and opened up to market=  forces. Reforms in Orissa have been an important learning experience. I th= ink it is important that we absorb the lessons of experience in different s= tates and make sure that policies for the future avoid some of the problems=  that have arisen not only in India but in many other countries also.  Another issue that you grappled with in the finance ministry where it is be= lieved your perceptions were different from that of some others was the que= stion of India going nuclear and the likely impact of sanctions on the Indi= an economy. With hindsight would you say your concerns were exaggerated?=20  I don't think our assessment of the situation was wrong. Our assessment at = the time of the 1998 tests, was   that there would be a negative reaction o= n aid flows in the short run, but there will be no impact on the trade  fro= nt except in the form of restrictions on export to India of certain sensiti= ve items. Over the medium run, the economic impact of the tests on the econ= omy as a whole would depend primarily on the quality of economic management=  and the progress of economic reform. We were consistently of the view that=  the long-term economic performance of the economy ought to depend more on = trade and private capital flows rather than official aid flows. India's acc= ess to international capital flows depends entirely on how private capital = markets view us, and that is a function of our economic policies, and econo= mic performance. That is more or less what  happened.  Your policies have not really helped attract foreign investment into India = in a big way. Why?=20  We have seen an increase in foreign investment but not huge flows of FDI co= ming into India, like in China.  However that was never really expected. Pe= rsonally I think we should be satisfied if we can double or treble existing=  levels of FDI flows within the next five years. For this to happen, the ma= in steps needed are to improve the performance of infrastructure in certain=  critical areas. Central Government policy towards FDI is not the constrain= t. There are some sectoral caps in some sectors (mainly telecommunications,=  civil aviation, insurance and banking) but there are no restrictions elsew= here. If we can create an environment in which it is perceived that India's=  infrastructure constraints are being overcome and adequate investment is b= eing made in power, roads, railways, telecommunications, etc, then foreign = investors will look at India much more positively as an investment destinat= ion.=20  As someone who is now going to Washington DC to evaluate the International = Monetary Fund, how do you view the severe criticism the Fund has attracted = after its handling of the Asian financial crisis, the Russian economy and e= conomic crises elsewhere, including in India.  The Fund's programmes in East Asia have been widely criticised and the Fund=  management has also   recognised that some mistakes were made in East Asia= . However, it should be recognised that the East   Asian crisis, like the M= exican crisis before it, was very different from traditional external payme= nts crises the Fund was used to handling. These crises reflect the extreme = vulnerability of developing countries to a sudden loss of confidence in a w= orld where capital has become highly mobile, at least for countries which a= dopt capital account convertibility. The name of the game in such cases is = not so much to provide some funds IMF but more generally to take action tha= t will restore confidence of private markets in the quickest possible way. = It is clear that the IMF programmes did not succeed in restoring confidence=  very quickly. How far the problem was due to the Funds policies and how mu= ch it reflected the basic uncontrollability of such crises in the short run= , is difficult to say. In retrospect it is important to mention that perfor= mance in different countries has been difficult. In Korea, for instance, th= e recovery has been was remarkable, much better than projected by the origi= nal critics. Indonesia on the other hand remains mired in difficulties. In = Brazil, the situation appears to have been well handled.  The Fund is now fully aware of the fact that its conditionality must be tai= lored to the specific circumstances of each case. You mentioned our experie= nce with the Fund and I should point out that it has been very positive. We=  entered into a programme with the Fund which was fully our own, and reflec= ted a genuine internal consensus on the need to give a new direction to our=  policies. The crisis was overcome more quickly than was predicted. We drew=  less from the Fund than was initially expected and our post-programme grow= th rate was very high. So, we should have no complaint. The Fund would have=  no problems if all its programmes were like the India programme!  You have now spent two decades in government offering policy advice. Has th= e quality of economic policy making improved in India in this period or wor= sened?  The quality of debate on economic policy has hugely improved. The economic = press, the interaction between government and industry, the public debate h= ave all improved.  Your assignment with the Fund is for four years.

Fidelity restated its holdings in an amended 13F filing on May 16, 2001.  -----------------------------------------------------------  13F: IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERECES: BOWMAN AND PEQUOT FACE BREAKUPS  Following the collapse of Long Term Capital Management, a number of the remaining billion-dollar hedge funds have continued to be troubled by poor investment returns and management shake-ups.  With Julian Robertson and George Soros out of the picture, some of the smaller funds have continued to drop out of the running or morph their institutions.  The recent months and days of 2001 have seen the breakup of Pequot Capital Management's ARTHUR SAMBERG and DANIEL BENTON and the reported breakup of Bowman Capital's LARRY BOWMAN and JOHN HURLEY.  For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Bowman Capital reported ownership of 116 companies, valued at $3.0 billion, a sharp decline from the previous quarter, when the firm reported ownership of 132 companies, valued at $4.2 billion.  One year ago, for the first quarter of 2000, Bowman reported ownership of 224 companies valued at $12.0 billion.  Bowman first made a name for itself riding the cusp of the technology boom. The firm aggressively invested in technology while hedging its bets.  One year ago, the firm's average portfolio P/E was neatly double the average P/E of the S&P 500.  It has since fallen dramatically, to only slightly above the S&P.  In an article in Barron's on Saturday May 12, 2001, it was reported that Bowman's two principals, Larry Bowman and John Hurley, would be going their separate ways.  The firm has not responded.  The breakup, it is widely believed, is a result of lagging performance in a difficult market.  While the firm shorts and hedges against potential downturns, the firm's technology focus may have left it few places to hide.  Bowman has also made notable efforts in recent years to expand its involvement in private equity and mezzanine financing.  It even opened a new office in London to focus on European venture capital.  During the dot.com boom, venture capital was an excellent way to get involved in high-tech companies on the ground floor.  As the IPO market has shriveled up and technology stocks have fallen out of favor, Bowman has been left holding long positions in companies that benefited from an opening IPO pop, but that suffered following the downturn.  One such example was fiber-optic communications equipment maker Oni Systems Corp. [ONIS].  Bowman was on the ground floor of the company, supplying it with private financing. Shortly after the firm's 2000 IPO, the stock reached an all time high of 142.0.  On May 17, 2001, the company closed at 33.15.  Bowman's top five new purchases for the quarter included: Lexmark International Inc. [LXK] with 1,000,000 shares (valued at $45.5. million); Compaq Computer Corp. [CPQ] with 2,220,000 shares (valued at $40.4 million); Mercury Interactive Corp. [MERQ] with 800,000 shares (valued at $33.5 million); Rambus Inc. Del [RMBS] with 1,600,000 shares (valued at $33.0 million); and, Apple Computer with 1,379,600 shares (valued at $30.4 million).  Bowman's top five holdings for the first quarter included: Microsoft Corp. [MSFT] with 6,258,100 shares (valued at $342.2 million); EMC Corp MA [EMC] with 5,372,000 shares (valued at $157.9 million); Qualcomm Inc. [QCOM] with 2,746,240 shares (valued at $155.5 million); Oracle Corp. [ORCL] with 8,568,500 shares (valued at $128.4 million); and, Sonus Networks Inc. [SONS] with 6,400,000 shares (valued at $127.7 million).  Arthur Samberg and Daniel Benton, the managers and founding partners of hedge fund giant Pequot Capital Management, are also ending their partnership, it was reported last month.  Benton is reportedly leaving to run his own hedge fund, Andor Capital Management. Samberg will remain at Pequot and continue to manage the Westport, CT-based firm.  The split, it has been reported, was not a result of poor performance, or souring market conditions; such conditions were responsible for the downfall of Soros Fund Management and Julian Robertson's Tiger Management. The split is reportedly a result of differing opinions and visions of Pequot's future. Benton, a technology specialist, wanted to continue to make large bets, long or short, on technology, while Samberg was interested in further diversification. The fund has also struggled under a growing asset base. In a letter to shareholders following the fourth quarter, the firm reported in excess of $15 billion in net assets under management. However, in its 13F, filed for the quarter ended December 31, 2000, the firm reported ownership of 493 companies, valued at $7.6 billion, a sharp decrease from the first quarter of 2000, when the firm reported ownership of 517 companies valued at $16.5 billion.  For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, the firm's reported equity asset declined again, to a reported ownership of 563 companies, valued at $6.4 billion.  Pequot's top five new purchases included: Qwest Communications International Inc. [Q] with 5,608,900 shares (valued at $196.6 million); Electronic Arts [ERTS] with 3,617,100 shares (valued at $196.2 million); Philip Morris Cos Inc. [MO] with 2,300,000 shares (valued at $109.1 million); NTT DoCoMo Inc. with 6,065 shares (valued at $105.5 million); and, Invitrogen Corp. [IVGN] with 1,779,000 shares (valued at $97.6 million).  Pequot's top five holdings included: Qwest Communications International Inc. [Q] with 5,608,900 shares (valued at $196.6 million); Electronic Arts [ERTS] with 3,617,100 shares (valued at $196.2 million); Pfizer Inc. [PFE] with 4,722,853 shares (valued at $193.4 million); Curagen Inc. [CRGN] with 6,450,500 shares (valued at $151.2 million); and, Incyte Genomics Inc. [INCY] with 9,343,700 shares (valued at $143.4 million).   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------  13F: ORIGIN CAPITAL MAINTAINS DEVOTION TO HEALTH CARE  Founded in 2000, San Francisco-based hedge fund Origin Capital Management hit the ground running in its first year in operation.  Launched at a time when the markets were on very shaky ground, the firm reported $620.9 million in equity assets for its first 13F filing for the quarter ended December 31, 2000.  Walter ""Buzz"" Burlock, a former Soros Fund Management managing director, spearheaded this new venture to invest in both public and pre-IPO companies predominately in the health care sector.  For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, the firm reported $428.3 million in equity assets invested in a portfolio of 96 companies, a decrease of approximately $200.0 million dollars from the prior quarter.  Not surprisingly, health care and biotechnology were the most heavily weighted sectors in Origin's portfolio.  Approximately, 52.4% of the portfolio was invested in biotech companies, followed by health care, which comprised 23.7% of the portfolio.  Consumer staples was the next most heavily weighted sector, with 10.2% of the portfolio, giving it a slight edge over drugs/pharmaceuticals, which comprised 7.3% of the portfolio.  Although the majority of the portfolio (50.2%) fell in the large-cap arena, there was a fairly large representation of mid- and small-cap companies, with 21.2% and 28.6%, respectively.  New positions for the quarter included a 200,000 share position in Elan Plc-ADR [ELN]; a 200,000 share position in Alza Corp. [AZA] valued at $8.1 million; 150,000 shares of AstraZeneca Plc-ADR [AZN] valued at $7.2 million; 100,000 shares of Bristol Myers Squibb Co.  [BMY] valued at $5.9 million; and, 80,800 shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.- ADR [TEVA] with 80,800 shares valued at $4.4 million.  Top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001, included: McKesson HBOC Inc. [MCK] with 1,218,600 shares valued at $32.6 million; Boston Scientific Corp. [BSX] with 1,607,000 shares valued at $32.4 million; Biogen Inc. [BGEN] with 510,000 shares valued at $32.3 million; Genentech Inc. [DNA] with 536,200 with $27.1 million; and, Quintiles Transnational Corp. [QTRN] with 807,450 shares valued at $15.2 million.  -----------------------------------------------------------  13F: GALLEON FAVORS BIOTECH, COMPUTERS  For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Galleon Management L.P. reported ownership of 131 companies valued at $1.2 billion, a decline from the previous quarter when the firm reported ownership of 105 companies valued at $1.7 billion.  It most recent filing is a notable decline from less than a year ago, when the firm reported ownership of 147 companies valued at over $2.7 billion.  The high profile fund run by hedge fund guru Raj Rajaratnam is just one of several hedge funds that have seen their assets under management decrease amid a slumping technology market.  Recent weeks and months have seen high profile splits in hedge funds such as Pequot Management Inc. and Bowman Capital Management, L.L.C.  Top five micro sector weightings for the firm included biotechnology with 12.8%, computer hardware (10.9%), computer software (10.9%), health care (drugs/pharmaceuticals) (10.1%), and computers (networking) (9.0%).  Some of the firm's expanded interest in the biotech and health care sectors may be a result of the recent addition of SAMUEL NAVARRO.  Navarro, formerly a managing director and sell-side global head of Health Care Corporate Finance at ING Barings, recently joined the firm as an analyst and managing director of the Galleon Group Health Care Fund.  Navarro's addition follows the departure of PREM LACHMAN, formerly a partner and portfolio manager providing coverage of the pharmaceuticals, contract services and distribution sector.  Lachman launched his own venture, Maximus Capital, with the help of former Moore Capital Management professional Joanne Soja and former Morgan Stanley Dean Witter portfolio manager Teresa McRoberts.  Many of Galleon's other offerings tend to weigh more heavily in tech, including the Galleon Omni Fund (formerly known as Needham Omni Fund), the Calypso Advisors LLC and Needham Emerging Growth Partners, LP.  Top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 included: Corvis Corp. [CORV] with 11,050,000 shares (valued at $77.7 million); Nasdaq 100 Trust [QQQ] with 1,850,000 shares (valued at $72.4 million); Microsoft Corp. [MSFT] with 1,050,000 shares (valued at $57.4 million); Compaq Computer Corp. [CPQ] with 2,000,500 shares (valued at $36.4 million); and, Gateway Inc. [GTW] with 2,094,800 shares (valued at $35.2 million).  Top five new purchases included the firm's largest holdings: switching and routing equipment maker Corvis Corp. as well as Compaq and Gateway. Rounding out the top five are Texas Instruments Inc. [TXN] with 1,000,000 shares (valued at $31.0 million) and Exodus Communications Inc. [EXDS] with 2,050,000 shares (valued at $22.0 million).  ---------------------------------------------------------  SECTOR COVERAGE: ALLIANCE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT L.P.  *PAUL RISSMAN: Director of Global Equity Research *MIKE BALDWIN: Associate Director of Research  *CHRIS ARISTIDES: Internet software & security and enterprise hardware & storage *ROBERT ASHTON: telecommunications services *JACQUES BOUTHILLIER: machinery, building products, hardware & tools, pollution control, paper, paper products and containers *VINCENT DUPONT: optical components *NORMAN FIDEL: pharmaceuticals and healthcare services *ANDREW FRANK: enterprise software & communications semiconductors *MARISA GILLIAM: printing, publishing & advertising *LISA HINTZ: insurance, brokerage & money management *KATHLEEN KOLTES: quantitative analysis *LARRY KREICHER: economist *VIVIAN LEE: airlines, leisure, restaurants, lodging, education services and toys *SUSANNE LENT: multi-industry, rails, electrical group, and aerospace/defense *KRISTIN MANTON: retail, apparel, department stores, and apparel/footwear *SCOTT MCELROY: beverages, food, retail food & drug, household products & personal care *KOMAL MISRA: IT services, mainframes, mainframe software, and contract manufacturing *MATTHEW MURRAY: biotechnology, medical products, and healthcare information technology *RICHARD NEWITTER: quantitative analysis *TANYA ODOM: food and tobacco *NITA PATEL: business processors and wireless data *AMY RASKIN: networking & telecom equipment *TOM SCHMITT: oil & oil service and commodity/specialty chemicals *JANE SCHNEIROV: multi-industry, automotive and connectors *GERRI SOMMERS: retail, hardlines & discounters, and Internet retailers *FRANK SUOZZO: banks, credit, government sponsored enterprises & thrifts *THANH TRAN: media & entertainment and broadcasting/cable *ANNIE TSAO: electric utilities, natural gas pipelines, and independent power producers *JANET WALSH: semiconductors and semiconductor equipment *STEVEN WELLER: telecommunications services and satellites  ----------------------------------------------------------  NOTE: Positions reported are derived from 13F filings, which do not include cash figures, and may not be representative of a firm's equity assets as of March 31, 2001.

2022-04-20 03:09:25+00:00,true,6,"  With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.  In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.    Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

2022-04-20 07:00:09+00:00,true,6,"  Below are the key points of a conference call held on Friday, May 11, 2001. Attending were Gene Massey of Arent Fox and Coralina Rivera, Dan Masters, and Paul Y'Barbo of Enron. The call was in reference to the LNG supply contract between EcoElectrica and Cabot LNG. Enron LNG got the answers it hoped to get and more.  1. Article 12.3 gives Cabot the right to not deliver a Winter Cargo to Eco if Cabot is unable to complete an Algerian Loading within a window specified in the contract. Cabot could give notice to Eco as late as 3 days prior to the scheduled loading of the Winter Cargo that Cabot will be unable to deliver the cargo. The failure to complete the Algerian Loading must not be the result of a default by Cabot or Distrigas. The failure to achieve an Algerian Loading may not necessarily be the result of an Algerian Force Majeure situation.   2. Article 12.3 (b) (iv) gives Eco the right to secure replacement fuel for the Winter Cargo. If Eco notices Cabot that Eco has the opportunity to secure replacement fuel, then Cabot has 10 days to notify Eco whether or not they are willing to release the right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. Eco may buy replacement fuel regardless of whether or not Cabot releases the right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. In other words, even if Cabot commits to delivery of a Winter Cargo, Eco is under no obligation to purchase a Winter Cargo from Cabot.   If Cabot is unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo, then Eco will buy the replacement fuel and will not have to pay the Demand Charge or Demand Surcharge on the Winter Cargo, a quantity equal to 119,000 cubic meters (~$4.7 MM).  If Cabot releases its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo and Eco still buys the replacement fuel, then Eco will receive no reduction in the annual Demand Charges and Demand Surcharge.  Eco has until December 1st to give notice that it has the opportunity to buy replacement fuel. It was Gene's opinion that the sooner Eco gives notice (today would be good), the less likely Cabot would be willing to give up its right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. Thus, the more likely Eco would be able to get a reduction in Demand Charges and elimination of the Demand Surcharge.  Important Note: The economics of the deal work such that the largest monetary benefit of buying replacement fuel exists when December/January/February U.S. natural gas prices are at their lowest point of the year.  If U.S. natural gas prices were to go down a little further, Eco would want to buy more non-Cabot LNG than just the Winter Cargo replacement.  3. Per Article 7.5, Eco's annual purchase commitment is 66% of the LNG consumed at the Power Facility up to a maximum of 19.46 TBtu (~7 Standard Cargoes). In a year in which the Power Facility consumes 9 Standard Cargoes, Eco would need to ""purchase"" 6 Standard Cargoes from Cabot. Failure to do so would result in payment of liquidated damages of approximately $0.36/MMBtu.  Important Note: Per Article 7.5, if replacement fuel is purchased rather than buying a Winter Cargo from Cabot, that quantity counts as though it were purchased from Cabot for the purpose of assessing whether or not Eco met its annual purchase commitment. Thus, in a year in which the Power Facility consumes 9 Standard Cargoes, Eco could buy replacement fuel instead of a Cabot Winter Cargo plus 5 Standard Cargoes from Cabot and still meet its annual commitment.  There are benefits to Eco for buying replacement fuel - certainty of supply and a lower price. Enron LNG should continue to pursue a deal with Eco. I plan to schedule a meeting with Mariella Mahan as soon as she is available.  I will provide an update of the economics of this trade in my next e-mail.

2022-04-20 02:16:22+00:00,true,6,"  Notice # 01-156 May 9, 2001  TO: All NYMEX Members and Member Firms  FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President  RE: NYMEX Post-Close Trading Session Rules  DATE: May 8, 2001 ===========================================================  This Notice advises Members and Member Firms of changes to the two post-close session rules applicable to the NYMEX Division.  !    As a result of amendments to both rules, the post-close sessions generally offered Monday-Thursday will be the same as the Friday sessions with two exceptions.  !    Monday-Thursday. These sessions will start at 3:25 p.m. and will be two minutes long.  !    Fridays. These sessions will start at 3:30 p.m. and will be five minutes long.   End of Week Post-Close Trading Session (Rule 6.57A)  As a reminder and as a follow-up to a Notice distributed last week, please be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.57A, the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule, will become effective. The new version of this rule is attached below.  For Friday post-close sessions (and for post-close sessions the day before a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in effect:  (1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the first 12 consecutive listed contract months.  (2)  The sessions now will be 5 minutes in duration.  (3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the following ticks above (below) the daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price fluctuation limits then in effect):  Crude Oil      20 ticks Heating Oil         50 ticks Unleaded Gas        50 ticks Natural Gas         50 ticks   Monday-Thursday Post-Close Trading Sessions (Rule 6.57)  In addition, please be advised that beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, a number of amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.57, the Exchange's post-close trading session rule for days other than Fridays, will become effective.  The new version of this rule is attached below.  (1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the first 12 consecutive listed contract months.  (2)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the following ticks above (below) the daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price fluctuation limits then in effect):  Crude Oil      20 ticks Heating Oil         50 ticks Unleaded Gas        50 ticks Natural Gas         50 ticks  (3)  Customer participation will be expanded to the same extent as is permitted for the End of Week Post Close Session. Please note that any order submitted during the RTH session, including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders, limit orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have expired as of the end of RTH for purposes of this Session.  Accordingly, in the event that a market participant with such an expired order seeks to participate in the Session, a new order must be submitted.  (4)  As a consequence of the expanded trading range and customer participation, trades done during this period will be price reported on PRS.  Finally, please be advised that, as a matter of practice, the Exchange does not currently offer post-close trading sessions for Propane futures contracts.  If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207.

Accordingly, in the event that a market participant with such an expired order seeks to participate in the End of Week Session, a new order must be submitted.

2022-04-20 14:15:52+00:00,true,6,"  Kjell- Thank you for the prompt response on my request for a report on this incident.  Please be advised that this delay could pose a problem at the discharge port as there may be another ship waiting to get in on that date.  The ship scheduled before us (the ""Bachir Chihani"") has slipped to an ETA of June 9 as well, so if that ship arrives before the ""Hoegh Galleon"", we may face delays in getting to the berth.  This could impact our ability to heel out the cargo, which means the economic impact to this delay could be more than just the lost day on the ship.  My current calculation for incentive to heel out the cargo is nearly $140,000.  I have asked CMS about the possibility of bringing the ship in on June 8 after the normal time usually allowed to start inbound (approximately 14:00 to 15:00lt).  I will let you know as soon as I receive a response.  In the meantime, please provide an ETA to Lake Charles using what you consider to be the maximum speed possible for the remainder of the trip.  It is very disappointing that so much effort would be put into flying a pump from the US to Europe and then so little effort put into trucking the same pump to it's final destination within Europe.  It seems that the least costly part of the trip has ended up costing a day of utilization on the vessel and could have an additional $140,000 impact.

2022-04-20 02:55:29+00:00,true,6,"  Notice # 01-162 May 11, 2001  TO: All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms  FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President  RE: Reminder and Clarification on NYMEX Division Post-Close Trading Sessions  DATE:          May 11, 2001 =========================================================== Reminder Changes will be going into effect today, Friday, May 11, 2001 for the End of Week post-close trading sessions and also, beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, for the Monday-Thursday post-close trading sessions. The trading range for all of these sessions will be expanded by adding the following ticks above (below) the daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price fluctuation limits then in effect): Crude Oil      20 ticks Heating Oil         50 ticks Unleaded Gas        50 ticks Natural Gas         50 ticks  Clarification Previously, the trading range for the Monday-Thursday sessions was the closing range for the applicable contract month. Exchange staff interpreted the rule to provide that if a contract month did not trade during the close, there would be no closing range and thus it would not be permissible to trade that contract month during the post-close.  Now, as noted above, the post-close session trading range on any day of the week will be an expanded version of the daily range. Therefore, the Exchange is issuing the following clarifications as to the contract months that can be traded during a post-close session (on any day of the week):  1.   Only the first twelve listed contract months are eligible for trading in the post-close.  2.   If a particular contract month does not trade during the RTH session, it may not be traded during the post-close.  3.   It is not necessary for a contract month to trade during the close in order to be traded in the post-close as long as it has traded during the RTH session.  If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207.

2022-04-20 06:07:52+00:00,true,6,"  I met with Johnny R. Fern?ndez, Esq., Executive Director of Codezol, C.D. (Corporaci?n para el Desarrollo de la Zona Libre de Ponce, C.D.).  Codezol, C.D. is the Foreign Trade Zone #163 at Ponce, PR.  I requested information regarding the license to operate a sub zone under the Foreign Trade Zone #163.  Codezol presents the application form to the Free Trade Zone Board in Washington.  The paperwork needed is very extensive, requires specific information and is prepared by a law firm that is specialized in these matters.  He recommends two law firms: Miller & Company, Marshall V. Miller in Washington, DC which as per Codezol is the more experienced in these matters and Phelan & Mitri from Connecticut which where the ones that helped Peerless Oil & Gas get their sub zone.  A good start would be a letter from us which should include our location, legal description of the property, the exact a creage, number of tanks and their capacities, if we are a local company or subsidiary of a US firm.  When I mentioned to Mr. Fern?ndez if we can have a sub zone for ProCaribe and EcoEl?ctrica he doesn't see much problem but he needs to know more details of ProCaribe and EcoEl?ctrica to see if we can ask for one or two sub zones.  BENEFITS OF A SUB ZONE  v No import tax ""Crudita"" paid until the sale is done.  You don't pay ""Crudita"" while the propane is in our tanks or when there is a re export.  It helps with the cash flow.  v You don't pay personal property tax.  ProCaribe pays around $150,000 per year.  v You don't pay ""Patentes"" (%of yearly revenue tax) for any volume of re export.  Only for local sales.  Patentes are paid to the Pe?uelas Municipality.  Fees of around $25,000 per year have to be paid to Codezol.  Weekly reports of inventories have to be sent to Codezol.  Facilities inspections will be held by Codezol, Crim, and US Customs prior to receiving the license.  The process can take from 9 months to 12 months.  It is faster in products like propane and natural gas, is slower in products like diesel or gasoline.  I spoke with Suzanne Clapp and she told me she doesn't have experience in free trade zones.  She mentioned the name of Armando Lima that can put us in contact with the Free Trade Zone personnel in Puerto Rico.     It took Peerless 14 months to get the sub zone because there was some ""prejudice with oil during the Clinton Administration"".  It costs them $60,000 in legal fees and it was done by Phelan & Mitri.  Marshall Miller did the Codezol license and it cost $40,000 in legal fees but it was much less work than the one done by Peerless.  As per Mr. Fern?ndez, the next step is a short history of us so he can understand who we are and what we do.  Any questions please let me know so I can pass it on to Codezol.

and settle differences over continued sup= port to a controversial $2.9 billion power project in India. Representative= s of some of the world's largest banks like Citibank, ABN AMRO, and Bank of=  America, will be at the meeting. Indian lenders like the Industrial Develo= pment Bank of India, State Bank of India and ICICI will also participate. M= arket analysts speculate that the meeting will attempt to forge a joint sta= nd on supporting the project which now produces 740 MW of power and is slat= ed to increase it to 2,184 MW shortly in its second phase. But it comes aga= inst a backdrop of rising tension between Dabhol and the Indian state utili= ty, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), which is the sole buyer=  of Dabhol's electricity.=20 Indian lenders, who have lent the bulk of the funds to the plant, want to c= ontinue supporting the project. But they are being opposed by offshore lend= ers who want to withdraw their loans. Loans of around $638 million of the o= ffshore lenders are covered by guarantees provided by Indian institutions. = The Indian lenders, fearing for their profitability if the foreign banks pu= ll the plug, plan to oppose any such move. But they have been forced on the=  backfoot by MSEB's decision last week to stop buying power from Dabhol and=  terminate its 1995 contract with the company under which it agreed to lift=  the entire output.=20 The MSEB has complained that Dabhol produces costly power while Dabhol has = blamed MSEB for defaulting on payments worth $48 million. Last month, Dabho= l issued a preliminary notice to terminate its contract to sell power. It h= as also filed for arbitration in London. This provoked MSEB to haul Dabhol = before a local regulatory body, the Maharashtra State Electricity Regulator= y Commission (MERC), which issued a temporary order staying the arbitration=  proceedings. The dispute has already affected India's image among foreign = investors.=20 Last week, global rating agency Moody's expressed concern over slippage in = the Indian government's reform programme and cited the Enron's dispute as a= n example that the country may be losing credibility with foreign investors= . ""The dispute indicates that India's government may not be willing to live=  up to its contractual obligations. As a consequence, this would further de= ter foreign direct investment from coming into the country,"" Moody's said. = Union Power Minister Suresh Prabhu tried to dispel those fears in an interv= iew with Reuters on Sunday.

The FIs team is led by Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) exec= utive director R S Agarwal, who is also DPC board member.

FIs had last evening, held a meeting with=  MSEB, trying to comprehend the state electricity board's views and stand o= n resolving the crisis before embarking on the visit to Singapore. ``MSEB h= as firmly told us that it will be able to draw power from DPC's first phase=  only at a renegotiated lesser price and it wanted the Centre to take over = phase II'', FI sources said. The foreign lenders have already taken a tough=  stance on the issue and had also approved the preliminary termination noti= ce in the April 23 meeting held in London, the sources added.=20 Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is understood to have asked Union power=  minister Suresh Prabhu in a meeting between them on June 1 in Delhi to pur= sue the sale of power to deficit states as part of efforts to help DPC. Gov= ernment sources had said sale of power to other states had emerged as the o= nly option for Centre to help the troubled project as purchase of power by = central utilities was not possible.

Enron is building the plant, but the dispute with the MSEB, has threaten= ed to derail the 2,184-mw power project. ""We have to address those concerns=  adequately because the Government of India is always in favour of making s= ure that international contracts are respected in the process of assuring a= ll the foreign investors that there is no need for concern,"" Prabhu said.= =20  Signs emerged last week that investors were souring on India.=20  Global rating agency Fitch last Thursday revised India's sovereign rating o= utlook to negative from stable, citing concerns over fiscal policy, privati= sation and deterioration in the country's foreign investment climate.

""There is a negotiation going on. = The central government has a representative on the negotiating committee an= d I am sure that the only way in which commercial disputes can be settled i= s through negotiations.""

""The phase in which we are right now ... is the phase in which s= ome independent power producers have already contracted certain obligations=  which we will definitely like to uphold, which should be honoured,"" Prabhu=  added.

(Reuters) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE TIMES OF INDIA, Tuesday, June 05, 2001=20 Prabhu says power reforms enter new phase=20  India's reforms of its sputtering power sector have entered a new phase, wi= th plans afoot to free up private supply, overhaul debt-ridden state utilit= ies and recraft tariffs, Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told Reuters. With in= vestors' fears fanned by a squabble between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp an= d a local utility, Prabhu said in an interview late on Sunday that India is=  standing behind international contracts. ""Sanctity of contracts has to be = kept,"" Prabhu said.=20 The row began late last year when the utility in Maharashtra defaulted on p= ayments of $48 million to Dabhol Power Company, 65 percent owned by Enron. = The 2,184 MW power project is India's largest foreign investment, at $2.9 b= illion. Prabhu has vowed to take Indian reforms in a new direction. ""Absolu= tely,"" he said in reply to a question whether India's reforms have entered = a different phase. The Power Ministry will now also focus on power distribu= tion, he added, besides its early preoccupation with generation needs. ""In = India unfortunately for the last 10 years...reforms policy was skewed in fa= vour of generation,"" he said. ""We never really realised that distribution i= s the more important part of the process."" Prabhu added, ""We have now decid= ed we will make enough structural changes in distribution so that at the en= d of distribution enough investment is made.""=20 A chartered accountant, Prabhu hails from the verdant regions of India's we= stern coastal strand, and chaired a co-operative bank that was one of the c= ountry's largest, in terms of deposits, before his foray into politics. An = errant lock of hair straying across his forehead, Prabhu eschews the Indian=  politician's traditional uniform of starched white handspun cotton for the=  shirtsleeves and trousers preferred by the professionals who have entered = government, and whom local media call ""technocrats"". Prabhu said India has = decided to allow private producers to sell power direct to consumers, lifti= ng curbs that have hobbled the country's decade-old reform effort.=20 He said the question of power affordability had spurred him to ask India's = states to permit third-party sales of power, which analysts have called a s= tumbling-block for foreign investment. ""They cannot force a generator to se= ll power only to the SEBs, and that's a major change we are trying to make,= "" Prabhu said, referring to the states. SEBs or state electricity boards ar= e owned by the state governments, and supply power to most of India. India = estimates that 100,000 MW of fresh capacity will have to be installed over = the next 12 years to meet its power needs. Most of the $200 billion in fund= s that will be required will have to come from foreign private investment. = But India's spotty reform record over the last decade has made investors wa= ry. Bureaucratic procedures, legal delays and political wrangling have held=  up reform moves.=20 Last week global rating agency Fitch revised India's sovereign rating outlo= ok to negative from stable, citing fiscal concerns, the slow pace of privat= isation and deterioration in the country's foreign investment climate. Comp= eting agency Moody's sees signs of slippage in the reforms, and Standard & = Poor's has expressed worries over India's budget deficit. Prabhu said he wa= nts to overhaul state power utilities by introducing standard accounting po= licies, cutting transmission and distribution losses to 15 percent, and tac= kling crushing debt, thus helping to lure foreign investment into the secto= r. The poor financial health of the utilities, expected to run up combined = losses of about $6 billion in the 2001/02 fiscal year, has proved a hurdle = in efforts to draw private investment.=20 Prabhu said an expert panel examining ways to restructure SEB finances -- l= ooking at technical, commercial and tariff issues -- is expected to report = within a few weeks. ""For the first time we will be preparing commercial dat= a which is internationally accepted. We will be preparing technical data wh= ich is internationally appreciable. And thirdly, we'll be creating an infor= mation base which will be created by experts and then made available to the=  states,"" he said. The utilities' transmission and distribution losses run = to up to 25 percent of the electricity they generate, compared to a figure = of about eight percent internationally, he said.=20 Prabhu wants to trim this to about 15 percent within two or three years. ""I= n the case of India, I am willing to accept a figure of 14 percent to 15 pe= rcent, because to bring it below that will be technically feasible but Othe= r steps to tone up power generation include attempts to link the eastern re= gion with the rest of India, efforts to boost plant load factors through mo= dernisation of equipment, and to persuade people to use energy more efficie= ntly. Prabhu said he is building political will to support these moves thro= ugh a programme to tell consumers why they can no longer get power cheap, o= r even free, as many did in the past. (Reuters)=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Tuesday, June 05, 2001=20 Scrap the PPA with Dabhol?, Dr R K Pachauri=20  IT is unfortunate that the Dabhol project is in such a terrible mess. This = is clearly the result of serious lapses and mistakes on the part of all the=  stakeholders. But I would not agree with those who are clamouring for the = termination of the PPA by the Maharashtra government. It could very well ha= ppen that we are left with no choice in the end but to cancel the contract,=  but this if at all should be a legal decision and not a business decision.=  The fact of the matter is that we have a large facility established on Ind= ian soil, which we must find ways to use for the benefit of the country.=20  I have not seen the plant at all, but from all accounts that I have heard e= ven from those who regard the whole project as a big mistake, this is a ver= y well engineered plant. To harp on the termination of the contract would b= e like cutting your nose to spite your face. At no time must the action of = the MSEB, the Maharashtra government or the government of India be-or even = appear to be- arbitrary or spiteful.=20  The Dabhol officials have signaled their willingness to renegotiate the con= tract, and we must therefore go through the process with an open mind but w= ith our position clearly specified, namely that of getting a fair deal for = the consumer of Dabhol power. I believe the contract can be renegotiated an= d a reasonable tariff hammered out between the parties to the contract, and=  I also believe that the re-negotiations should be conducted directly betwe= en the parties themselves, unencumbered by any group or committee that may = have analysed the project. The road map for renegotiating the deal has been=  provided by the Committee set up to review the project in the report it ha= s submitted to the Maharashtra government. The rest is a matter of give and=  take based on how much each stakeholder is willing to concede.=20  The various measures outlined in the report clearly indicate the impact tha= t these would have on the tariff. If all these are followed and the sales t= o other customers facilitated such that the plant runs at full capacity, th= e tariff would come down substantially. Maharashtra cannot at this stage ab= sorb the power produced from the two phases of the project, and therefore o= ther parts of the country would need to be supplied the bulk of the output = from this plant. The central and the state governments must facilitate this=  as part of renegotiated deal, which of course would involve a major shift = in the position of the promoters of the project in several ways detailed in=  the report.=20  For all practical purposes, sales of power by IPPs are unrestricted, and ca= n involve more than one state. In the case of Dabhol, however, it was belie= ved at the stage of project design that all the power would be absorbed by = one state. There are today the so called mega power projects where power fr= om a particular project will be sold to more than one state. But I believe = there is a case for greater flexibility in the policy in this regard and ge= tting the Power Trading Corporation divested of its monopoly power as the o= nly trader for interstate supplies of power from IPPs.=20  One important feature of the Dabhol project is the large LNG facility and r= elated infrastructure that has been established. The answer to the question=  whether this should be treated as part of the power project depends on the=  fact whether these facilities are fully dedicated to the production of pow= er or have a large surplus capacity. In the case of Dabhol the latter happe= ns to be the case. Hence it makes both business sense and sound legal logic=  to separate the two.=20  There is no reason why the entire LNG infrastructure, which has capacity fa= r beyond the needs of the power project, should not be separated as a disti= nctly different profit centre. This would bring down the cost of power gene= rated significantly, and make the whole deal neat and transparent.

MSEB is liable for $1.4 billion plus (Rs=  6,500 crore plus) a year, year on year for the next twenty years. These pa= yments are indexed to just about all possible economic indices. The rise in=  payments in rupee terms is minimally 12 per cent a year.=20  b) It is not, repeat not, a foreign investment: one would have hoped that b= y now, if this nation has even a vestige of economic sense, the basic calcu= lation of the net foreign investment would be public.=20  The substantial over capitalisation (over 60-70 per cent), the direct lendi= ng by Indian FI's (about 55 per cent of the over-capitalised capital costs)= , the indirect lending (guarantees to by Indian FI's to foreign FI's- about=  18 per cent of project costs) and MSEB's own equity investments implies th= at all the money is Indian. The net effective investment on Enron's part is=  close to zero or even negative.=20  c) There is no set of economic circumstances (growth rates, industry off-ta= ke) or even political (MSEB ""reforms"") that will allow the purchase of this=  power. The basic premise that there are buyers for outrageously expensive = base-load power is itself fundamentally flawed.=20  Even in the most power deficient state, there is no shortage of power in th= e night. However the Enron meter keeps on ticking: in fact at the rate of U= S $ 0.184 million an hour, hour upon hour for 21.6 hours a day. There is no=  scope for payments of this magnitude even in ideal circumstances.=20  d) There is little scope for 're-negotiations' in an economically acceptabl= e manner. All the current talk (reduction of FI's interest rates, 'sharing = of burden' etc.) is largely of no consequence.=20  The fundamental issue remains the same - over-capitalisation, forex linkage= s (on the fuel LNG, etc.) and the profit margins (well in excess of those a= llowed by law - of the order of 60 per cent even on notional equity). Enron=  has stated in unequivocal terms that these are issues that are not open to=  negotiations of any kind.=20  e) It does not matter if Enron leaves. Given, the above, big deal. That thi= s country is unable to do what Croatia, Pakistan and Indonesia have done, r= eflects on India not on Enron.=20  f) The only signal that would go out would be positive one - to quote the q= uintessential epitome of right wing, free market thought - The Economist, w= hich wrote, at the time of the first cancellation, about ""the India that ca= n say no"".=20  g) It is more than possible to terminate the contract without any liabiliti= es in either political ('sanctity of contract') or economic ('termination l= iabilities').=20  Even currently, Enron is in severe breach of its contractual obligations. I= n any case, the condition precedent to the sanctity of the contract - the n= ecessary clearances (the CEA's techno-economic clearance) are not in place = and even an admittedly illegal ""technical"" clearance addressed to Enron sta= tes that construction on phase 2 shall not begin until GOM/MSEB ensure comp= lete absorption of power. This condition has not even been met for phase 1,=  never mind going ahead with phase 2. Enron went ahead on it's own risk des= pite being aware of the lacunae.=20  Other more substantive issues (a fraudulent tariff clearance) as well actio= n under the Prevention of Corruption Act (Section 13 (i) d) against public = servants unknown wherein the act of actually giving or taking money is not = to be proved - simply that a private party benefited at the expense of the = public exchequer (gratuitous largesse to private parties). Jayalalitha (in = the Tansi case) as well as the recent cases in the Doordarshan case come un= der this section.=20  These are avenues that ought to be pursed to bring this sorry saga to the e= nd it deserves.=20  (The writer is author of Power Play - a book on the Enron saga) -=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Tuesday, June 05, 2001=20 MSEB is willing to wheel DPC power, Vinay Bansal=20  UNDER the power purchase agreement, the DPC undertook to construct and oper= ate a baseload power station at Dabhol. At all material times, it was repre= sented to the Board that DPC would build, maintain and operate a state-of-t= he-art power station for Phase-I with a nominal baseload capacity of 670 mw= . It was represented that the power plant will have certain dynamic paramet= ers. One of the key parameters was the plant capacity to ramp up upto 100 p= er cent load within three hours.=20  Relying upon these representations the MSEB consented to the PPA. Since the=  commissioning of the Phase I plant in May '99, the DPC has been billing MS= EB for capacity payments based on the rated base-load capacity for each ava= ilability period. Until January 2001, the ramp up capacity had not come int= o question, nor was MSEB told that it was materially different from that st= ated in the contract. On January 28, '01 however, MSEB asked for 657 mw in = three hours to meet an urgent requirement. The DPC, however, could deliver = only 156 mw. There were similar defaults in February and March '01 which en= titled MSEB to rebate as per the PPA. The DPC, however, refused to pay the = rebate. Instead, in its letters, while admitting that the actual performanc= e does not conform to the contract, it has disputed MSEB's rebate claim.=20  The Board gave sufficient opportunities to resolve the issue but DPC starte= d pressurising the Board for making payments for December 2000 and January = 2001which had been adjusted against rebate that it had failed to pay. Then = it invoked guarantees of the state and central governments. Notices of arbi= tration were served. Another notice declaring Political Force Majeure was f= ollowed by instructions to our banks to activate escrow accounts. Finally, = the DPC issued two Preliminary Termination Notices on May 19, 01.=20  In the opinion of MSEB, its rebate claims are valid and its consent to the = PPA was caused by material misrepresentation. We were advised by our lawyer= s that the agreement is void and/or voidable at our option. Accordingly, th= e Board issued a notice to DPC on May 23 rescinding the contract. To avoid = inconvenience to all concerned, the Board made a very reasonable offer to t= he DPC, which was without prejudice, to continue purchase of power at old t= erms till the disputes are resolved, provided such payments were later adju= sted on the basis of determination by a competent forum.=20  But the DPC responded that the Board could not have its cake and eat too; h= aving rescinded the contract, if it continued to buy power, it would be tak= en as affirmation to hold the contract valid. Therefore, we stopped drawing=  power from the noon of May 29. MSEB has been up-to-date in payments of its=  monthly dues including the two bills adjusted against the rebate. For thei= r latest bill also, the Board sent the cheque 'under protest' on the due da= te, the May 25, but the DPC refused to take delivery.=20  Notwithstanding these differences, without prejudice to our respective stan= ds, both DPC and MSEB are seeking an amicable solution to the issue in the = forum provided by the Godbole committee. The average price of supply of DPC=  power to MSEB in the last two years has been about Rs 5.60 per unit. We dr= ew less last year because of MERC restrictions on drawal of this expensive = power and the rate for the last twelve months has climbed up to Rs 8.08 per=  unit. Since the prevailing consumer tariffs are much lower, without prejud= ice to our notice rescinding the contract, negotiations are continuing in t= he Godbole committee to reduce the DPC tariff to acceptable levels. Even to= day, the DPC is free to sell power to anyone outside the state but it is un= willing to become a merchant generator.=20  MSEB is willing to wheel DPC power. If, however, IPPs are allowed to sell p= ower within the Board's area, they will naturally choose the most profitabl= e customers, namely the HT industrial consumers. Figures show that our tari= ff structure is so distorted that the Board subsidises 9 out of 10 consumer= s. (1.18 crore customers are subsidised out of 1.30 crore). If the 10th con= sumer is taken away from the Board, its losses will mount further.=20  (The writer is chairman, Maharashtra SEB.

""We have nothing to offer,"" replied DPC spokesman = on Monday, on the eve of Dabhol lenders meeting in Singapore. Further, the fate of performance test to be carried out by DPC in the prese= nce of MSEB officials also hangs in the balance as the company has already = suspended the test runs.According to section 5.1 of power purchase agreemen= t, ""DPC shall, at least seven days before hand, give MSEB notice of and sha= ll invite MSEB's representatives to attend any performance tests, but the f= ailure of such representatives to amend will not result in the postponement=  or failure of any such tests and any tests conducted in relation to the en= try into commercial services of the liquified natural gas facility. MSEB sh= all pay DPC the commissioning charges specified in schedule 10, part VIII i= n respect of such active energy."" However, MSEB soures told The Financial Express that it has not received an= y notice from DPC on carrying out performance test. These sources said that=  even if DPC conducts performance test, MSEB would not join it on the groun= ds that it has not only rescinded the PPA but also taken up the matter with=  the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (Merc). ""The matter is s= ubjudice and thus we will not like to be present during performance test. T= he possibility of DPC going in for an expert test cannot be ruled out,"" sou= rces added. The performance test is unavoidable to avoid misdeclaration and deliver pow= er within 180 minutes from a cold start.MSEB recalled that DPC had conducte= d performance tests in May 1999 prior to ""entry into commercial service"" of=  Dabhol phase-I since May 13. The company had tested the nominal baseload c= apacity of the phase-I plant and found that it was 658.56 instead of 670 mw= , a position later accepted by DPC and MSEB. Thereafter, the rated baseload capacity was fixed at 658.56 mw for each hou= r called an ""availability period.""=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE TIMES OF INDIA, Tuesday, June 05, 2001=20 Ask DPC to pack off, demands Patkar=20 The leader of Narmada Bachao Andolan Medha Patkar on Monday demanded that E= nron's Dabhol Power Company be asked to pack off from India without any com= pensation and a judicial inquiry be instituted on all aspects of the agreem= ent with DPC.

The group denied reports that it was renegotiating the contract and the = tariff between its Indian arm, the Dabhol Power Company, and its sole custo= mer, Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). ""That is not true,"" said a= n Enron spokesman at the weekend. ""Why would we renegotiate with counter pa= rties? They are trying to imply a contract that was in place for eight year= s and operating for two years does not exist."" The denial came as Indian an= d foreign banks prepared to try to bridge their differences over sustaining=  support for Dabhol's $2.9bn power project near Bombay, which has been supp= lying the Maharashtra utility.=20 A two-day meeting in Singapore starting on Tuesday will aim to stake out co= mmon ground, which lenders hope will remove the uncertainty dogging the con= troversial 2,184MW power project. The Indian utility owes Dabhol $45m but i= s demanding in turn a greater sum in rebates for what it describes as the U= S company's failure to meet technical thresholds. Foreign lenders have stop= ped disbursing loans to the 1,444MW second phase of the project, which is d= ue for completio n soon. The 740MW first phase was commissioned in May 1999= . ABN Amro and Bank of America are some of the foreign banks that will thra= sh out the issues with State Bank of India, Industrial Development Bank of = India and ICICI.=20 People close to the talks say the situation has ""worsened"" since the last l= enders' meeting in April, when Dabhol received authorisation to quit the pr= oject. Dabhol has since issued a pre-termination notice, signalling its int= ent to withdraw in six months if a solution is not found. MSEB has responde= d to the threat by abandoning its power purchase contract with the company = and has refused to draw any more power. Dabhol has not generated any power = in the last six days. MSEB's decision to stop lifting power alarmed Indian = banks, whose exposure of funded loans and guarantees to the project totals = about $66bn, about 70 per cent of the total debt raised to finance the proj= ect. Foreign banks raised the balance of about $600m. ""There are difference= s [between the banks], even among the foreign ones. Each has a different ap= petite for risk. But I would not characterise it as a rift,"" said one parti= cipant in Tuesday's meeting.=20 Despite the tense atmosphere, power industry executives say there is an inc= reasing realisation that the banks and Dabhol must resolve their difficulti= es ""because this project is too big to fail"". Suresh Prabhu, India's power = minister, intervened last week, calling on the country's top power authorit= y to look at how Dabhol's 2184MW of power might be exported to power-defici= ent states elsewhere in India. The dispute has alarmed foreign investors an= d rating agencies. Last week, Fitch, the international rating agency, adjus= ted the outlook on India's sovereign rating of BB+ from stable to negative.=  It says central and state government guarantees - issued to support infras= tructure projects such as Enron's - amount to 9 per cent of GDP and ""are co= ntingent liabilities of the government"". Enron said at the weekend that it = was still operating and open to discussions but there needed to be some sig= n from state agencies that they were beginning ""to reverse practices of den= ying obligations under contracts"". ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Tuesday, June 05, 2001=20 Power experts get it wrong, Sanjeev S Ahluwalia=20  STATE utilities owe Rs 40,640 crore to central power generators alone. This=  is one half of their annual revenues. Overdue payments equal to eight mont= hs of revenue are sure signs of insolvency and financial unsustainability, = especially when the interest rate for incremental debt of 24 per cent is th= ree to four times the growth rate of revenue. The government of India set u= p a group of experts, chaired by Dr Montek Singh Ahluwalia, to recommend a = solution. Part one of the report was submitted in April 2001. Here is why t= he experts have gone wrong. The bulk of the overdue payments to central pow= er suppliers are the consequence of an arbitrary and ill-advised tariff inc= rease, in 1992 and again in 1998, of these central generators.=20  The allowed rate for depreciation was raised from 3.4 per cent to 7.4 per c= ent. In 1998 the allowed rate of return was increased from 12 per cent to 1= 6 per cent, even for existing plants. These measures add around Rs 2300 cro= re to the annual revenues of NTPC alone. State utilities are, however, cons= trained from passing through such increases by public pressure to keep reta= il prices low. The result has been cascading volumes of overdue payments fo= r power purchase. The Enron story and the more recent unilateral shut down = of the generation facility run by AES in Orissa, are sequels of the same ma= lady.=20  Enron is being renegotiated presumably because the costs were arbitrary. Th= e experts, however, failed to recognise a similar arbitrariness in the tari= ff increase, effected by GoI, prior to the formation of the central power r= egulator.=20  The fact is the bulk of these over-dues should be waived, as they should ne= ver have been levied in the first place.=20  State utilities face two kinds of financial challenges, which impact state = government finances. The first is tackling the overdue payments or borrowin= gs contracted to meet these liabilities. The experts have recommended that = state governments take responsibility for these overdues, by issuing bonds = in favour of the creditors. This is a welcome step towards fiscal responsib= ility, since these overdues are the contingent liability of state governmen= ts.=20  Failure to service the bonds, or failure to pay future power dues invites h= eavy censure including suspension of central transfers. These are efficient=  penalties in themselves. Where the experts have gone wrong is in ignoring = the imbalance in revenue flows while restructuring the stock of overdues. R= eforms were supposed to bridge the revenue imbalances. Firstly, Regulatory = Commissions were to raise tariffs to meet costs. Commissions, which work in=  a quasi-judicial manner and must needs safeguard the interest of the consu= mer, have justifiably baulked at passing through ``inefficient costs''.=20  The Andhra Pradesh Commission has not raised tariffs at all in 2001-2002. S= econdly, privatisation was supposed to cut costs and improve revenues. This=  has not happened. Even where the private sector has taken over distributio= n, as in Orissa, its capacity for efficiency improvements is now seen to be=  overrated. Nor is the private sector willing to finance the transition to = financial stabilisation. It is, therefore, the existing state utilities, wh= ich are now expected to provide efficiency improvements in operations. This=  a tall order.=20  In fact, the very process of `reform' provides perverse incentives to let e= fficiencies fall and the system to decay pending eventual privatisation. Th= is was the Orissa story from 1995 to 1999. The result is that most reformin= g state utilities need a bridge facility to balance the revenue budget. The=  experts have ignored this fact. By converting the overdues into equity, he= ld by central generators and Indian financial institutions and thereby faci= litating their participation in Board level management, the state utilities=  could be assured the commercial autonomy which is key to improving their p= erformance.=20  However, true `risk sharing' of this nature, which is a prospective concept= , has been ignored by the experts in favour of `loss sharing', which is a b= ackward looking concept and hence self limiting. By tackling only the stock=  and ignoring the flow of future overdues, the experts have devised a solut= ion, which is bound to fail. Let's take the case of Uttar Pradesh. This ref= orming state government has already waived Rs 20,000 crore owed by the stat= e utility to it and assumed Rs 10,000 crore of the utilities liabilities, i= ncluding unfunded pension liabilities. In addition, it provides Rs 1000 cro= re every year as subsidy and an equal amount as capital infusion. The reven= ue gap is still around Rs 1000 crore per year. Future efficiency improvemen= ts will only dilute the incremental revenue mismatch from a 7 per cent annu= al increase in supply.=20  Hence, in five years, the cumulative revenue gap, after subsidy, will be Rs=  5000 crore or double the existing level of payments overdue to central gen= erators. Against this requirement, the formula allows UP to float additiona= l bonds for only Rs 600 crore leaving an unfinanced gap of Rs 4400 crore pl= us interest on this amount. Even if UP could borrow this amount, it would i= nflate its fiscal deficit by 44 per cent. The resultant interest payments w= ould inflate its revenue deficit by 15 per cent or UP will need to cut back=  other revenue expenditure by around Rs 350 crore or 1 per cent of total re= venue expenditure.=20  UP is not the exception to this fact. States may still opt for the formula,=  despite its limitations. However, this is not an endorsement of the robust= ness of the formula but rather the helplessness of insolvent states. It is = no one's case that fiscal imbalance should become an excuse for easy money = but a package for fiscal stabilisation cannot ignore the differing base lev= els of such imbalances, both stock and flow, within the states. Incentives = and penalties are efficient only when they can induce the required fiscal r= esponse. By adopting a ``cookie cutter'' uniform approach to financial rest= ructuring, the experts have ensured that only states at the margin, or thos= e least requiring immediate assistance, will corner the lion's share of the=  assistance.=20 (The author is secretary, finance, government of UP.

Sonia, who chaired the meeting on Enron, has decided to ascertain=  the views of the Maharashtra Congress unit. ""She will go by its opinion,"" = a source close to Sonia said. A section of the Maharastra party unit wants = Sonia to take an aggressive stance and queer the pitch for Pawar, who was i= nstrumental in getting the deal through.

Regards, Darrin Donegan  Quote""  NEW WORK SOUGHT FOR RIOT-HIT GAS SHIPS  Gas exporters in Indonesia are seeking business for two LNG carriers unexpectedly left without cargoes because of the turmoil in the Indonesian province of Aceh.  LNG industry sources say Osprey Maritime's 129,000 cbm Golar Spirit (built 1981) and Leif Hoegh's 125,000 cbm Hoegh Gandria (built 1977) are sitting idle since  violence caused ExxonMobil to shut its LNG production plant at  Arun in March.  Sorces indicate the vessels were initially offered at over $90,000 per day, but say rate expectations have now been dropped to nearer $70,000 a day, despite the current shortage of available tonnage.  One report suggests that a US-based importer has fixed one of the ships for a spot cargo from Bontang in Indonesia to Lake Charles, Louisiana, but details on the prospective deal have yet to emerge.  ExxonMobil declared force majeure and shut down its onshore gas fields in Indonesia on 9 March - cutting off supplies to its Arun LNG processing plant - after security incidents and rebel activity in troubled Aceh province escalated.  Indonesian based observers say Pertamina is now keen to see Arun restarted as soon as possible.  However, they add that ExxonMobil is not optimistic about the prospects for putting its employees back in before the end of the year.  Kogas imports around 3-4 million tonnes of LNG amounting to one-fifth of its imports from Arun, and has annual contracts to import two million tonnes of LNG from Malaysia, and 700,000 tonnes from Brunei.  Kogas could be forced to look at taking supplies from the Middle East or other Asian export projects unless the Acehnese tensions are eased.  New suppliers like Yemen are emerging while existing exporters such as Malaysia, Australia, and the Middle East are expanding their capacity, creating fierce competition.

While talks are far from conclusive, the lo= cal lenders have already mooted the option of converting the 16 per cent do= llar return on equity given to Enron into a rupee-denominated return, top s= ources told ET.=20  These lenders, who perforce have taken a proactive role on the Dabhol issue= , have also revisited the proposal to partly exclude the $500 million LNG t= erminal from the $2.9 billion project to bring down thefixed cost and in th= e process the power tariff. Understandably, a rupee-denominated return (as = opposed to a dollar return allowed in the '91 power policy) has not found f= avour with Enron. But, the lenders in consent with the state and Central go= vernments are expected to raise the issue at the negotiating table. And, se= ctions think that these negotiations could emerge as a benchmark in correct= ing the Narasimha Raogovernment's liberalised power policywhich was heavily=  loaded in favour of foreign investors. The exclusion of the LNG terminal f= rom the project was a part of the Godbole Committee recommendations. While = Enron may be agree to this, analysts put a question mark on the economic vi= ability of the project, thanks to the robust and cost-effective LNG facilit= ies that Petronet is putting up in Dahej.=20  Sources said the Indian FIs' prime agenda would be to give some comfort to = the foreign lenders so as to prevent them from invoking the deferred paymen= t guarantees which the local lenders had offered against their exposures to=  Dabhol. The main overseas institutions are Miti, Japanese Exim, US Exim an= d OND of Belgium. Some of them have the accelerated invocation clause in th= eir contracts. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Monday, June 04, 2001 Duellers to the end=20                                         =20 THERE has extensive media coverage of Dabhol Power Company's disputes with = MESB, the Centre and the state  government.

Even = arbitration, or court cases, take time and their outcome is uncertain. DPC = must appreciate that MSEB is in the right on its counterclaim for the compa= ny's failure to generate optimum power within the stipulated period. But DP= C too is correct in seeking payment according to the PPA. But renegotiated = or not, the cessation of power drawal by MSEB can lead to complications. Al= so, it is drastic to treat the PPA as not being valid while a solution is b= eing sought. The legalities will matter only later, when agreement details = are redrawn afresh.=20  It will be futile to try sale of power to third parties, or even to get oth= er states to evacuate the entire 740 MW  (Phase-I) output. Both will be har= d given the backdrop of high prices which deterred MESB from timely payment= . Third party or no, few will be able to pay given the present pricing of D= PC power, plus the wheeling charges to MESB. The right approach would be to=  reduce the cost of power and delink from the dollar. DPC should accept a p= rice that does not lead to loss, even if profits are lower. FIIs could inde= ed play a role in this matter for their own good, and for DPC's.

While DPC is ready to=  cut the tariff and the internal rate of return (IRR), the lenders are will= ing to cut the interest costs, stretch the maturity period of loans and rai= se the moratorium on repayment.

With both the phases operational, DPC can avoid the embarrassmen= t of delay in generating power ""cold-start,"" ""Going by the terms of the pow= er purchase agreement, both the plants cannot be shut at the same time,"" sa= id a source. The likely cost over-run -- about 30 per cent ($450 million) -= - will be capitalised. Repayment for phase II, which is slated to commence = in 2002, may only start in 2003, thereby raising the moratorium on loan rep= ayment by one year.

There has been hardly any tan= gible progress in the negotiations. Legal notices issued by either side hav= e been flying around but the problem remains intractable. At present neithe= r DPC, nor its parent Enron, has any incentive whatsoever to hold serious n= egotiations. It is sitting pretty on an agreement that one can be sure has = been drafted by some very clever lawyers. And given that all obligations of=  MSEB are guaranteed by the Government of India, it probably is not too wor= ried about the safety of its money. It also knows that, in the interest of = its international reputation, the Indian authorities cannot afford to take = a cavalier attitude to the subject. In the circumstances, if progress is to=  be achieved, some way will have to be found to get Enron worried about the=  legal enforceability of its agreements. Only if this happens will Enron be=  persuaded to start a serious renegotiation of the tariffs.=20 In an earlier article in this newspaper (see Business Standard May 22, 2001= ), I had referred to the now famous Procter & Gamble vs Bankers Trust Compa= ny case in the United States. While I have not been able to get hold of the=  P&G plaint despite an extensive search on the Web, I have managed to get h= old of a copy of the judgement in the case. This has limitations because th= e substance of the dispute was settled out of court. And yet the judgement = does make a few useful points. The bulk of the judgement discusses arcane p= oints of law, in particular the applicability of various legislations in th= e United States to the case. On most of these points the judge has rejected=  the contentions of Procter & Gamble, and granted summary judgement in favo= ur of Bankers Trust. However, the judge goes on to argue that: ""This does n= ot mean, however, that there are no duties and obligations in their swaps t= ransactions. Plaintiff alleges that in the negotiation of the two swaps and=  in their execution, defendants failed to disclose vital information and ma= de material misrepresentations to it?=20 ""New York case law establishes an implied contractual duty to disclose in b= usiness negotiations. Such a duty may arise where 1) a party has superior k= nowledge of certain information; 2) that information is not readily availab= le to the other party; and 3) the first party knows that the second party i= s acting on the basis of mistaken knowledge?=20 ""Additional cases which explicate the duty to disclose indicate that a duty=  may arise when one party to a contract has superior knowledge which is not=  available to both parties?"" ""Even though a fiduciary duty may not exist be= tween the parties, this duty to disclose can arise independently because of=  superior knowledge?"" ""The duty to deal fairly and in good faith requires a= ffirmative action even though not expressly provided for by the agreement?""=  ""I conclude that defendants had a duty to disclose material information to=  plaintiff both before the parties entered into the swap transactions and i= n their performance, and also a duty to deal fairly and in good faith durin= g the performance of the swap transactions?""=20 The judge has cited a number of court cases in support of these points whic= h seem to be based more on case law and common law principles than on any s= pecific legislation. As such, one would imagine that the enunciated princip= les would have wider application than narrow infringements of specific laws= . In the May 22 article, I had referred to the discount factor of 17 per ce= nt per annum which seems to have been used to calculate the present value o= f the fixed cost payable by MSEB to DPC. The discount rate is an inferred o= ne from the available data; it seems that the actual rate of discount used = is not available in any of the documents. This is surprising; one obvious r= eason could be that, for what are effectively dollar payments, a 17 per cen= t discount rate is absurd and it was obviously better not to bring it on re= cord. Can its non-disclosure in the negotiation or in the agreement come un= der the various points made in the P&G vs BTC case?=20 Again, an old Business Week report on the case quotes from the P&G complain= t that it ""was bound by a pricing model which (Bankers Trust) did not discl= ose to the very party that it asserted was bound by such model..."". An exac= t parallel to the MSEB/DPC dispute?=20 A couple of other points occur to me. The Godbole Committee Report thanks I= DFC for the excellent work done as the Committee's secretariat. Having put = in a considerable degree of analytical input, as is evident from the report= , perhaps the analysts may like to try out one other exercise. This is the = projection of DPC's balance sheet at the end of the power purchase agreemen= t, on the following assumptions:=20 ?=09No dividend payment and current tax rates;=20 ?=09Dollar appreciation against the rupee of 6 per cent per annum, which is=  the actual rate of the last five years.=20 ?=09Interest on rupee surplus funds at 11 per cent per cent, and domestic i= nflation, say, 8 per cent per annum=20 The exercise would give a final value of DPC's net worth and readily permit=  the calculation of the internal rate of return on the capital invested. Ho= w does that compare with the returns in dollar terms assured by government = policy? If the return turns out to be absurdly high, as it well might, this=  could be another example of ""superior knowledge"" available to the investor=  but not made known to MSEB. This apart, in its own affidavit in one of the=  court cases, MSEB has argued why the competitive bidding process was not f= ollowed:=20 ""The competitive bid requires expert knowledge and experience for evaluatin= g the competitive bids, which at present is still not sufficiently up to th= e mark. For evaluation of such specialised projects, it is also necessary t= o have knowledge of risk identification and allocation, which is not suffic= iently developed."" As if this ""expert knowledge"" is not needed in bilateral=  negotiations! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- BUSINESS STANDARD, Monday, June 04, 2001 The Centre finally sees the light If the Centre had intervened earlier, the Dabhol crisis not have reached it= s current proportions, says P Vaidyanathan Iyer The Indian government has clearly lost the public relations battle in the E= nron controversy. A flashback to the turn of events in the last week shows = why. After months of studied indifference, the Centre suddenly started offe= ring concessions that suggest that the $ 3 billion power project may not sh= ut shop after all. A few months ago, when the crisis started, the Centre st= eadfastly refused to get involved - despite the fact that the Dabhol Power = Company (DPC) has a central government guarantee. Just about every time the=  Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) failed to honour DPC's bills, t= he Centre insisted it couldn't do anything about it. ""It is a dispute betwe= en DPC and the Maharashtra government and needs to be sorted out between th= em,"" power minister Suresh Prabhu iterated at the time. He also went on to = say that the central power utilities had the wherewithal to generate all th= e power needed for the country, suggesting that the private power producers=  were redundant.=20 But all through the pre-conciliation negotiations that followed in London a= nd in India, the Centre did little to intervene. It was only towards the en= d of May, as things started looking grimmer and grimmer that the Centre abr= uptly changed its stance. By then, Enron, Dabhol's US parent, had started s= ignalling an exit by issuing a pre-termination notice, hiring Arthur Anders= en to value its business worth in India and Jones Lang La Salle to value it= s real estate investments. Then on May 29, the situation grew worse with th= e Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission issuing an injunction restr= aining DPC from proceeding with arbitration till June 14, the next hearing = date of the negotiating committee. MERC also restrained DPC from operating = MSEB's escrow account till June 14.=20 The first signs of Centre's direct involvement came soon after K Wade Cline= , CEO, DPC flew to Delhi on May 25 to brief the power ministry on the groun= d situation in Dabhol. The same day, Prabhu met finance minister Yashwant S= inha the same day - but apparently to discuss ""power sector reforms"". The C= entre then got into the act. Just when Enron had made its mind - in line wi= th its global strategy - to pull out of the generation businesses and focus=  on trading, the Centre displayed a remarkable keenness to stop the corpora= tion from calling it quits. The government's representative on the negotiat= ing committee A V Gokak now said the Centre would play an ""active role"" in = resolving the crisis. Madhav Godbole, who had chaired the panel that re-exa= mined the project and made recommendation to correct its many anomalies, al= so said he was looking at negotiating a new deal with DPC.=20 DPC reciprocated to these placatpry noises. It now said it could cut cost b= y about 10 per cent. It was Centre's turn to ""sacrifice"" now. The power min= ister asked the Central Electricity Authority to initiate talks with power-= deficient states and check on the quantity of power they could lift from DP= C and the cost at which they could absorb it. With this decision, the Centr= e, in effect, has okayed third party sales, in line with the Godbole panel = recommendations. More ""sacrifices"" followed from the Indian banks and finan= cial institutions. IDBI, the lead Indian FI which has an exposure to the tu= ne of Rs 2,158 crore said that it was ready to cut the cost of loans (the a= verage being 16.5 per cent) by another two percentage points. All this for = Enron to stay in the 2,144 MW project.=20 It is easy to see why the Centre is bending over backwards. DPC's fate woul= d, in a sense, determine the future of foreign direct investment (FDI) in I= ndia. Reforms have progressed too far for any government to want to turn FD= I-unfriendly in global - and especially US - eyes. The point is, it's taken=  the Centre almost six months to wake up to this reality. If it had interve= ned earlier, not only would the crisis not have reached its current proport= ions, the government could have saved itself the embarrassment of going bac= k on its own words too. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Monday, June 04, 2001=20 FIs not to loan IPPs till Enron issue is resolved, Shubham Mukherjee & Jame= s Mathew=20  THE Enron imbroglio has pulled the plug on the future of all major power p= rojects, with FIs taking a stand that until the issue gets sorted out, they=  will not go in for any further disbursements to independent power producer= s for which loans have been sanctioned.=20 According to FI sources, in a recent meeting, FIs have taken a stand not to=  disburse loans for the power projects for which they have already sanction= ed debt. The development comes in the wake of mounting pressure on FIs to r= educe interest rates for the Dabhol Power Project as part of a compromise p= ackage for ending the current impasse. ""We have raised funds at a particula= r cost to lend the same to IPPs keeping a thin spread for ourselves. Now, i= f mid-way the interest rates are to be brought down, this would create a se= rious mismatch. In view of the Dabhol experience, we are now going extremel= y cautious on disbursing funds to projects for which sanctions have already=  been approved,"" top FI officials said. Significantly, the latest move of t= he FIs follows the earlier decision of FIs such as IFCI and IDBI to stop fu= nding fresh projects in the power sector. More than 50 projects are likely = to get further delayed due to the FIs posturing. FIs have also cleared loan=  for some mega projects like the 3,960-mw Hirma power project being develop= ed by Reliance and Southern Energy and the Dakshin Bharat Power project bei= ng developed by CMS and Unocal.=20 Though some of these projects are in advanced stages of operation, the deci= sion of the FIs would be a major blow on them. A section of the industry ha= s, however, questioned the stand of the FIs and have said that they cannot = go back on their intent to provide finances for projects. ""IDBI, for instan= ce, has taken a stake in S Kumars' 400-mw Maheshwar power project, how can = they refuse loan for the project?"" they asked. All the same, FIs have taken=  an in principle decision to adopt a cautious positioning and are unlikely = to decide on making further disbursements to the next crop of IPPs in a hur= ry, a senior IFCI official said. FIs have also not taken kindly to the pres= sure being mounted on them for reducing interest rates for the loan disburs= ed to the Dabhol power project to save the project. Other FIs also feel tha= t the Enron issue is a cause of great concern to the financing community an= d there is a lot of uncertainty in the power sector. Given the Enron experi= ence, it would be a tough decision for FIs to pick up projects for funding = in the future, the industry watchers said.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Saturday, 2 June, 2001 Govt working out new Enron package  IN order to sort out the payment crisis of the Enron power project, the Ce= ntre is working on a new package which will be acceptable to all the affect= ed parties. A V Gokak, the centre's representative in the negotiating commi= ttee, met the finance minister on Friday to appraise him of the solutions t= hat are being explored to get over the payment crisis. ""A solution acceptab= le to all is being contemplated. Things are moving in the right direction a= nd the government is playing a constructive role in resolving the issue,"" G= okak said.=20 According to him, none of the parties to the dispute are in favour of closu= re of the $3-billion project. According to officials in the power ministry,=  both sides are now willing to make some sacrifices which is a healthy sign= . Union power minister Suresh Prabhu earlier met the Prime Minister to disc= uss the Enron project. The power minister has already reiterated that the g= overnment would make all efforts to settle the matter in consultation with = the stake holders. Asked if any time-frame has been set to break the impass= e, Gokak said "" that the delay is in nobody's interest, but there are no re= adymade solutions either."" The negotiating committee, headed by Madhav Godb= ole, has held two rounds of negotiations. The last round held earlier this = week has been termed ""positive"" by both DPC and MSEB.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Saturday, 2 June 2001 Powerful suggestion IT'S time the government reconsidered its archaic rule mandating sale of po= wer by independent power producers to the concerned electricity board. IPPs=  must be allowed to sell power to anybody who is willing to purchase it for=  distribution or retail sale. The Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission=  has taken the lead in this direction. It is willing to let three independe= nt power producers sell power directly to consumers.=20 India's laws classify power distribution as a state subject, and all states=  say that generators have to sell power to state electricity boards, owned = by state governments. Experience shows that this can't work - most SEBs are=  broke, plagued by power theft, poor administration, graft and politically = motivated pricing. Insolvent SEBs cannot pay for the power that only they a= re allowed to purchase from IPPs. This has thrown all private power generat= ion projects into jeopardy. The real reason for the controversy over Dabhol=  Power Company is that the IPP can't be paid because the local SEB is broke= . DPC is not the only generator in trouble: the future of the 3,700 MW Hirm= a project as well as some smaller projects, are also in doubt. Today, all S= EBs together owe central power utilities about Rs 26,000 crore. Given these=  dues and the failure of most state governments to reform the SEBs, private=  investment in power generation is likely to grind to a halt. That will be = a disaster for power starved India.=20 The GERC's suggestion, if implemented by the Gujarat government - which own= s the SEB - will let IPPs become viable again.

MSEB chair= man Vinay Bansal, accounts member A Krishna Rao and state principal secreta= ry (energy) VM Lal participated in the meeting.The board asked the IFIs to = persuade the BJP-led government at the Centre for the despatch of Dabhol ph= ase-II power. The board expressed its inability to purchase Dabhol phase-II=  power at the existing tariff and said that the Centre should make all effo= rts for its disposal.

The government ne= vertheless hopes to raise growth to 8 per cent and attract FDI of $10bn, up=  from $2bn now.

The combined deficit=  of the centre and the states is 10 per cent of GDP, hardly different from = the early 1990s. Failure to address such fiscal imbalances resulted in the = change in India's rating from stable to negative by Fitch. The latest offic= ial numbers also point to a slippage from budgetary targets for 2001-2002: = the government's borrowings in April-May work out to more than half of the = target for the fiscal. Thanks to this binge, real interest rates remain hig= h; resources are crowded out for private investment and a stop-go growth cy= cle has been triggered. Last fiscal, the centre's fiscal deficit was limite= d to 5.2 per cent of GDP through cuts in spending. This is bad news for rai= sing growth, as plan capital expenditures were slashed. Additional resource= s will be available for such expenditures only if revenue deficits are cont= rolled - but this is not happening.

This is i= n addition to the penalty of Rs 760 crore slapped on Enron for misdeclarati= on of capacity.=20 The board claims that money paid to DPC since May 1999 as capacity charges = were not legitimate since the company defaulted on its declared capacity. T= his has also been incorporated in its petition filed before the Maharashtra=  Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) last week. Till April 2001, MSEB = has paid a whopping Rs 3,499 crore to Enron as bill payments. Here out of R= s 3,499 crore, the board claims that Rs 2,087 crore is paid as capacity cha= rges and since the company defaulted on capacity Rs 1,200 crore should be r= efunded to the board. However, the company has not responded to this demand=  since the penalty dispute has been referred to arbitration.

But power minister Sure= sh Prabhu had ruled out possibility of National Thermal Power Corporation (= NTPC) lifting DPC power. Prabhu had stated that the government would make a= ll efforts to settle the matter in consultation with the stake holders. Ask= ed if any timeframe had been set to break the impasse, Gokak said ""delay is=  in nobody's interest, but there are no readymade solutions."" The negotiati= ng committee, headed by Madhav Godbole, has held two rounds of negotiations=  with the last round held earlier this week being termed ""positive"" by both=  DPC and MSEB.

We are looking at all with an open mind and there are positive develo= pments,"" he said, but declined to give any further details.=20 Gokak, however, said that the government was not in favour of DPC shutting = down its operations. The thrust of the efforts was to find a solution accep= table to all concerned parties, which meant evolving a package. The seven-m= onth long wrangling between MSEB and DPC has seen the latter serving a prel= iminary termination notice while the former resorting to cancelling the pow= er purchase contract and refusing to buy any further electricity from the 7= 40 mw phase-I. 1,444 mw phase-II was to be commissioned this month but is u= nlikley to see the light of the day following MSEB's decision not to purcha= se any more power from DPC till the issue of cost of power was resolved.=20 Of late, DPC has indicated that there was a possibility of reducing cost of=  power by up to 10 per cent, but it hasn't come out with any official annou= cement to this effect.

Opposing the arbitration m= ove, MSEB said it would incur a huge cost to the board and would be a futil= e exercise since it would not be enforceable in India.=20 DPC has given notice of arbitration under clause 20 3 a of the power purcha= se agreement (PPA). This is an attempt on the part of DPC to obfuscate real=  issues and deflect attention from misrepresentations made by DPC in the PP= A, the board said. MSEB has also opposed the move of Dabhol to invoke the p= olitical force majeure clause. DPC had alleged that the government of Mahar= ashtra, the central government and MSEB had sought to frustrate the corpora= tion's obligations under the PPA. The board urged the commission to order D= PC to pay Rs 458 crore of damages due to the shortfall in supply because DP= C failure to generate energy on demand on January 28, February 13, March 29= , April 23 and May 3, 16 and 17. DPC should also pay Rs 1200 crore which it=  wrongly charged to MSEB between March 1999 and April 2001. While MSEB has = taken its battle with DPC to the commission, the trade unions in the energy=  sector, irrespective of party affiliations, have decided to take the fight=  against Enron to the streets.=20 `We expect 10,000 people to attend the demonstration in front of the Dabhol=  generation station on Tuesday,' said AB Bardhan, president of the MSEB wor= kers' federation and All India federation of electricity employees. He desc= ribed as ridiculous the offer made by Enron to reduce the tariff by 10 per = cent. This would make little sense since the tariff was steep and thoroughl= y unjustified, he said.=20 Bardhan called for scrapping the PPA with Enron. If small states like Pakis= tan and Croatia can do that there is no reason why we cannot show Enron its=  place, he said. He said Enron was involved in the energy crisis in Califor= nia and the region's governor Gary Davis had threatened to prosecute the po= wer company for its wrongdoings. ``At present in the name of renegotiations= , some people are focussing on ways to bail out Enron. The point is to resc= ue the public from the crushing burden imposed by Enron,'' he said.``It is = now being projected as a dispute between MSEB, Enron and the government wit= hout taking into account the interests of consumers and power workers and e= ngineers,'' Bardhan said. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE TIMES OF INDIA, Sunday, 3 June, 2001 PM for central initiative to salvage DPC =20 Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is understood to have asked power minis= ter Suresh Prabhu to pursue the sale of power to deficit states as part of = the efforts to help Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company.

Official sources said the meeting sought by Prabhu was = fourth in the series after the Enron controversy erupted due to payments pr= oblems seven months ago.=20 The meeting assumes importance in the wake of Maharashtra State Electricity=  Board (MSEB) refusing to buy power and challenging the validity of the pow= er purchase agreement with DPC which in turn stopped commercial electricity=  generation. While Prabhu could not be contacted for comments, government s= ources said that sale of power to other states had emerged as the only opti= on for Centre to help the troubled project as purchase of power by central = utilities was not possible. While Vajpayee wanted the project to continue, = the success of central initiative would depend on the paying capacity and r= eforms pursued by states which could be interested in buying power from DPC=  if it lowered the tariff.

(PTI)=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE TIMES OF INDIA, Sunday, 3 June 2001 SWAMINOMICS / Swaminathan S Anklesaria Aiyar The many blunders of Enron=20 The Dabhol saga goes on and on. Most commentators think that Enron took Mah= arashtra officials for a ride. This is partly true. But it is equally true = that Dabhol is a bad deal for Enron.=20 Enron's first blunder was to see liquefied natural gas as the fuel of the f= uture, clean and non-polluting. In the early 1990s, many power plants in Ja= pan and Korea came up using LNG. Coal and fuel oil were considered dirty fu= els with no future. LNG prices are linked to oil prices, and many observers=  then thought that oil would remain cheap. Enron sank billions into an LNG = project in the Gulf, to supply Israel and India. In retrospect, this emphas= is on LNG was an error. Japanese households now pay a whopping Rs 10 per un= it for power based on LNG. It is simply not the fuel of the future.=20 The second blunder was Enron's judgement in 1992 that the Maharashtra State=  Electricity Board was viable. In fact MSEB, like other SEBs, was heading d= eep into the red, with huge line losses and unsustainable subsidies. Few pe= ople remember that Enron originally did not ask for a Central counter-guara= ntee, so confident was it of MSEB's solvency. Other shrewder foreign invest= ors insisted on counter- guarantees for their proposals, and New Delhi made=  counter-guarantees a matter of policy. Enron then took advantage of this. = But note, it was saved from its own folly by other foreign investors.=20 The third blunder--arguably the worst--was to jump the gun on Phase II of t= he project. New Delhi gave no counter-guarantee for Phase II, so Enron shou= ld have made doubly sure that this was viable. The Central Electricity Auth= ority had said that MSEB should not proceed with the 1,400 MW of Phase II b= efore making sure there was enough demand for so much power. The Godbole Co= mmittee has castigated MSEB for going ahead nevertheless. Enron needs to ca= stigate its Mumbai officials no less. The 695 MW of Phase I could conceivab= ly have been absorbed with a lag, but not the 1,400 MW of Phase II.=20 The fourth blunder was the notion that clever negotiations could ensure a h= igh rate of return on equity, maybe 30 per cent. But such cleverness turns = to folly if the commercial and political risks are high. If the commercial = risks are high--if the buyer is in poor shape and cannot pay suppliers--the= n the supposedly high return will turn out to be illusory. Counter-guarante= es from sovereign entities may ease the commercial risk, but cannot elimina= te political risks, as Enron has discovered. Supposedly clever foreign inve= stors who hoped to make money out of the Hubco power project in Pakistan fo= und to their dismay that the government entity buying the power could not p= ay, and ultimately had to renegotiate the deal with a much lower margin. Th= e Paithon power project in Indonesia promised high returns to foreign inves= tors, but Indonesia's currency collapse after 1997 made the dollar-based ta= riff totally uneconomic, so the project is a write-off. The lesson for inve= stors is clear: When striving for a high return, keep in mind the buyer's c= apacity and willingness to pay.=20 The fifth blunder of Enron was to assume that it could complete the project=  within budget. Cost overruns in Indian power projects are notorious. Kawas=  I, for instance, was supposed to cost Rs 500 crore, but ended up costing R= s 1,500 crore. NTPC nevertheless made good money from it because of the cos= t-plus pricing of the time. But the Dabhol contract obliged the company to = absorb all cost overruns. Phase II has suffered an overrun of $ 400 million=  already, and this could rise if project completion is delayed (as seems li= kely). So, before getting a single dollar as dividend, Dabhol's shareholder= s have already lost $ 400 million, almost half the company's equity. So muc= h for supposedly super- profits.=20 Too many observers assume that the high price of Dabhol's power means super= -profits. Not so. Remember that the equity structure gave Enron only 50 per=  cent of Dabhol's shares, and MSEB 30 per cent. If indeed the project was s= uper-profitable, MSEB would have money pouring out of its ears. In fact the= re are no returns, only cost overruns. For want of cash, MSEB failed to tak= e up its equity share in Phase II, something it would have hardly done if t= he project was super-profitable.=20 The price of Dabhol's power is high because (a) naphtha and LNG have become=  very high-cost fuels; (b) MSEB buys barely one-third of Dabhol's power, an= d the cost of unutilised capacity is very high; (c) the project was finance= d when interest rates were very high in India (IDBI lent money at 21 per ce= nt). Renegotiating a lower return on equity will offset these factors only = modestly.=20 This looks a bad deal from Maharashtra's view today: That is well known. Bu= t it also looks a bad deal from Enron's viewpoint, and this is less well kn= own.=20 Rebecca Mark and others who launched Dabhol have left or been eased out of = Enron. Its current chief, Jeff Skilling, said some time ago that capital-in= tensive projects in oil and power (like Dabhol) constituted a poor use of s= hareholders' money. He ordered the sale of Enron's interests in oil whereve= r feasible, including in India. He switched from the production of energy t= o trading in newly deregulated sectors like electricity in the US, a switch=  that has greatly boosted profitability.=20 Indians may believe that the Dabhol contract gave super-profits to Enron. B= ut from the viewpoint of Enron's shareholders, Dabhol was a multi-faceted e= rror. It was an error to invest so much in LNG or power, an error to underp= lay the political and commercial risks involved, an error to sell power to = a monopoly buyer unable to pay its bills, an error to think that super-prof= its could be ensured by counter-guarantees and escrow accounts. Financial g= urus the world over have applauded Enron for increasing its profitability b= y getting out of energy production and into energy trading. Only in India d= o people still believe that Enron can make a lot of money by producing ener= gy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE INDIAN EXPRESS, Monday, June 04, 2001 No avoidance of legal battle: MSEB, Sanjay Jog THE Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), in no uncertain terms, told=  the Indian Financial Institutions (IFIs) that it would not be possible to = keep legal battle aside against the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) despite the = 90 per cent completion of Dabhol phase-II. In fact, MSEB made it clear that= , although it has rescinded its power purchase agreement (PPA) with DPC, it=  would continue to participate in the renegotiations ""without prejudice but=  with a positive mind."" According to MSEB sources the Indian rupee lenders led by IDBI wanted that = the MSEB should keep aside the legal battle and the Dabhol phase-II should = be completed. ""However, we made it clear to them that MSEB has certain comp= ulsions to continue its legal battle in view of various legal notices serve= d by the DPC. However, we are not opposed to the renegotiations and we will=  participate in the process without prejudice,"" sources added. MSEB made it= s stand clear at its meeting with IFI representatives held in the late even= ing on June 2. MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal, accounts member A Krishna Rao an= d state principal secretary (energy) V M Lal participated at the meeting. MSEB asked the IFIs to persuade the BJP-led government at the centre for th= e despatch of Dabhol phase-II power. MSEB expressed its inability to purcha= se Dabhol phase-II power at the existing tariff and said that the centre sh= ould make all out efforts for its disposal. The IFIs reiterated that the Da= bhol phase-II should be allowed to be fully completed and ""an alternative m= ode for distribution of power should be explored in view of MSEB's inabilit= y to absorb the phase-II power. The IFIs are believed to have explained the=  repercussions if Enron ultimately decided to pull out at this crucial stag= e. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE HINDU BUSINESS LINE, Monday, June 04, 2001 Dabhol Power Project: What next , S. Padmanabhan  ENOUGH HAS been said about the past. Whatever the blunders committed by the=  political parties, the fact remains that the Dabhol power project has not = gone away. It is a good asset, the criticism of Enron notwithstanding. The = project has been built by Bechtel and the turbines are from GE -- the two b= iggest and the best in the business. The project can serve the people of Ma= harashtra and India for the next 20 years at least.=20 Is a settlement possible on commercial lines? From Enron's point of view, t= his will mean redrawing the contracts and it would be at a great disadvanta= ge while re-negotiating the deal. For Maharashtra, it will mean reduction i= n its commitment.=20 For Enron it will a major climb down on the following issues:=20 a) At one $=3DRs 47, the project cost, as approved by the CEA, is Rs 13,294=  crore ($2,828 million) for generating 2,184 MW and the LNG terminal. This = works out to Rs 6.09 crore per MW. The LNG terminal and the power project a= re to be segregated as independent projects. Assuming a benchmark cost of R= s 3.50 crore per MW for naphtha projects, the power project segment will ha= ve to be at Rs 7,644.00 crore and the LNG plant Rs 5,650 crore. Can Enron j= ustify such a high cost for the LNG terminal (5 million tonnes)? A comparis= on will surely be made between Enron and other LNG projects such as those a= t Dahej, Mumbai, and Cochin.=20 b) The current power tariff as per the PPA is 8.8 cents (assuming the crude=  price at $28 a barrel) -- Rs 4.13 per kWh (unit) on the assumption that th= e MSEB uses 90 per cent of the 2,184 MW. Assuming a naphtha price of $290 p= er tonne and a heat rate of 1,800 Kcal per kWh utilisation, a 6.50 per cent=  rupee depreciation and an auxilliary generation of 3.50 per cent, the vari= able component (fuel cost) per unit of the power works out to Rs 2.32 and t= he fixed cost to Rs 2.11. At 90 per cent of 2,184 MW -- 17.22 billion units=  -- Enron will recover an annual fixed cost of Rs 3,633 crore ($773 million=  at one $=3DRs 47) what ever the utilisation level. When the power project = cost is reduced to Rs 7,644 crore, there has to be a corresponding reductio= n in this fixed cost also. Can Enron afford to reduce this?=20 c) Enron's LNG terminal has a 5 million tonne capacity whereas the Dabhol p= ower project will use only 2.1 million tonnes. The balance is to be sold to=  others. However, as per the PPA, Enron recovers the full fixed cost of the=  LNG project even though less than half the LNG capacity is dedicated to th= e power project. Enron will have to forego fixed cost recovery from a part = of the LNG project. Perhaps, it will have to become a dedicated LNG supplie= r to Dabhol power which position may not allow Enron to recover any guarant= eed fixed cost for its LNG segment. It will have to assume market risks. Wi= th not many projects in pipeline, where will Enron sell the balance of the = fuel?Any re-negotiation and reduction in price will show up Enron as being = weak and similarly threaten projects elsewhere. Enron knows that India is o= n a weak wicket and given its global plans of getting out of asset-based bu= sinesses, it stands to gain if it goes for arbitration. Perhaps, Enron will=  negotiate successfully a lower exit price than what it is eligible for as = per the contract.=20 For Maharashtra it is a Hobson's choice on the following issues:=20 a) The Government cannot use so much power but having agreed to grant deeme= d generation at 90 per cent capacity it cannot at this stage ask for a lowe= r capacity; at best it can ask for segregation of the project costs.=20 b) Naphtha is not an economic fuel at this time. However, LNG will also pro= ve to be uneconomic if the oil prices stay at current levels. LNG prices ar= e around $3.50 per million BTU at a base crude price of $18 and an addition= al 13 cents for every dollar increase in crude prices. Thus, at $28 to a ba= rrel, the LNG prices will be $4.80 per million BTU which translates to a fu= el cost of Rs 1.79 per kWh assuming a 2,000 kcal heat rate per kWh and one = $=3DRs 47. In addition the fixed charges will become payable.=20 c) The State Government cannot justify extending the federal guarantee to t= he LNG project -- at least on that portion which is not useful to Dabhol po= wer. Obviously, this get the lenders up in arms as they would not like to l= ose their security. Credibility will be at stake.=20 Any re-negotiation will have to result in a significant benefit for the Mah= arashtra Government politically and economically and the decision will have=  to be justified in public. The Government may not have the political will = and courage to come to a settlement and may try to pass the buck to the Cen= tre.=20 Very soon, therefore, there will be a stalled project, a cancelled PPA, arb= itration notices and the invocation of the Central guarantee and a lot of i= nternational media commentary from leading lenders and, of course, a set of=  harassed domestic financial institutions whose share prices will take a no= sedive in the medium run because of higher NPA provisioning. The Centre wil= l have to intervene to salvage its credibility arising out of the federal g= uarantee given to Enron and its lenders.=20 So where do we go?=20 A lot of people have said that there is no life after Enron envisaging a fl= ight of a large number of foreign direct investors. Perhaps, this will also=  have a serious effect on the stock market which will dive further on the d= ay of reckoning -- the day Enron cancels the PPA and invokes the federal gu= arantee.=20 Perhaps, life after Enron will be one of caution for the State and Central = governments as well as the foreign investors. The Centre will have to tread=  carefully in untangling this mess carefully. Some of the steps it may have=  to take are:=20 a) Move quickly to respond to any public criticism -- that the Centre has r= eneged on its commitments. Perhaps, the Government is already moving in thi= s direction by organising industry meets and seminars in India and abroad. b) Assure the international lenders that they are safe and that their liabi= lities would be met in full. The lenders have lent money to the project not=  out of love to Enron, but based on their analysis of India's credit rating= . They have no part in this controversy and their sensitivities must be res= pected. Fortunately, India has more than $45 billions in reserves and that = coupled with speedy action in assuring the lenders will resolve the problem= . The emphasis should be in reassuring that Enron is only one of its kind a= nd this is no across-the-board phenomenon.=20 c) A quick settlement with Enron will raise the confidence among investors.=  There has to be a greater sense of honour while retracting and recognising=  the loss -- particularly from a grave mistake.=20 d) A clear and sensible approach in dealing with the assets -- the power pr= oject and the LNG terminal. It is a useful asset built by reputed companies=  and, therefore, several players should come forward to take them over at a=  fair price.=20 e) The Centre must move fast to implement power sector reforms. We have sev= eral priorities -- primary is providing low-cost power. Experience has taug= ht us that such fuels as naphtha, or natural gas are extremely price sensit= ive in a country that imports petroleum products and, hence, power plants b= ased these fuels cannot be the mainstay. Over the last nine years we have n= ot been able to implement even one power project based on imported coal for=  fear of the fluctuating currency rates.=20 The real answer is staring at us -- developing pithead coal-fired power pla= nts. This means the projects can come up in the coal-belts of Bihar, Jharka= nd, Chhattisgarh, MP and West Bengal. The creditworthiness of these States = is not clear and, therefore, it may be necessary to get Power Trading Corpo= ration to become a proactive nodal agency for buying and distributing power=  and perhaps also act as a security provider.=20 This also means that the Centre will have to hold the hands of the investor= s for some more time in the process of developing low-cost power projects.= =20 f) Last, there has to be a move towards the reform of the State governments=  and their electricity boards. Given our experience in Balco, privatisation=  of the public and power sectors would continue to be uneasy as they are su= re to be politicised. While this cannot be avoided, we need to move ahead h= owever slow the progress. This would mean that the States may not have the = capability to support the private power projects till such time the reforms=  are introduced and till then the Centre would have to shoulder this respon= sibility to ensure an energised India. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Sunday 3 June, 2001 DPC power: Govt to pursue sales to States=20  THE Government is actively pursuing the option of identifying power-deficit=  States in its attempt to find buyers for the Dabhol Power Company power.

ECONOMIC TIMES Wednesday, 23 May, 2001, http://www.economictimes.com/today/bn01.htm Godbole quits, protests Pawar's remarks, Aditya Chatterjee=20  DR MADHAV Godbole, chairman of the Godbole Committee, appointed by the Maha= rashtra government to  renegotiate the power purchase agreement with Enron-= promoted Dabhol Power Company, has resigned after Nationalist Congress Part= y supremo Sharad Pawar implied that he was not the right person to head the=  talks. In an apparent criticism of Godbole, Pawar had said on Tuesday he w= as apprehensive about the outcome of the renegotiations ""as those leading t= he talks from the government side are working with a negative approach"". Go= dbole's resignation was in protest of this allegation. ""I have resigned due=  to derogatory remarks made against me by Nationalist Congress Party chief = Sharad Pawar on Tuesday night,"" Godbole said here. Maharashtra has a coalit= ion government, comprising the Congress and the NCP. And as the chief of NC= P, Pawar has considerable clout in Maharashtra politics.=20  Pawar was the state's chief minister when Maharashtra first signed an agree= ment with US-based power major Enron. DPC is a joint venture, with Enron as=  the majority shareholder. Enron has publicly said it was not willing to ac= cept the terms of the Godbole panel report, which had suggested a re-negoti= ation of PPA, among others. In the light of Godbole's resignation, it seems=  that Enron may have scored a vital point in its negotiation with governmen= t authorities. It is not surprising that Enron is inimical to Godbole. The = Madhav Godbole-led Energy Review Committee's report on the DPC project in M= aharashtra had blamed DPC as well its major shareholders, Enron, General El= ectric and Bechtel, for a lack of due diligence to ensure the absorption of=  the entire DPC power after phase II was complete. The report had also slam= med the role of financial institutions when it found they had exhibited poo= r  judgement and lack of due diligence in accepting these  projections with= out demur, and disbursing funds for the  phase II of the DPC project. ""The = decision of the financial institutions to fund this project seems to have b= een based primarily on the escrow account given by MSEB, the state governme= nt guarantee  and the counter guarantee by the Central government for phase=  I, rather than an independent and meticulous appraisal of the project,"" th= e Godbole report noted.=20  The same financial institutions are now vigorously lobbying  with the Centr= e to ensure Enron does not pull out of India. The Godbole Committee had als= o expressed deep concern at the apparent failure of overnance that allowed = such decisions to be taken. ""A government that takes decisions involving th= e incurring   of liabilities to the extent of over Rs 6,000 crore a year (a= nd rising) for over 20 years, in so cavalier a fashion, cannot at   the sam= e time, assert that the courts must presume it  acts in the public interest= ,"" the report noted. The crux of India's problems with Enron lies on the is= sue of whether Enron is over-charging India. The Maharashtra government say= s that when the first PPA was signed in 1994, it was assumed that the DPC w= ould  provide power at the rate of Rs 2.20 per unit, corresponding  with th= e rate of dollar at Rs 30 and cost of LNG at Rs  4,300 prevailing at that t= ime. But that criterion, unfortunately, has not been considered, and now th= e state has to pay Rs 8.54 for every unit of power.=20  State chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has gone on record to say: ``Even if=  we buy the entire power as per the agreement, the cost will be Rs 5.20 per=  unit."" Enron, of course, claims that the higher power tariff was on accoun= t of the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and the increase in w= orld fuel prices. The negotiating committee, which comprises members of the=  Godbole Committee, representatives of Enron, Maharashtra State Electricity=  Board and the Centre, was supposed to meet on Wednesday, but the meeting w= as cancelled after Godbole put in his papers.

THE ECONOMIC TIMES Wednesday, 23 May, 2001,http://www.economictimes.com/today/in04.htm 'Govt should take a stand & stand by it', Aditya Chatterjee=20  NATIONALIST Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar said on Tuesday he was appreh= ensive about the outcome of Maharashtra government's renegotiations with Da= bhol Power Company ""as those leading the talks from the government side are=  working with a negative approach"". Madhav Godbole, chairman of the negotia= ting committee, put in his papers in protest. Godbole spoke to Aditya Chatt= erjee of Times Internet Network about what led to his resignation. Excerpts= :=20  You were appointed the negotiating committee chairman by the Maharashtra go= vernment to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the Enron-promote= d Dabhol Power Company. A key member of the  government has now criticised = you. Do you feel being let down?=20 The government should learn to first take a stand and then stand by it. As = you rightly pointed out, the Maharashtra government had appointed me as the=  committee head. And now, an important constituent of the government has al= leged that the negotiating committee has a negative attitude. This type of = a statement weakens the committee's stand on the crucial issue of negotiati= ng the power purchase agreement with DPC. The government should try to give=  all the support to the committee and help strengthen it. Tuesday's comment= s by the senior NCP leader is counter-productive in this light. I have resi= gned because if the state government is not able  to place its full trust o= n my capabilities, there's no reason  for me to stay on. Therefore, I sent = my resignation to the chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh.=20  Sharad Pawar was the chief minister of Maharashtra when the state first sig= ned an agreement with US-based power major Enron in 1993-94. You were also = regarded as the thorn in Enron's flesh. In fact, Enron has publicly said it=  was not willing to accept the terms of your committee report. Doesn't your=   resignation, in effect, help out Enron and its supporters?=20 I would not like to comment on this. It's for you to decide. But, the outco= me of the negotiation will be decided by the kind of panel that the governm= ent constitutes. Hopefully, the committee will have a positive attitude thi= s time.=20  Is your decision to resign final or will you consider withdrawing the lette= r if the state government requests you to continue?=20 I haven't considered this issue at this point of time. Sharad Pawar did not=  specifically name you in his statement. He actually blamed the entire comm= ittee for having a negative approach. Do you think other conscientious memb= ers of the Godbole committee will now follow your lead and put in their pap= ers? That is a possibility. But, it's for the other members to decide.=20  What is your future plan of action?=20 Well, I will continue working on the report which involves the phase-II of = the DPC project and the restructuring the  operations of the Maharashtra St= ate Electricity Board. The report will be completed over the next 10 days.  THE ECONOMIC TIMES Wednesday, 23 May, 2001,http://www.economictimes.com/today/in03.htm Should India pull the plug on Enron?, Aditya Chatterjee & Pooja Kothari=20  THE Indian think-tank needs to quickly put their minds together in finding = an amicable solution to the current Enron-Dabhol Power Company-Maharashtra = government imbroglio and resolve the crisis which has risen over non-paymen= t of electricity bills. If the two sides reach an understanding, it will be=  the best   case scenario. If not, India has to think whether to continue w= ith a cancerous limb, or to simply cut it off to prevent further damage.=20  The Maharashtra government has entrusted the Madhav Godbole panel with the = responsibility of negotiating a new power purchase agreement with Enron. Th= e panel would do well, if it takes into account the following. If Enron doe= s pull the plugs on DPC, the central government will have to cough up a sum=  of Rs 2,910 crore - which constitutes a penalty amount of Rs 1,500 crore f= or one year of electricity bill, and $300 million as termination  fees (whi= ch, at $1=3DRs 47, is equal to Rs 1,410 crore). This is a one-time payment,=  and the final figure of Rs 2,910  crore is certified by Union power secret= ary A K Basu.=20  Now, instead of terminating the DPC project, if India were to continue with=  the present arrangement and keep paying Rs 1,500 crore per year for the ne= xt ten years to DPC, the net present value of this investment works out to = a whopping Rs 9,217 crore, which is nearly three times the price that India=  pays - if DPC is terminated. The NPV was calculated on the basis of Rs 2,9= 10 crore  being put in a fixed deposit for 10 years, and the deposit earnin= g an interest rate of 10 per cent every year. However, another issue that a= lso needs to be taken into account is the exposure of the Indian financial = institutions and banks. FIs, led by the Industrial Development Bank of Indi= a, have, in two phases, provided loans of $ 95 million and $ 333 million, m= aking their total exposure equal to $428 million (which, at $1=3DRs 47, is = equal to Rs 2,012 crore). This apart, SBI also underwrote the maximum porti= on of a $557 million cross-border loan, and have an exposure of about $175 = million (or Rs 823 crore).=20  Thus, the cumulative exposure of the Indian banks and financial institution= s in DPC works out to Rs 2,835 crore. However, since only 80 per cent of th= is amount has been disbursed so far and FIs have tightened their purse stri= ngs of late, the net exposure of Indian lenders in DPC works out to Rs 2,26= 8 crore. Since the Indian lenders are not covered by any counter-guarantee,=  their bottomline would take a hit if Enron backed out of this project. The=  government being a  majority stakeholder in most of these institutions, wo= uld also take a hit on account of these losses. If all these loans are take= n into account, and added to the one-time payment of Rs 2,910 crore, the to= tal cost to government would be Rs 5,178 crore - which is still lower than = Rs 9,217 crore (the price India will pay to DPC, if the nation is to contin= ue with the present arrangement of paying Rs 1,500 crore per year over the = next ten years). Thus, going by the current scenario where a compromise see= ms like a very far-fetched option, the termination option will be a less co= stly one for the nation.=20  However, the question which arises then is what happens to the assets and t= he plant in case of a termination. Well,  the government can sell it to pri= vate power players and  re-negotiate the cost factor with them - this time = hopefully  after doing a cost-benefit analysis! A sale of assets would also=  lessen the load on the government. Who knows - the government may actually=  strike a deal with another private sector player to sell the ownership of = DPC at a premium? Now, for our fears that cancelling the project might cost=  us future foreign direct investment since Enron is the biggest investor in=  India so far. Compare this - while Brazil raised $31 billion and China $49=  billion last year alone in foreign direct investment, how  much FDI can In= dia, with its annual inflow of about $4  billion, really lose? In short, it= 's a case of losing what you don't have in the first place. The Godbole pan= el would also do well to note that many developing nations, who were pushed=  into signing expensive power projects by power MNCs, have  successfully re= -negotiated their contracts with no serious  financial consequences.=20  Many nations simply did not have the money to pay for the  inflated bills, = some refused to pay even after losing international arbitration awards, whi= le some others like Costa Rica declared that the 15 contracts signed with I= ndependent Power Producers (like Enron) have no legal  status or are bad in=  law. There are others too.=20  * In July 1999, the Hungarian parliament declared that a PPA signed with mu= ltinational RWE was unconstitutional and void.=20  * In August 2000, the Croatian government insisted on  tearing up a PPA sig= ned by Enron with a previous  government. The contract was considered to be=  unaffordable, and was allegedly signed in politically  dubious circumstanc= es. Enron subsequently abandoned the original agreement.=20  * In September 2000, the Philippines government took a decision of not rene= wing contracts with IPPs. This was done to avert the excessive financial bu= rden caused by these deals.=20  The Enron project was always mired in controversy. One has seen how the Shi= v Sena-BJP combine had thundered during 1994 election campaigns that they w= ould ""throw the Enron project in the Arabian Sea"". Now, of course, the same=  BJP-led government at the Centre is bending backwards to prevent Enron fro= m packing its bags. One can understand the predicament of the Indian politi= cians. The MNC was the biggest contributor to the campaign fund of US presi= dent George Bush and has the high profile former US ambassador to India, Fr= ank Wisner among its  board of directors.=20  In a sense, the fondness of the government for Enron is not surprising at a= ll since the Sena-BJP government of Maharashtra had taken pride for `succes= sfully' negotiating with Enron to increase the total output of the project = where an additional 1,444 mw was added to the 740 mw DPC project. It's a di= fferent matter that as of date, neither Maharashtra can consume all of DPC'= s 740 mw produce, nor it has the money to pay the bills. The crux of India'= s problems with Enron lies on the issue of whether Enron is over-charging I= ndia.=20  The Maharashtra government says that when the first power purchase agreemen= t was signed in 1994, it was assumed that the Enron-sponsored DPC would pro= vide  power at the rate of Rs 2.20 per unit, corresponding with  the rate o= f dollar at Rs 30 and cost of LNG at Rs 4,300  prevailing at that time. But=  that criteria, unfortunately, has not been considered, and now the state h= as to pay Rs 8.54 for every unit of power. In fact, the state chief ministe= r Vilasrao Deshmukh  has gone on record to say: ``Even if we buy the entire= =20 power as per the agreement, the cost will be Rs 5.20 per  unit.""=20  Enron, of course, claims that the higher power tariff was on account of the=  depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and the increase in world fue= l prices. Even during the first days of the Enron project, there were  enou= gh warnings from sensible quarters. For instance, in  August 1994, the then=  Union finance secretary had written  to the power secretary that that the = size of ""the potential liability for a 1,000 MW plant, was around Rs 3,000 = crore per year"". The department of economic affairs had also expressed a fe= ar that the ""...risk of the counter guarantees being invoked was not unreal= , given that SEBs had been defaulting in payments..."". Caution was thrown t= o the winds then. The least India can do now is to ask for a re-negotiation= . The question is does the Indian government have the guts to threaten a ca= ncellation and force Enron to re-negotiate?

FIs and banks have already disbursed over Rs 1,700 crore out of its total c= ommitments of around Rs 2,000 crore.

THE INDIAN EXPRESS Wednesday, 23 May, 2001,http://www.indian-express.com/ie20010523/bus2.html Indian power firms not keen on buying DPC, Dev Chatterjee  Leading Indian power companies have ruled out buying Enron Corp's stake in = Dabhol Power Company if the project comes up for sale. The reason, say powe= r company officials, is the high power tariff. ''None of the state governme= nt or consumer will buy power at the prevailing power tariff,'' say officia= ls of leading power companies. ''If the project is up for sale, there is no=  question of us buying Enron's stake in Dabhol Power Corporation. We think = the power tariff of over Rs 7 is too high and it would be difficult for us = to find any buyers,'' said a top Tata Power official. ''The PPA has to be r= e-negotiated and tariff brought down,'' he added.  Tata Power had taken over the Mangalore power project after US energy giant= , Cogentrix had withdrawn from the project. According to sources, the compa= ny will now invest its time and funds into 1000 mw coal-based Mangalore pow= er project instead of taking over new power projects like DPC. ''There are = reports that Karnataka government wants to have re-look at the Mangalore po= wer project PPA, we are busy with that,'' said Tata Power official. Tata Po= wer is one of India's largest power generation and distribution companies a= nd is considered a likely suitor for the DPC.  Reliance Industries, which was setting up a 450 mw power project in Patalga= nga near Mumbai, has also expressed its reservations about taking over the = project. In its post-annual results news conference, Anil Ambani managing d= irector of RIL had said that the company is not keen on buying Enron's stak= e in DPC. RIL also owns 29.68 per cent equity in BSES which has its own dis= tribution and power  generation capacity for Mumbai suburbs.Power sector an= alysts say only the cash-rich Union government utilities have the cash to t= akeover Enron power project but it would be difficult for them to sell powe= r to other States unless some solution is hammered out between Enron, and M= aharashtra government over the tariff. Already Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh= , though facing major power cuts, have ruled out buying power from MSEB at = the stiff rate.  Similarly, Maharashtra is a power deficit project but it is unable to lift = power from Enron project as the state electricity board is unable to pay En= ron bills due to its bankrupt balance sheet.MSEB has said the power produce= d by $ 2.7 billion Dabhol power project is expensive and has refused to buy=  the output from the second phase. The contract between the two signed in t= he mid-1990s had called for MSEB to buy the entire capacity of 2,184 MW.

Mr Vahanvati said that the DPC has solemnly undertaken to operate the Dabho= l plant in accordance with the dynamic parameters and it was binding on the=  company to specify a variation in the Availability Declaration in the prep= aration time required to commence start-up procedure. ""No such thing was do= ne in the Availability Declaration,"" he added.On January 28, 2001, although=  DPC had declared the baseload capacity of 657 mw, the actual generation of=  mere 156 mw against the MSEB's instructed capacity of 657 mw during 6 pm t= o 7 pm. During 7 pm to 8 pm, the actual generation was 325 mw, against the = declared baseload capacity and instructed capacities of 657 mw, during 9 to=  10 pm, the actual generation was 325 mw against the declared and instructe= d capacities of 657 mw and during 11 pm to 12 am, the actual generation was=  450 mw against the declared and instructed capacities of 657 mw.""The momen= t there was a shortfall, apart from anything else, Clasue 10.2 of the power=  purchase agreement (PPA), which deals with availability, rebates and bonus= es, came into operation,"" Mr Vahanvati opined.  According to him, DPC in its communication on February 1 to MSEB, has conce= ded that it has breached its obligations, but ""that it has not done so know= ingly."" ""One wonders how such a statement could be made, having regard to t= he confession that 180 minutes is insufficient to bring the plant to 657 mw= . If this was an obligation and if DPC gave its Availability Declaration co= ntrary to this, there could be no doubt that it did so knowingly,"" he added= .Mr Vahanvati said that the DPC could have made changes to the Availability=  Declaration under article 3.4, but it did not do so. Clauses 6.1 and 6.2 o= f Schedule 6 also reiterate the importance of the dynamic parameters, since=  they provide that the DPC could not be required to operate the plant other= wise than within the Availability Declaration or the Dynamic parameters. Th= e company in another letter on February 14, admitted that the actual perfor= mance capability of the Dabhol plant is not in accordance with what is stat= ed in the PPA.  Mr Vahanvati said that the rebate has to be adjusted and the contract provi= des for billing in terms of payment in Clause 11. The billing statement has=  to contain the computation of rebate in accordance with Clasue 10.2.

While Jones Lang La Salle will assess all th= e real estate investments of Enron in India, Arthur Andersen will value the=  business worth of the Houston-based energy major's Indian set-up. When con= tacted, a company spokesperson declined to comment. ""Nobody in Enron will t= alk about it,"" he said. However, sour- ces said the appointment of consulta= nts was in line with Enron's strategic decision of pulling out of the 2,144=  mw power venture which has been mired in controversy from day one.=20  According to sources, Enron's real estate investments have taken a big hit.=  ""Enron invested in prime real estate during 1992-1995 when the prices were=  at a peak. However, they have touched more realistic levels now,"" said a r= eal estate consultant.Jones Lang La Salle is, however, tight-lipped about s= uch a mandate from Enron. Meanwhile, sources said that Cushman & Wakefield = which had earlier finalised certain real estate investments for Enron was a= lso in the race.=20  CB Richard Ellis has also proposed certain clients to Enron for buying/leas= ing some of its property. Enron's Houston-based president Jeffrey Skilling = had in February said in an interview to Business Week that Enron ""should no= t be in there (India) building $2 billion power plants. Our cost of capital=  is too high for that."" DPC had disregarded the contents of the Godbole Com= mittee report when it issued a preliminary termination notice to MSEB on Ma= y 19. The PTN gives DPC, MSEB, the state government and the Centre six mont= hs to resolve the issue amicably. If the talks fail, DPC would issue the fi= nal termination notice. Enron India had earlier this year also decided to a= bandon the proposed joint venture with MSEB and Global Telesystems for a br= oadband network in Maharashtra.=20   BUSINESS STANDARD Wednesday, 23 May, 2001,http://www.business-standard.com/today/financ12.asp= ?Menu=3D5 DPC imbroglio: Rs 5,255 crore at stake for Indian lenders, Tamal Bandyopadh= yay in Mumbai  The three Indian lenders to the Dabhol Power Company -Industrial Developmen= t Bank of India, State Bank of India and ICICI-may take a hit of Rs 3,000 c= rore on account of the deferred payment guarantee (DPG), given to foreign l= enders in case they decide to trigger the accelerable guarantee clause in t= he wake of the preliminary termination notice (PTN). Also at stake is the I= ndian lenders' Rs 2,255 crore in term loans outstanding for both phases of = the controversial $3 billion project.  Bankers are lobbying hard with the finance ministry to defuse the crisis. I= f the ministry continues with its ""indifference,"" banks may collectively st= ay away from core sector lending in future. Indian banks have also decided = not to attend the lenders' meet in Singapore, called in the first week of J= une to take stock of the situation.In phase I of the project, the outstandi= ng US Exim loan is $221 million, backed by the guarantees of IDBI, ICICI an= d SBI. In rupee terms (exchange rate of Rs 47 per dollar), it works out to = Rs 1,039 crore.=20  For phase II, IDBI, ICICI and SBI have given guarantees to OND's (a Belgian=  bank) $64 million, Miti's $143 million and J-Exim's $210 million (Rs 1,960=  crore).If the accelerable guarantee is invoked, Indian financial intermedi= aries will face a massive cash flow problem. Their capital adequacy ratio (= CAR) will go down as the risk weightage to loans is 100 per cent, against 5= 0 per cent risk weightage of guarantees. The outstanding rupee loans on Ind= ian lenders' books for phase-I is around $53 million (Rs 249 crore) with ID= BI taking the lead with $26 million, ICICI, SBI and Industrial Finance Corp= oration of India $7 million each and Canara Bank $3 million.=20  BankAm's Indian office also has a $3 million exposure to phase I. SBI has d= isbursed $141 million worth of foreign exchange loans for phase-II and Cana= ra Bank $40 million. The rupee loan for this phase is pegged at $246 millio= n (Rs 1,156 crore). Here, ICICI has the highest exposure ($93 million), fol= lowed by IDBI ($83 million), SBI ($37 million), Canara Bank ($17 million) a= nd IFCI ($16 million).""It is too early to speculate on the fate of our expo= sure. This is backed by assets,"" said an institutional source. Bankers said=  the company can pay the dues up to September but if DPC's activities come = to a halt, problems could surface later. Indian lenders are not covered by = the Centre's counter-guarantee.=20  BUSINESS STANDARD Wednesday, 23 May, 2001,http://www.business-standard.com/today/opinion5.asp= ?menu=3D8 'An inexcusable failure of governance'  An extract from the first part of the Godbole Committee report on Dabhol Po= wer Company suggests that the project was based on questionable assumptions= The Dabhol project has generated a lot of controversy in the past and till = the date of the constitution of the committee, there have been a number of = public interest litigations filed against DPC [Dabhol Power Company] on var= ious counts. Even during the tenure of the Committee, fresh petition have b= een admitted and are under consideration of the Bombay High Court.=20  However, none of the earlier petitions have found favour with the courts. E= ven the one case that is still pending before the Supreme Court, has been r= etained because of the conduct of the GoM [Government of Maharashtra] in fi= rst filing an affidavit and then disclaiming it. Whenever the history of pu= blic interest litigation is written, this will be recognised as one of the = failures of the process. One would presume that with such judicial scrutiny= , all the issues in the project would have been examined thoroughly. Unfort= unately,...this is far from true. The fault does not lie with the court but=  with inexcusable failure of governance... The case against DPC was argued = extensively at least in two major writ petitions before the Bombay High Cou= rt. In these two critical cases, viz, the Ramdas Nayak case and the CITU ca= se, various Government agencies argued forcefully...that DPC was in the pub= lic interest; that the contract could not have been awarded through competi= tive bidding but it was negotiated hard and long in order to obtain a benef= icial outcome, that the design and size of the project was appropriate, and=  that the tariff was competitive and below the norms set by the Government = of India and that all these issues had been examined by the appropriate aut= horities as required under law.=20  The various agencies submitting affidavits and arguments to this effect inc= luded GoM, MSEB [Maharashtra State Electricity Board], Ministry of Power, G= oI [Government of India] and the CEA [Central Electricity Authority]. In bo= th these cases as also several other cases filed against DPC, the Court did=  not consider it appropriate to intervene. In the Ramdas Nayak case, the co= urt observed that, ""It is well accepted legal position today that judicial = review is not an appeal from a decision but a review of the manner in which=  a decision was made. ...The function of the Court is to see that lawful au= thority is not abused; while doing so, it should arrogate itself the task e= ntrusted to that authority...The Court should not enter into the merits of = Government actions, more so in economic matters unless the same is unreason= able and is not in public interest... But at the same time the Court can ce= rtainly examine whether a decision making process was reasonable, rational,=  not arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.""=20  The Committee believes that this report brings out these very concerns and = shows in no uncertain terms that the decision-making process violated all t= hese salutary principles, i.e, it was neither reasonable [nor] rational....=  The Committee is surprised at the breadth of governance failure , which ha= s occurred across time, across governments and across agencies, right from = 1992 till as late as 1999...This chapter will show that every one of the as= sertions, relating to the benefits from the project, viz., the effectivenes= s of negotiations, its design and size, the need for power and competitiven= ess of tariff, for both Phase I and Phase II, have proven to be false and i= ndeed, were based, at the time of the assertions on extremely questionable = assumptions.=20  The Committee, in the short time allocated to it, is unable to determine re= asons for this consistent lapse in governance but is extremely concerned at=  it. Two members of the Committee, namely Dr Godbole and Dr Sarma, felt tha= t, prima facie, the manner in which each and every opportunity was exploite= d by those favouring the entry of DPC at different points of time, against = the interests of MSEB, the interests of the Maharashtra consumer and the pe= ople of Maharashtra raises doubts about a concerted effort to exercise undu= e influence at every stage in this project. ... One of the persistent issue= s has been the lack of competitive bidding. ... The GoM had chosen consciou= sly to enter into negotiations, instead of going by the competitive bidding=  route and it justified this course of action and insisted that it had cond= ucted intense negotiations before signing the contract. Both the justificat= ion and quality of these negotiations are suspect. ...[O]n the issue of com= petitive bidding, it was affirmed (by GoM through MSEB) that this was not r= elevant, counter-productive and inappropriate. Perhaps the only accurate st= atement was it was not unlawful. For reasons detailed below, the Committee = finds each of these reason to be deficient and suspect. ""Not relevant"": GoM=  said that the ""competitive bidding procedure [was] relevant when the Gover= nment or public authority [was] either disposing of or purchasing property = or services. It [had] no relevance to cases where a private party chooses t= o set up a project on its own with its own resources"" [affidavit by MSEB in=  Ramdas Nayak dated 25 July 1994].=20  This depiction of DPC as an investment with no obligation on either the ""Go= vernment or public authority"" to purchase services was patently in error. T= he GoM resolution extending a guarantee to DPC dated 10th February 1994 cle= arly mentions that ""As MSEB will purchase power from DPC, it has to execute=  an agreement, namely Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)"". ""Counterproductive"":=  This is a very interesting statement, which suggests that ""major companies=  should not be asked to compete for projects. The Committee believes that t= he vacuity of such an argument is self-evident and does not merit further c= onsideration. Inappropriate"": This is a surprising statement, for it admits=  that GoM's ""expert knowledge and experience"" for evaluating bids is ""not s= ufficiently up to the mark"" and that its ""knowledge of risk identification = and allocation...is also not sufficiently developed."" At the same time, how= ever, GoM argues that it has the expertise, experience and knowledge to neg= otiate a contract.=20  It is apparent to the Committee that if a body is not qualified to evaluate=  bids, which are submitted on standard terms, it is evidently less qualifie= d to negotiate minute details of a similar project. This dissonance between=  the two bodies of knowledge as perceived by GoM is inexplicable. If the ar= gument is that the MSEB had engaged international financial and legal advis= er to assist it in its negotiation with DPC, the same could have been done = with respect to preparation and evaluation of bid documents.=20  'Enron revisited, Enron saw and Enron conquered'=20  The Bombay High Court, in writ petition No 2416 of 1996 in CITU and Abhay M= ehta vs DPC and others, observes the following regarding the renegotiations=  of the project in 1995: "" But once it [GOM] decided to revive the project,=  it acted in the very same manner in which its predecessor in office had do= ne. It forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency. The only tran= sparency it claims is the constitution of the negotiating group. The speed = with which the negotiating group studied the project, made a proposals for = renegotiations which was accepted by Dabhol, and submitted its reports is u= nprecedented.The negotiating group was constituted by the Government of Mah= arashtra on 8th November 1995. It was asked to submit its report to the sta= te governmentby 7th December 1995. The committee, we are told, examined the=  project, collected data on various similar other projects as well as inter= nal bids including data on a similar project executed by Enron in the UK, h= eld considerable negotiations, settled the terms of revival of the project,=  got the consent of Enron and Dabhol to the same on 15th November 1995, jus= t within a week of its constitution and submitted its exhaustive report ...=  on 19th November, 1995, just 11days after its formation, much before the 7= th December....The speed at which the whole thing was done by the negotiati= ng group is unprecedented. What would stop one to say, as was said by the C= hief Minister in the context of the original PPA, ""Enron revisited, Enron s= aw and Enron conquered - much more than=20 it did earlier"".""=20  (To be continued tomorrow)=20  BUSINESS STANDARD Wednesday, 23 May, 2001,http://www.business-standard.com/today/economy6.asp= ?Menu=3D3 DPC tangle: Centre adopts wait & watch policy, Subhomoy Bhattacharjee & San= tosh Tiwary in New Delhi  The Centre will await the outcome of the conciliation proceedings before de= ciding on its next step about the Dabhol Power Company. Talking to Business=  Standard senior finance ministry officials said the central government rep= resentative AV Gokak has already been suitably briefed about the affair, an= d the centre is looking forward to the outcome of the proceedings. The sour= ces said since the preliminary termination notice (PTN) has been sent by DP= C to the Maharashtra government the Centre cannot take a stand on the issue=  without the state asking it to intervene.=20  They also said since there is a mandatory time period of six months between=  the serving of a PTN and the implementation of the same, the conciliation = can proceed. Officials of the finance and power ministries have meetings wi= th Gokak last week to sieve through the entire legal position between the c= ompany, the state and the central governments. However, they agreed that th= e conciliation proceedings cover a very small portion of the dispute involv= ing only the pending bills of DPC for December amounting to Rs 103 crore an= d will not solve the entire issue of electricity purchase between the compa= ny and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board.  Since the bills for the successive months have also run into problems it ha= s created the possibility that the project may be terminated. Though the so= urces said that since the company has already invested a substantial sum fo= r the second phase, it will not be very keen to withdraw from India abruptl= y.Incidentally the Godbole committee for renegotiating the power purchase a= greement with DPC is slated to meet tomorrow in Mumbai.The officials also s= aid that though the lenders to the project, which includes IDBI have approa= ched the finance ministry to enquire about the stand of the centre, they ha= ve been told that the Centre can do very little about it.This is because th= e contract as drawn up is between the Maharashtra government and the DPC wi= th the Centre only standing as a counter guarantor.  The wait and watch policy of the Centre is also dictated by the political c= ompulsions, with the centre deciding to let the state government do all the=  talking. The total amount of guarantee that will come into play if the pro= ject is terminated is about $300 million. Since the second phase of the pro= ject does not involve any further counter guarantee the liability for the g= overnment will not rise.

They are in the process of blinding off the coil and estimate being back to full speed within 7 hours of right now (right now being 1:30 pm our time).  With this in mind, their new ETA to the Lake Charles buoy is 10:00 on the 9th.  That would put them at the dock approximately 16:00 on the 9th.  I would guess that the ship tour could not begin until approximately 6:00 to 8:00 pm on the 9th given this schedule.  This schedule is still tentative and I will pass on more updates as I get them.

2022-04-20 18:32:11+00:00,true,6,"  I would like for us to take a look at charging Peerless some sort of number based on the market price for leased storage.  I talked to a guy in the Enron liquids group who said that 2-oil tankage in the Caribbean goes for about $0.25- $0.30 per barrel per month.  If we leased them only 150,000 bbls of capacity in the tank and kept the rest for ourselves, that would be around $40,000/month.  The actual number could be whatever we are comfortable with keeping in storage as minimums.  If we could get something out of it every month and still sell them our inventory that would be great.  But I would also like to know how it looks in case they wouldn't go for that and we had to hold title to whatever oil we already have in the tank. Then we could still have some sort of pricing mechanism for buying and selling oil to each other in the tank.  From what I heard from Peerless, they would plan to unload vessels into Eco's tank, then transfer out of that tank to their other tanks when needed.  Whatever the case would be, we would have to have controls on quality in our tank, and insist on seeing the analysis on everything before it goes into the tank.

2022-04-20 22:48:08+00:00,true,6,"  I've clarified the language in 2(a).  Paul / Dan:  A summary of the alternatives related to the LNG winter cargo follows:   1. If we don't do anything and Cabot does not deliver:    a. We may save $4.7 million in demand charges and surcharges, but will have exposure to spot fuel prices at a time when prices are expected to rise.   2. Write a letter to Cabot notifying them that we have an opportunity to secure a winter cargo now and have them confirm their commitment to a winter cargo delivery.     a. Should Cabot commit to a winter cargo we would be in the same position we are today with the exception that they no longer have the ability to cancel the winter cargo on short notice. If we later decline to receive the winter cargo we still pay the $4.7 million in demand charge and surcharge. We would decline to nominate a winter cargo from Cabot only if spot fuel prices are lower than the commodity charge and surcharge.          b. Should Cabot not commit to a delivery we are relieved of the obligation to pay the $4.7 million in demand charges and surcharges and can buy a spot cargo at an additional savings. The total potential benefit to EcoElectrica of the transaction can be close to $5 million at the current LNG prices (this scenario will be better if prices go down)..  Given where the LNG market is today we should proceed to send the letter to Cabot.  ","I've clarified the language in 2(a).

We have had some problems with one of the feed water pumps lately.  Needed spare parts for this type of feed water pump are difficult to get and the delivery time is very long.

Unfortunately we learned this morning that the transporter has made some mistakes and the pump will not arrive Algeciras before tomorrow at 1100.

(PTI)  THE ECONOMIC TIMES Monday, 21 MAy, 2001,http://www.economictimes.com/today/21econ04.htm Dabhol project suffers $400-m cost overruns, Anto T Joseph=20  AS IF the current dispute with the Maharashtra government was not enough, t= he Dabhol project now has to deal with cost overruns. The Enron-promoted Da= bhol Power Company has experienced a cost overruns to the tune of $400 mill= ion, taking the total project cost to $3.3 billion. DPC, which issued a pre= liminary termination notice to Maharashtra State Electricity Board on Satur= day (May 19), is in a fix as both domestic and offshore lenders have refuse= d to increase their exposure in the controversial power project, the larges= t-ever foreign direct investment, so  far, in India. After Indian lenders s= topped disbursements as a fallout of a long payment crisis, DPC is believed=  to have scouted for foreign debt, albeit unsuccessfully, to maintain the d= ebt-equity status quo at 70:30 ratio. DPC's issuance of PTN has compounded = the problem. According to the power purchase agreement between the MSEB and=  Enron, issuing a PTN would mean fixing a deadline of six months for pullin= g the final plug on the project. ""As of now, the FIs have held back $250-mi= llion debt to the project. Once the PTN is served, DPC can't expect lenders=  to make any more disbursements, and it has almost sealed the fate of the p= roject,"" said a financial institution source.=20  While the 740-mw phase I is operational, the second phase of 1,144 mw was e= xpected to be fully operational by the year-end. One unit of 740 mw (part o= f the second phase) is undergoing trial-runs, and was expected to be commer= cially operational in June. Sources said the huge cost overruns had been a = major deterrent in project completion. Worried by the mounting payment defa= ults, the EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contractor of the=  project -- Bechtel - is  believed to have threatened to pull out of the pr= oject by  mid-June. The cost overruns stem from devaluation of the rupee vi= s-a-vis the dollar and an increase in equipment cost. Indian FIs are now wa= ry of further cost overruns owing to the delay in project execution. ""India= n FIs, who have contributed 40 per cent of $2.9 billion (earlier project co= st), had refused to take more exposure.  DPC was forced to approach foreign lenders for raising funds to cover the c= ost overruns. They have also taken a negative stand,"" said sources. The ABN= -AMRO led offshore consortium is believed to have refused to contribute any=  more debt to the project. The only way out for DPC is for the promoters to=  increase  their equity contributions. Proportionately, Enron, which holds = around 65 per cent in DPC, will have to shell out a  major chunk if this we= re to happen. DPC's move to issue PTN has considerably irked Indian institu= tions. Lenders were planning to cast a confidential vote on PTN this week. = However, armed with the required mandate from offshore lenders, DPC went ah= ead and issued the PTN.

Earlier, MSEB had slapped a Rs 401-crore penalty on DPC for ""not generating= "" required power to meet the demand on January 28. DPC had yesterday issued=  a PTN to MSEB,  saying the loss-making board, the state  government and th= e Centre had failed to meet their contractual obligations and therefore it = had  no choice ""but to issue the notice."" Meanwhile, DPC is also attending = the next meeting of the Godbole panel on Wednesday. =20 =20 Enron India managing director Wade Cline confirmed that the power company h= as not  closed its doors to negotiate a satisfactory  solution. But state g= overnment officials said the onus of finding a workable solution is now wit= h the Centre, which has to spell out its position on the  offtake of power = from phase-II of the project. The Central government nominee on the Godbole=   committee, AV Gokak, is to attend deliberations  for the first time this = Wednesday.

Simultaneously, MSEB has denied that it has r= epudiated the power purchase agreement (PPA) as claimed by the DPC. MSEB ha= s also rejected DPC's claim over its failure to meet contractual obligation= s. The MSEB, after consulting the state advocate general, lawyers and the s= tate government, may serve a notice with respect to the dispute over the PT= N to the DPC, as per clause 20.2 of the PPA.  According to the provisions of clause 20.2, a dispute would be referred to = the dispute resolution panel comprising of one or two high-level representa= tives from the MSEB and the DPC. DPC had earlier served a notice with respe= ct to disputes over the payment of arrears towards the November and Decembe= r bills and interest thereon on January 25 this year. Accordingly, a disput= e  resolution. MSEB plans to dispute PTN validity panel comprising Enron In= dia managing director K Wade Cline and MSEB accounts member A Krishna Rao w= as set up. Although the panel had held a series of meetings, it failed to a= rrive at an acceptable solution. MSEB sources told The Financial Express th= at it cannot accept the PTN at this point of time, especially when the rene= gotiation process had been launched. Further, according to MSEB, it had not=  defaulted, neither had it avoided the payment of bills, but for certain di= sputes and thus, the PTN is disputed.  MSEB sources said that if the DPC rejects its claim on disputes over PTN, t= hen it was prepared to fight it out at the arbitration. ""However, it needs = to be legally studied whether, at a time, how many cases could be referred = to arbitration. In fact, DPC has already initiated arbitration by serving n= otices to the Centre on April 4 and to the Maharashtra government and the M= SEB on April 10 over the non-payment of the December 2000 and January bills= ,"" these sources added. The MSEB reiterated that the outstanding amount of = the December bill (Rs 102 crore) and the January bill (Rs 111 crore) is not=  payable. Instead, it claimed that the DPC, inter alia, is entitled to pay = Rs 401.6 crore to the MSEB towards rebate charged for ""misdeclaration and d= efault on the availability of power on January 28."" The disputes and differ= ences have cropped up with regard to this payment and the same has been ref= erred to the arbitration and the pending resolution. The MSEB said that pen= ding the said resolution as to whether the amount is ""payable"" to MSEB by  = the DPC, the latter cannot expect the payment of December and January bills=  by the MSEB.  THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Monday, 21 MAy, 2001,http://www.financialexpress.com/fe20010521/news3.html Govt, MSEB keen to probe role of IDBI in issue of Dabhol PTN,  Sanjay Jog  The Maharashtra government and the  Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MS= EB) are curious to know   the role played by the Indian rupee lenders' cons= ortium leader Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) in the issuance o= f  preliminary termination notice (PTN) by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC). = The sources in Mantralaya and MSEB told The Financial Express that if Indus= trial Development Bank of India, which has provided a guarantee of Rs 3,000=  crore to dollar loans and also lent Rs 1,780 crore for Dabhol phase-I and = II, along with offshore lenders has voted in favour of authorising DPC to i= ssue PTN to MSEB, then it  must have received blessings from the BJP-led go= vernment at the  Centre. The Centre's nod is a must as IDBI is still a stat= e-run organisation.  If Industrial Development Bank of India, which had voted against the propos= al to authorise Enron India managing director K Wade Cline for issuing PTN = at DPC's board meeting held in London on April 25, has opposed the PTN  dec= ision, then it should be questioned as according to the agreement between D= PC and its lenders,  the preliminary termination notice cannot be issued if=  a single 'secured creditor' voted against it. The sources are of the view = that if IDBI has remained consistent and opposed the decision on issuance o= f PTN, then the validity of the issuance of PTN would be questioned on the = basis of a lending agreement between various lenders and DPC. ""We are keen = to know whether IDBI has opposed this move,"" the sources said.  Further, the sources said the IDBI should have blocked the move to issue th= e PTN as the high stakes of Indian financial institutions and banks have be= en involved in the Dabhol project. However, sources of Indian Financial Ins= titutions (IFI) have contradicted the state government and MSEB and said th= at offshore lenders control the decision relating to termination of the pow= er purchase agreement (PPA) ""if they hold at least 4 per cent of the total = principal debt."" ""Overseas Private Investment Corporation, USA alone or the=  rest of Dabhol phase-I foreign banks group have such  requisite voting per= centage. In this situation, if they issue the consent to DPC for serving pr= eliminary termination notice, consent from other lenders including IFIs wou= ld not be necessary,"" sources added. The sources said that the IFIs, which = have a massive exposure of Rs 5,154 crore, have no protection of the Govern= ment of India counter guarantee. However, the Dabhol phase-I offshore lende= rs are protected under the guarantee of the Maharashtra government and the = Centre's counter guarantee.

(PTI)  THE TIMES OF INDIA Monday, 21 MAy, 2001,http://www.timesofindia.com/today/21busi6.htm Maharashtra working on ways to avoid Enron penalty=20  Maharashtra is working out a strategy to avoid paying huge damages to US po= wer major Enron if its subsidiary, the Dabhol Power Company (DPC), axes its=  power purchase agreement with the state electricity board.Chief Minister V= ilasrao Deshmukh, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Pawar and = senior                                         bureaucrats have been huddle= d in discussions with legal experts since DPC issued a pre-termination noti= ce on the  board on Saturday. ""The governments of Maharashtra and India wou= ld face  lawsuits to the tune of Rs 170 billion,"" an official said. With Ne= w Delhi providing counter guarantees for the project, it threatens to be a = liability for the entire country.  Maharashtra has already begun to cover its flanks by charging DPC with prov= iding insufficient services and installing substandard equipment to prevent=  its facility from generating 95 percent power. A penalty of Rs 4.01 billio= n was slapped on the company last month for not providing power to MSEB at = a notice of three hours. A notice for a similar penalty would be sent in Ju= ne as well, officials here said.MSEB officials have been quoted as saying t= hat no bills would be paid to the company after the April bill of Rs 1.39 b= illion. The bills for the remaining months would be adjusted against the pe= nalty. With Enron hardening its stand, it is possible the company could sto= p power supply from June, they indicated.Although the DPC has issued the pr= eliminary termination notice, the actual process of terminating the PPA cou= ld take as long as six months. ""This initiates the process of terminating t= he power purchase agreement with the Maharashtra State  Electricity Board (= MSEB),"" DPC said in a statement.Simultaneously, it said it was open to ""con= structive"" negotiations on the issue.  The DPC is demanding that the Central government participate in the negotia= tions between Enron and MSEB or provide credit support to purchasers of its=  power as a pre-condition to talks. ""While a lasting and feasible solution = to this issue may be possible, it can only occur if the parties contractual= ly bound to purchase DPC power (MSEB with guarantees from state and central=  government) are willing to either purchase themselves or find ""other"" cred= itworthy entities,"" the company said. Enron also said the report of committ= ee on renegotiating the power purchase agreement should not be the basis fo= r discussions.  The stalemate in the $3 billion project follows the Maharashtra government = disputing payments for power  purchased by the MSEB from the DPC. The gover= nment cleared its February and March outstanding of Rs 1.13 billion and Rs = 1.34 billion respectively but under protest. The DPC currently produces 740=  MW of power. This will go up to 2,184 MW when the second phase of the proj= ect goes on stream later this year.

(PTI)  THE ASIAN AGE Monday, May21, 2001, http://www.asianageonline.com/ Enr-off?  With the Dabhol Power Company issuing a pre-termination notice, it should n= ow be reasonably certain that Enron, the controversial power project, will = wind up its operations in Maharashtra. It is indeed doubtful that the influ= ential political lobby which ushered the US giant in amid great controversy=  will be able to do much this time. The series of renegotiations have faile= d, last minute attempts to humour Mr Sharad Pawar have failed and the lobby=  which had helped Enron to hype its deal has been surprisingly silent. In t= he short run, the state will have to pay a price for the withdrawal; in fac= t, Enron was hoping that precisely that will  happen and the government wil= l develop cold feet.=20  But with the Centre now washing its hands off the deal, any amount of econo= mic ""diplomacy"" and bargaining is unlikely to succeed. As the curtain comes=  down on one of India's most  controversial deals involving a multinational=  corporation, it is  time that the matter is looked at afresh. This does no= t mean that the conscious project be reviewed. What it does mean that the e= xperts who for various reasons opposed the project in the first place shoul= d be consulted by the state government. At the same time, Mr Deshmukh shoul= d ensure that those who have been votaries of the project do not become vic= tims of recrimination. Six months that have been stipulated for a last-ditc= h attempt to save a project which promised much, can have meaning only if E= nron is willing to come down from its high horse. But as reports from its p= arent country amply show, Enron is trying to woo US lawmakers in an era of = deregulation.  Energy executives of Enron spent close to 30 minutes with Mr Dick Cheney, a=  privilege which essentially exemplifies the importance of being Enron. But=  this importance should not be overstretched, and a large section in the In= dian power establishment thinks so. Enron wields no magic wand, but its lea= ding status as a power-sector giant is not to be doubted. Be that as it may= , its Indian experience has been a far from happy one. Political opportunis= m may have queered the Indian picture, but it's primarily the Enron strateg= y to first target and then control markets. Its ""insurgent"" strategy someti= mes works. At other times, it does not. In the Indian experience, it has no= t quite worked. The story that the friends of Enron had deliberately circul= ated- that other MNCs will think twice before investing in India if Enron f= ails, have been proved unfounded. Enron may have registered phenomenal grow= th over the years, but that by itself was never any guarantee that its Indi= an bid would too, especially with conflicting political positions dogging i= ts high  cost per unit power.  The end of Enron is by no means the end of the world. A few comparable exam= ples would empirically sustain the fact that it is not impossible to live w= ithout Enron, whatever its high-profile supporters would suggest. The Mahar= ashtra government needs Central and overall support in facing the crisis it=  is in, though the support may merely be a moral one. The late Rangarajan K= umaramangalam used to bemoan the  absence of a realistic and long-term poli= cy for the power sector.The unhappy Enron example should make the Central a= nd state governments to thrash out a cohesive, constructive policy. At the = peak of summers, the absence of a genuine policy further complicates infras= tructural and other constraints. That is such an elementary fact anyway.

2022-04-20 01:48:59+00:00,false,6,"  For those of you that do not know, we are planning greg's bachelor party for the weekend of May 19th.  We've rented a beach house in Surfside.  The beach house is front row on the portion of the beach that allows open fires and automobiles on the beach...both very cool things.  We have the house Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday. Jeff, Greg, and I will probably arrive Friday night, however the main shindig will get kicked off on Saturday night.  I don't exactly know what the main shindig is, but we realize that most people won't be able to pull themselves away from their miserable lives for an entire weekend.  Jeff, Greg, and I however, will make sure that the keg is working properly friday evening.  So what I need from you is a confirmation that you will: A - Be there Friday and Saturday B - Be there Sometime Saturday, Leave sometime Saturday C - Be there Saturday, Leave Sunday D - Can't make it.  Dallas is too far from Surfside.  Cost will be $625 for the house for the entire weekend.  So depending on how many people we get the price should be between $60-$100 per person.  Each person will be responsible for their own food, and a sleeping bag/pillow, etc.  No linens are provided, (I'm assuming this means no towels either) but I think they have a grill so that's the important thing.  Greg will confirm.  Cards, Dominoes', booze, beach shit, etc.  are other good items to bring.  We will send specific directions at a later time.  Let me know your status so we can get a better handle on costs.  I will pass on more info (costs/directions) as we get it.  Later.  jk   __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Yahoo!

A lot depends on the Government's (MSEB, State & Central) willingness to find a solution that is acceptable to us and helps in project completion.  We are scheduled to meet the Renegotiating Committee on May 23 for the second time.  And, we have to see what do the Lenders decide - whether they resume funding (and, if so, under what conditions).  Let us hope for the best.  In the present circumstances, it may not be advisable to have the OLNG team visiting site.  With regards to the meeting in Houston, do you have an idea about what they want to discuss?  We could then decide about the meeting after talking to Clay & Neil.

I'm still hoping for a positive outcome from the current dialogues. However, I've been reading the Indian press and they are rather depressing. I hope that you are not overworked and overstressed.  Oman LNG wants to have a meeting in Houston in early June. They are also still asking about the possibility of a site visit at DPC. I want to talk to Clay Harris and get his view on the desirability of such meetings. How do you feel about meeting with DPC's principal LNG supplier. I would not know what to tell them at this point. A site visit would be awkward at this time.   Also, Oman LNG has requested a DPC logo in electronic file form. Can you provide it to me?  When would be a good time for me to call on Thursday?

Wolkoff, Executive Vice President  RE: Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")  DATE: May 7, 2001 =========================================================== Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001, new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") will go into effect.  !    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members.  !    The term ""executing broker"" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.  !    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.  !    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example, prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (b)  the account number; (c)  the brokerage rate; (d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and (e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account. Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.   If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212) 299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,  NEW RULE 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")  (Entire rule is new.)  Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades  In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members, the following rules shall define the respective responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The ""executing broker"", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.  (A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members  (1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice shall be retained by the Clearing Member.  (2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if: (1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.  (3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system. Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing Member, customer and the executing broker.  (B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers  (1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:  (a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer; (b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms; (c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as practicable; and (d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.  2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these rules.  3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (g)  the account number; (h)  the brokerage rate; (i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and (j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account. The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.  4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing Member(s) of any such rejection.           Carr Futures 150 S.

The firm feels that the PPA cannot be scrapped without the cons= ent of the lenders, who are also stakeholders in the project by virtue of t= heir debt exposure.=20  Armed with the opinion of DPC's law firm including the Indian Law Institute=  and the advice of White & Case, the lenders are meeting in Singapore in th= e first week of June to chalk out  the next course of action. At the meetin= g, lenders across the board areexpected to oppose the MSEB move as they fee= l that the failure of the 657 mw phase I project in generating power in tim= e (cold start in 3 hours) is a breach of warranty which can be settled thro= ugh arbitration.It cannot be a valid ground for the termination of the PPA.=  The MSEB had issued the notice toscrap the PPA on May 23, a week after DPC=  served the preliminary termination notice to the board. DPC served the PTN=  after the foreign lenders gave their consent despite a stiff opposition pu= t up by the Indian lenders. However, the lenders did not give DPC the conse= nt for transfer of assets. The company, has, however appointed Arthur Ander= sen and Jones Lang La Salle to undertake a valuation exercise of the projec= t.=20  The MSEB move on scrapping the PPA has unified the entire lending community=  which was  vertically divided on DPC's action on serving the  PTN. While t= he Indian lenders-who are not covered by the Centre's counter guarantee-opp= ose the PTN tooth and nail, the foreign lenders gave the go-ahead to the co= mpany as they were apprehensive that the MSEB might pull the plug ahead of = DPC. Now both the Indian as well as the foreign lenders are planning to opp= ose the scrapping of  PPA collectively. The Singapore meeting will take sto= ck of the cash position of Phase II of the project which is set to go on tr= ial run on June 7 and formalise the lenders stance whether to support or mo= thball the project.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Monday, May 28, 2001 Centre not 'very keen' to resolve Enron embroglio: Deshmukh =20 MAHARASHTRA chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on Monday accused the BJP-led = NDA government at the centre of 'not being very keen to resolve the ongoing=  embroglio' between state electricity board and Enron-promoted Dabhol Power=  Company. ""The centre is not cooperating with the state government over thi= s issue,"" Deshmukh told reporters after the ruling Democratic Front coordin= ation committee meeting here. Despite several letters, the centre has not r= esponded to the state's pleas to intervene in the matter, the chief  minist= er said and lamented that the centre was not taking  the issue with utmost = priority. The DF constituents were briefed about the legal steps initiated = by the state government vis-a-vis DPC, Deshmukh said. The renegotiations co= mmittee appointed by the state government is slated to meet on May 29, the = day on which the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission was also to = take up the petition filed by MSEB against DPC. The DF's future strategy in=  this matter will be decided on May 31 in view of the outcome of the MERC a= nd renegotiations panel meeting, Deshmukh added. (PTI) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Monday, May 28, 2001  'Centre not to purchase power from DPC',  Sanjay Jog  THE union minister of state for power Jayavantiben Mehta has categorically = stated that the Centre would not purchase the Dabhol power, but would allow=  the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) to sell its power directly to various other=  states across the country. ""However, the DPC will have to drastically cut = the tariff. The Centre is prepared to facilitate the direct sale of power b= y DPC to states which are power deficit,"" Ms Mehta said in an exclusive int= erview. Ms Mehta's statement comes in the wake of the DPC's appeal on Frida= y to the Centre to help resolve the ongoing crisis.  The minister said that although the Centre would not purchase Dabhol power,=  it would provide necessary assistance to resolve the present impasse. ""The=  Centre will try to protect the interests of the Maharashtra state and ulti= mately of the National Democratic Alliance government in a bid to find a wa= y out to overcome the Dabhol crisis,"" she opined. Ms Mehta said that she wa= s of the view that efforts should be made to save the Dabhol project especi= ally when there were several states which had been striving to meet increas= ing demand for power. She said it is important to meet the demand for power=  as the country is entering into newer and newer pastures in various segmen= ts like information technology, software development and oil  and petroleum=  through joint ventures.  ""Similarly, the Indian financial institutions (IF= Is) have appealed to the Centre that it should take a positive view as thei= r substantial funds are blocked in the Dabhol project,"" she added.  The minister also said that there has been tremendous pressure from the IFI= s to get the project  going. The IFIs have already made representations to = the Centre on various occasions in this regard. According to Ms mehta, the = DPC has said that it has three options comprising termination of contract, = participate in the negotiations and the take over of Dabhol project by any = agency. ""I am quite optimistic that ultimately an acceptable solution will = emerge,"" she observed.Ms Mehta said that the people should consider the Dab= hol crisis against the backdrop of country's  requirement of additional one=  lakh mega watt to be created by 2012. ""The NDA government is committed for=  this capacity addition despite a huge required investment of Rs 8 lakh cro= re,"" she remarked.  Ms Mehta said that the NDA government in general and her ministry in partic= ular have taken a lot of  initiatives to make this a reality with the activ= e participation of the private sector. The ministry has  launched a 100 per=  cent metering programme, improvement and strengthening of transmission and=   distribution, encouragement for the privatisation of power distribution s= ystems and implementation of  power development programme across the countr= y, she added.Meanwhile, the Dabhol Power Company is believed to have projec= ted that the per unit tariff would  be reduced at Rs 4.20. The per unit tar= iff will further be reduced at Rs 3.50, when the naphtha would be replaced = by liquified natural gas (LNG). DPC has already announced that the block b = of  722 of phase-II would start commercial operations from June 7. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Monday, May 28, 2001 The great Indian investment movie Ecopinion/ S L RAO=20  THE Dabhol-Enron saga has all the ingredients for an unusual Hindi movie. T= here is a principal female interest in the (to some) ravishing and (to all)=  extraordinarily shrewd, determined and tough negotiator, Rebecca Mark. If = politicians in India are our sleazy side, we have them from many political = parties at all stages in the unfolding drama. For the comic element we have=  the bumbling, stuttering, uncertain, and incompetent Maharashtra State Ele= ctricity Board, always trying hard to please its masters, without any regar= d to its self-interest. For the patsy, the fall guy, we have the electricit= y customers of Maharashtra, paying increasing amounts forpoor quality. Then=  there are the other bit and not-so-bit players - the academics, the NGOs, = the negotiating and re-negotiating groups, with varying interests, motivati= ons and influences.=20  But the hero(ine) of the story is undoubtedly Rebecca Mark, who rammed thro= ugh an agreement that was  opposed by very many and `educated' some of the = shrewdest political leaders in India.  Her Texan bulldozing ability, never-= give-up attitude, total focus on her objective, packaged in an attractive f= emale form, were too much for all her interlocutors, who were elderly men w= ith no experience of such opponents, and even less so with strong women.=20  Looming above all these characters is the brooding and baleful presence of = the government of India. What little has emerged from Abhay Mehta and the G= odbole Report shows its intervention at critical times to ease the way for = the clearance and signing of the agreement. Apparently there was little con= cern for what the record would show, as indeed it has since done, that the = approval of its technical wing (the central electricity authority), was rde= red, and the clear recommendation of the World Bank, usually a strong suppo= rter of foreign private investment, ignored. Among the government agencies = involved, except perhaps the CEA, there was an urgent and overwhelming desi= re to clear the project.=20  At the same time, the central government had done little of its policy home= work. It had not defined a clear fuel policy for the country. It could ther= efore easily sanction naphtha and imported gas based power generation proje= cts, with consequent cost escalation when the then (temporary) glut became = a shortage. It refused to accept that the external value of the rupee would=  keep declining, even though it had just depreciated the rupee by a whoppin= g 20 per cent. It had little understanding of the movements of internationa= l prices of oil and gas and assumed that present prices would be the  norm.=  These factors led to substantial escalations in costs and of tariffs. With= out any firm plan to use the surplus gas transport and processing capacitie= s, it agreed to MSEB paying the full fixed charges for gas capacities far i= n excess of the needs of the power plant.=20  In this movie, therefore, the central government would be cast as the wicke= d uncle lurking behind the scenes and orchestrating the looting of the fall=  guy. This movie can have no happy ending. Indeed, one wonders if it can ha= ve an ending at all. The hero(ine) has  left the scene, as have her courtie= rs. Her kingdom, Enron, no longer has an interest in the movie and would li= ke to give it up. The bumbling MSEB and its owner, the Maharashtra governme= nt, have no clue as to what to do. The politicians are in a corner, wringin= g their hands, helpless to extricate the country from the mess, but intent = on saving themselves and their positions. The central government would like=  to forget the whole sorry episode, but cannot. The country stands to lose = vast sums of money as fines and compensation payments, and a considerable l= oss of image, for not adhering to agreements.=20  It also stands exposed for incompetence, a sorry advertisement for a countr= y with the brains to become an IT `superpower'. Between the two, the exposu= re of incompetence allied to possible venality, is more  damaging. Our gove= rnments must stop playing to the grandstand. They must understand that they=  are playing in an international, not an Indian theatre. Their opponents, E= nron, have all the cards stacked in their favour. Time is not on our side. = We must end the movie. That requires that we use our best talents to buy En= ron out. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- BUSINESS STANDARD, Monday, May 28, 2001 In Guhagarh, the majority couldn't care less, S Ravindran in Guhagarh  Nature is at its best along the 50-kilometre stretch connecting Chiplun, th= e cultural capital of Konkan, to Guhagarh which houses the controversial Da= bhol Power Project.Mountains dotted with Alphonso mango trees and the lashi= ng Arabian sea make the place an  ideal picnic spot. However, along the wel= l-laid out road leading to Guhagarh, odd huts and barren land reveal the   = sad economic plight of the region Hopes of the $3-billion power project put= ting an end to the poverty-ridden life of the people living here seem to be=  short lived now.=20  Locals today say if Enron was to exit from the controversial power project,=  there would be only  a marginal effect on the region's economy. A few will=  suffer if the power major chooses to pack its bags. The majority could not=  care less. Appasaheb Salagre, called Appa by all and a long-time resident = of Chiplun running tutorial classes, says, ""Initially, there was a spurt in=  the economy. A number of people found employment in the project. However, = the bulk of  the 12,000 -odd contract workers were from Bihar, UP, Bijapur = (Karnataka) and other  regions."" The locals are not an educated lot here, s= ays Appa. They could get only low-paid jobs. These  jobs too were temporary=  in nature. ""Contract labourers would have lost their jobs once constructio= n of the project was over. This isirrespective of whether Enron decides to = stay on  or exit,"" he adds.=20  Concurs Pramod Pednekar, a local journalist with Pudhari, a large-selling M= arathi daily, ""A large number of Enron-officials in Chiplun gave a fillip t= o the travel business benefiting several  lodges and hotels. Now that the c= ompany has its own township, these opportunities too have vanished. However= , a number of people used to come to do their marketing in Chiplun which wi= ll now be affected. With very few people from Guhagarh employed at the plan= t, Enron's exit will hit the region's economy by not more than five per cen= t."" Appa adds that a number of locals in Chiplun and Guhagarh had purchased=  Sumos to carry Enron executives to and fro. These people are yet to repay = their loans and hence would be affected.

The group of NRIs, under the umbrella 'Enron Action', in th= eir outcry put up on the website  (www.altindia.net/enron) have stated that=  under international law, the MSEB can bypass the 'insane' obligations to t= he DPC only if an Indian court rules that the power purchase agreement (PPA= ) and the agreements surrounding it were in violation of Indian law.=20  A court case was filed by Prayas, an NGO, but has been rejected by the Bomb= ay High Court.  An appeal against this dismissal is pending before the Supr= eme Court, the group says. The NRIs group stated that under the laws when t= he PPA was signed, the agreement required mandatory economic and technical = clearance from a statutory body (the Central Electricity Authority), which = has been constituted for this purpose. The CEA issued a technical clearance=  to the DPC power plant, it refused the economic clearance. Rather it was t= he ministry of finance that looked into and approved the economic  issues. = The petitioners are falling back on the argument that the ""mandatory CEA cl= earance was the legal  safeguard against signing PPAs at exorbitant rates.= =20  As this clearance was never received, they conclude the Dabhol PPA has no f= orce in law"".  The World Bank also categorically stated in its feasibility = report in 1993, when it was asked to part fund the project, that it was ""no= t economically viable, and thus could not be  financed by the Bank"". It wen= t on to say that it ""would place a heavy financial burden on the MSEB"" beca= use it was  ""too large for base load operation in the MSEB system"".

MSEB is=  prepared to engage lawyers at a fee of paltry Rs 15,000 per hour to a whop= ping Rs 1.50 lakh. In terms of pounds, it has prepared to shell out a minim= um of 90 pounds per hour to 500 pounds per hour.MSEB sources told The Finan= cial Express that according to preliminary estimates, it expects the legal = expenses in the range of Rs 1 crore to Rs 5 crore. ""We will spend it as we = have a strong case against the DPC for misdeclaration and default on the av= ailability of power on January 28 and non payment of rebate of Rs 401 crore=  towards that,"" sources added.  The lawyer's fees would be dependent on their experience. The more the expe= rience and the name, the higher would be the fees. ""For example, if a lawye= r, other than Indian origin, has completed one year in the profession, his/= her fees would start from 90 pounds per hour. However, the lawyer represent= ing a leading firm with a vast experience, he/she would charge not less tha= n 450 to 500 pounds per hour,"" MSEB sources said.In a recent communication = to the MSEB, the London-based Baker & McKenzie has said the ""rate of charge= s of around 360 pounds per hour are highly competitive compared to other fi= rms of similar status and experience.""

These rates would apply to firms such as Linklaters (representing Enron) an= d the other top firms that  would have the necessary experience to respond = in kind to Linlaters, the Baker & McKenzie  communication said. MSEB source= s said that it was aware that it would have to take on a battery of lawyers=  and solicitors both from India and abroad engaged by the DPC. Further, it = was also aware of the fact that the US-based multinational Enron, with deep=  pockets, would not mind fighting its case in  various Indian courts and la= ter at arbitration in London.  MSEB said that it would engage the state advocate general Ghulam Wahanvati = during the hearing at  Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (Merc)= . In addition, it has already engaged Mumbai-based solicitors Shyam Diwan &=  Company to provide legal assistance. MSEB would also try to rope in the be= st available solicitors across the country to plead its case in the Indian = courts. Simultaneously, it would have to pay the fees of its arbitrator and=  former Bombay High Court Justice ML Pendse during the arbitration proceedi= ngs in London.MSEB sources said that it was aware that billing rates are on= ly one part of the equation that leads to  the ultimate bill that a law fir= m sends to its clients.

Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay got it.  Mr Lay used the time=  to set out an eight-point agenda intended, among other things, to head off=  price controls on wholesale electricity, provide Enron and other energy tr= aders with unfettered access to the US's electricity- transmission system a= nd remove regulatory obstacles to building new generating plants and power = lines. The energy plan President George W Bush unveiled last week re-electe= d many of those same priorities. In a recent interview, the vice president = said he also met with other energy executives, but Mr Lay was the only one = he named. Mr Cheney says he sought Mr Lay's advice because ""Enron has a dif= ferent take than most energy companies.""=20  Indeed, Enron is a modern paradox. It has transformed itself over the past = 15 years from a stodgy gas-pipeline operator into the largest trader of gas=  and electricity in the US and a formidable player in newer markets such as=  telecommunications services and emissions-reduction credits. Today, it is = the quintessential model of a company dedicated to free markets.=20  In a certain respect, this is true even in Enron's dealings in India, where=  the company is in the news this week because of a dispute with a state ele= ctricity board over that entity's failure to pay $48 million in overdue bil= ls. Enron was one of the first foreign power companies to enter India when = the country started free-market reforms in the early 1990s, and Dabhol Powe= r Corp., its power-generating project outside Bombay, remains India's singl= e largest foreign investment. Enron's trouble has its roots in the sometime= s wildly shifting political winds in India; it is facing political barbs fr= om opponents who attack it as a foreign multinational unjustly milking a po= or country by charging too much for electricity, a charge Dabhol denies.=20  Politics, however, is a minefield that Enron has very successfully negotiat= ed in the US. As much as any  American company, it has cultivated close tie= s with government. Since the late 1980s, the Houston-based  company, which = was President Bush's biggest corporate campaign donor, has beefed up its lo= bbying staff,  boosted its political contributions and sought out friends i= n the world of politics. Now, with Mr Bush in the White House, it is in a u= nique position to see whether those efforts will pay off.=20  Enron's lobbying blitz reflects one of the ironies of the era of deregulati= on. Just as government created  immense telephone, electric and gas monopol= ies early in the 20th century, Enron and other players feel they need the g= overnment's help in opening those monopolies and gaining access to once-clo= sed markets. In particular, Enron wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commi= ssion to ensure that energy is deregulated on terms favourable to the compa= ny. Rather than having the nation's transmission lines controlled by the ut= ilities,  it wants-those lines to provide open access for new entrants such=  as Enron eager to buy and sell power.=20  Mr Lay is on a first-name basis with a half-dozen members of the Bush cabin= et and knows many senior White House staffers from their days in the Texas = governor's mansion with Mr Bush. Before joining the administration, both Wh= ite House economist Lawrence Lindsey and US Trade Representative Robert Zoe= llick were on Enron's advisory board, which pays members an annual stipend = of $50,000.  Under Mr Lay, Enron has donated nearly $2 million to Mr Bush d= uring his political career. Since the start of the 2000 campaign, Enron and=  its employees have contributed $1.3 million to the Bush presidential drive= , the  Republican Party and the presidential inauguration, says the Center = for Responsive Politics. Enron also  accounted for $461,000 in contribution= s during Mr Bush's two runs for governor, according to the Center for Publi= c Integrity.  Mr Lay, who holds a doctorate in economics, says all he wants from governme= nt is a fair shake. Enron  supports candidates ""you believe in,"" he says. ""= You believe in their value system, you believe in their  philosophy and you=  believe they'll do the right things as leaders.""  But it is clear that Mr = Lay wants more than that from government. For now, he is focusing on FERC, = where he worked in the early 1970s when the agency was known as the Federal=  Power Commission. He hopes to make FERC his ally in beating back the power=  of utilities. Long dismissed as a regulatory backwater overseeing wholesal= e transactions by electric and gas utilities the commission has emerged as = the chief navigator of the nation's transition to a fully deregulated energ= y marketplace.=20  Even before Mr Bush took office, FERC had begun to rein in the market power=  of utilities. In December, it told the nation's utilities that it wanted t= hem to voluntarily surrender their high-voltage lines-those that can dispat= ch electricity across state lines-to independent grid operators, such as th= ose already in place in  California and the Northeast United States, which = would provide open access to the lines. Although it told the utilities to s= ubmit plans for doing so, many of them have been reluctant to relinquish co= ntrol of their lines to such independent organisations.=20  Mr Lay wants FERC to go further, forcing the utilities to cede direct contr= ol of their lines. He also is seeking rules that would end what he calls en= ergy ""Balkanisation"" and create ""seamless"" interstate electricity markets. = ""Enron is the biggest gas and electric company entirely dependent on the co= mpetitive side of the business,"" says Andre Meade, an analyst for Commerzba= nk. ""To the extent deregulation slows down, their business slows down.""  Ri= ght now, it's a lucrative strategy. Enron typically targets tightly control= led markets just as they are opening up, using its financial clout and risk= -management acumen to gain a dominant market position. In doing so, it freq= uently portrays itself as an insurgent taking on entrenched interests.=20  In electricity, for instance, Enron buys the output of generating plants, s= ometimes days, weeks or years before the power is actually produced. Using = sophisticated weather data, it determines the most lucrative market for the=  power, finds a buyer, and then arranges delivery via transmission lines ow= ned by others. It hedges its positions with other contracts. Its wholesale = trading volume climbed 55% for natural gas and more than doubled for electr= icity in the first quarter alone.=20  Between 1996 and 2000, Enron's yearly net income nearly doubled to $979 mil= lion and its revenue increased almost eightfold to $100.8 billion. Over the=  same period, Enron's stock price, adjusted for splits, rose more than four= fold. At the start of the Bush administration FERC's future was very much u= p for grabs. Two of the five seats on the commission were vacant, and Enron=  quickly sought to fill them with activist Republicans. President Bush name= d a friend of his and Enron's to one of those seats: Texas utility-regulato= r Pat Wood. Mr Wood had worked closely with Enron during a six-year effort = to open Texas' retail electricity market. Mr Wood also had shown the kind o= f backbone Enron wanted in a separate fight over telephone deregulation whe= n he insisted on closely monitoring phone utilities to make sure they opene= d their networks to competitors.=20  For the second slot, Enron backed Nora Mead Brownell, a Pennsylvania utilit= y regulator. She had come to Enron's aid in 1997 when she voted to block a = electricity-market restructuring plan backed by Philadelphia's utility and = by Republican Gov. Tom Ridge. Enron argued that the plan would have locked = it out of the Philadelphia market.A White House spokeswoman says a number o= f individuals and industry groups weighed in to favour Ms Brownell, but she=  declined to name any. Meanwhile, Enron was using its Democratic contacts t= o strengthen its ties with Linda Breathitt, a Kentucky Democrat on the comm= ission. Earlier this year, the company hired two of former Vice President A= l Gore's closest friends as lobbyists: Nashville lawyer Charles Bones and M= r Gore's campaign-finance director, Johnny Hayes. Both had come to know Ms = Breathitt through Democratic politics.Ms Breathitt says she wasn't very fam= iliar with Enron's interests, but that she accepted when Mr Hayes invited h= er to dinner at a Washington restaurant in April to meet Richard Shapiro, E= nron's managing director for government affairs. ""Everyone likes to get to = now the FERC commissioners,"" Ms Breathitt says, adding that she always pays=  for her own meals.  Enron has long played this kind of insider's game. Mr Lay has been friendly=  with both Democratic and  Republican administrations over the past 25 year= s, sharing time on the golf course with Presidents Bill  Clinton and Gerald=  Ford. He's been a particularly close friend of the Bush family. In the lat= e l980s, he ran  fund-raising drives in Texas for the current US president'= s father, then-Vice President George Bush. After the younger Bush became go= vernor, he appointed Mr Lay to run the influential Governor's Business Coun= cil. Mr Lay also made Enron's fleet of corporate jets available to the new = governor and won his help in lobbying officials considering Enron projects.= =20  Mr Lay says he hasn't sought Mr Bush's aid directly since Mr Bush won the p= residency. ""It's not a matter of us going off hunting or fishing or sitting=  around and having drinks,"" he says.  Not all Mr Lay's initiatives have bee= n successful. When Mr Bush reneged in March on a campaign pledge to fight g= lobal warming by requiring reductions in carbon-dioxide levels produced by = burning hydrocarbons, Mr Lay says he telephoned Mr Cheney to complain. ""The=  scientific evidence, although certainly not conclusive, is  pretty compell= ing that there could be a climate-change problem,"" he says he told the vice=  president. ""The  administration should still look very seriously at it.""  But Enron saved its main lobbying push for Mr Cheney's energy task force. I= n April, Mr Lay met with the panel's staff director, Andrew Lundquist, and = later, with Mr Cheney. In both meetings, say Enron and White House official= s, Mr Lay presented a broad agenda for opening up the nation's electrical s= ystem and wed the gas-transmission system as a point of comparison. In both=  cases, he argues, pipelines and transmission lines should be like the fede= ral highway system that offers easy access to all. The Cheney report uses s= imilar language, describing the electrical grid as the highway for intersta= te  commerce in electricity."" As Enron sought, the report directs the energ= y secretary to determine by the end of the year whether it makes sense to e= stablish a national grid, and to identify bottlenecks in the transmission s= ystem as well as how to remove them.

This assumes significance=  because in case the plant fails to deliver full capacity according to the = power purchase agreement, the board will have the right to declare the plan= t unviable. Enron has already defaulted thrice and the board has slapped Rs=  768 crore as penalty, which is a matter in dispute.Confirming this plan, a=  top official in MSEB said, ``Once they declare commercial production, we w= ill undertake a capacity test by asking them to shut down the plant complet= ely for atleast 2 days and then perform a cold start. If they do not achiev= e full rated capacity (657 MW) within three hours then we will declare the = plant as inefficient.''  MSEB has already formed a core team comprising six technical officers to wo= rk on block 1 of Phase II expansion project. As per the agreement the compa= ny is scheduled to start commercial production on June 7 and should furnish=  a seven-day notice to the board to gear up to the capacity addition. Sourc= es added that while commissioning a block, there are provisions in the powe= r purchase agreements to do a performance test for both the parties, viz MS= EB and DPC. Unlike periodic reviews of the plant, this test would be crucia= l since an official added that once the plant does not qualify in the initi= al capacity check, then the board could declare the plant as unviable.  Energy experts informed that under section 5.3 of the PPA, immediately afte= r commercial production, there will be a technical capacity check where all=  parameters of the plant will be put to test. Here since the company has be= en charged of misdeclaration and that the plant failed to deliver power wit= hin 180 minutes from a cold start, this test will be quite crucial. Sources=  added that the cold start timing will be amended only after the project is=  shifted to liquefied natural gas, when instead of 180 minutes, the plant w= ould get 240  minutes to achieve full rated capacity. But this will not be = applicable to Block 1 of Phase II since the project will be run by naphtha.  ``It's just impossible to achieve full rated capacity in 3 hours after a co= ld start especially after a long period of idle time. The plant took five a= nd a half hours to achieve its full capacity on January 28, where the plant=  was instructed to stop operations for 6 days,'' said an MSEB official. Sou= rces added that the ramp up curves                                        i= ncorporated in the PPA is a technical goof-up since  ramp up time depends o= n how long the plant was kept idle.MSEB officials informed that there was n= o notice given by the company yet on the June 7 deadline. They added that t= he company has to furnish a seven-day notice to the board before declaring = commercial production.                                      =20   Interestingly, the turbines used for Phase II project are not sourced from=  General Electric but from Japanese companies. However, experts argue that = 3 hours ramp up time for any cold start would still prove an uphill task fo= r the company. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE INDIAN EXPRESS, Monday, May 28, 2001 DPC may challenge MERC's jurisdiction  Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) is likely to challenge the jurisd= iction of state electricity regulatory Commission (MERC) to settle a pletho= ra of disputes, including ""rescinding"" of the PPA with Maharashtra State El= ectricity Board (MSEB) during the first hearing of the case, scheduled for = May 29.""One cannot deny the possibility of DPC's legal intention as the mul= tinational strongly believes that the PPA of its $3 billion project, does n= ot come under MERC's perview at all,"" legal officials involved in the DPC-M= SEB row told PTI here today. However, MSEB's legal counsels feel DPC would = be unable to prove their point if it took the ""jurisdiction"" angle.  MERC is a specialised body set up by Parliament in 1998 as part of the powe= r sector reforms to regulate PPAs and procurement processes of transmission=  and distribution utilities. ""This includes the regulation of the price or = tariff at which power shall be procured,"" they contend. As per section 22 (= 2)(N) of the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act of 1998, the state regul= ator has been conferred powers to ""adjudicate upon disputes and differences=  between licensees and ultities and refer the matter for arbitration."" On M= ay 25, MSEB had moved merc challenging the agreement's legal validity and s= eeking cancellation of the PPA and claiming nearly Rs 700 crore as damages = from DPC.  Terming the move as a ""logical step"", a state official said MSEB had sought=  Justice from MERC as it had exclusive legislative jurisdiction to adjudica= te disputes between two power utilities. With such an emphatic regulation, = on what grounds would DPC insist that its PPA with MSEB did not come under = MERC, the counsels said. ""After all, DPC and Maharastra State Electricity B= oard are both power utilities and the only dispute redressal forum availabl= e is the regulator,"" they said.  Interestingly, counsels are of the view that if DPC does not attend the hea= ring or refuses to comply by the regulator's notice, then MSEB would have t= o prove its ""service of summons"" upon which the Commission is entitled to g= ive an ex-parte hearing on the matter. The 60 page petition, with nearly th= ousand pages of annexures, prays that MERC should adjudicate MSEB's dispute= s with DPC, including the Rs 401 crore rebate payable by the us multination= al and mainly misrepresentation of facts involving the ramp-up procedure fr= om a cold start to full capacity.  The loss-making board has also referred numerous notices, the ""political fo= rce majeure"", the preliminary termination notice, DPC's demand for the escr= ow cover and its subsequent defaults in ramping up generation as per demand= . Maharastra State Electricity Board has also sought the regulator's direct= ion over whether it should take up international arbitration, process for w= hich is on, with DPC in London.""With a suitable order, MERC will now tell u= s how to deal with the arbitration, escrow cover, damages etc,"" an Maharast= ra State Electricity Board official said. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE TIMES OF INDIA, Monday, May 28, 2001 Defusing Dabhol=20  In the present brouhaha over the Dabhol power project, it's all too easy to=  lose sight of one fact: there is life  beyond Enron. And the eventual deno= uement will have implications far beyond this particular project. At stake = is India's image as a credible investment destination. Little is gained by = winning a war if you then end up losing the peace. It's important to rememb= er that, because positions on both sides seem to be hardening. The Madhav G= odbole Committee has criticised the power purchase agreement in no uncertai= n terms. The demand and realisation projections on which the deal was based=  have been described as a ``fairy-tale''. Two committee members have called=  for a judicial enquiry into the entire issue, to determine whether Enron r= eceived any ""undue favours"". But three members disagree, at least partly be= cause judicial inquiries in India take forever and rarely achieve anything.=  Enron, in turn, has flatly told the Centre  that it is unwilling to negoti= ate on the basis of the Godbole  Committee's report. Meanwhile, the Maharas= htra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has slapped a termination notice of its=  own on Enron's subsidiary, the Dabhol Power Company (DPC), and is demandin= g compensation of over Rs 800 crore. The MSEB contends that DPC failed to s= upply power at short notice and wrongfully withheld rebate payments. DPC cl= aims that the MSEB is wilfully misinterpreting the power purchase agreement= . Clearly, both sides are now engaged in trying to stare the other guy down= . In earlier instances, it was a safe bet that Enron would blink first. But=  if the signals emanating from the company's headquarters in Houston are an= y indication, that can't be taken for granted this time.  Let's assume the worst-case scenario - that the talks do fail. What message=  would that send out to the international community? India could, of course= , argue that the deal was flawed, but that would be tantamount to acknowled= ging that the negotiators who clinched the power purchase agreement were ei= ther criminally incompetent, or venal, or both. The fact that the deal was = signed by a different administration after the previous agreement was scrap= ped would only weaken India's position, as would the dismal fate that has b= efallen virtually every high-profile foreign investment in the power sector= . There would be a real danger of India ending up with egg on its face, apa= rt from having to pay hefty fines. Of course, it may not come to that - in = fact, let's hope it doesn't. Talks are still on, and the ideal situation wo= uld be for all parties concerned to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement= . Failing that, India should seek an out-of-court settlement which would at=  least leave it with the fig-leaf of being a country which respects  contra= ctual obligations. It should then finally start acting on all the brave tal= k of sweeping power sector reforms, which would hopefully prove that we sti= ll mean business. Does that mean that the people responsible for this frigh= tful mess should be allowed to just walk away? Of course not. There are man= y lessons to be learnt from the Enron fiasco, including the importance of a= ccountability and transparency at every step of liberalisation. But the fir= st priority has to be to put out the fire and contain the damage. Investiga= ting the arsonists can wait till later. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Monday, May 28, 2001 Dabhol project: Politics of power , S. Padmanabhan=20  IT ALWAYS looked as if the Maharashtra Government had a definite plan while=  renegotiating with Dabhol Power Company (read Enron). The plan perhaps was=  to get some cosmetic changes in tariff and give DPC large benefits such as=  sales tax exemption for naphtha; reduction in interest rates of loans; and=  third party sales in the hope of getting the Centre to make NTPC and a few=  other Central utilities buy the costly power. This would look as if the co= ntract has been renegotiated to ease the burden on Maharashtra when in fact=  the burden would have been distributed among several States and the Centre= . The ultimate beneficiary would be Enron which would continue to keep a co= ntract executed so blatantly against public interest. The  real objective o= f the Maharashtra Government and perhaps the Centre is to give  the controv= ersy a decent burial. The party was spoilt by a statement by the Nationalis= t Congress Party President, Mr Sharad Pawar, criticising the re-negotiating=  Committee Chairman, Mr Madhav Godbole. The latter resigned, but was convin= ced to retract it. But it cannot be forgotten that it was Mr Pawar as Chief=  Minister of Maharashtra, who had bypassed a lot of objections to give the = project to Enron.=20  Now it has become convenient for the Maharashtra Government to say that the=  State is suffering because of the decisions of the BJP-Shiv Sena Governmen= t. While the role of the BJP-Shiv Sena Government in reopening and permitti= ng Phase  II and integration of the LNG terminal, by which means Enron can = recover the  capital costs many times over, is utterly deplorable, it can n= ot be lost sight of that it was Mr Pawar's government that brought in Enron= . As Mr Praful Patel rightly said in STAR News' Newshour, the project had t= he blessings also of the then Prime Minister, Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, and h= is Finance Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh. All of them, pushing for reforms, w= anted a project in double-quick time and they ignored the several layers of=  approval process. The real story is described in a civil suit filed in 199= 5 by the then BJP-Shiv Sena Government in the Bombay High Court. It is anot= her matter that this civil suit was mysteriously withdrawn after the Enron = head, Ms Rebecca Mark, met the powers that be in Maharashtra, including the=  Shiv Sena chief.=20  The suit -- drafted by such eminent lawyers as, Prashant Bhushan, Nitin Pra= dhan, C. J. Sawant, the then Advocate General, and F. S. Nariman -- tells t= he interesting story of how the Pawar government went out of its way to fav= our Enron by giving approvals even after the elections were announced andco= nducted in the State -- a gross violation of the election code. To this day= , neither the Congress nor the BJP-Shiv Sena nor the NCP governments has ha= d the courage to speak the truth -- perhaps because all of them were benefi= ciaries. Here are a few passages from the suit to judge the actions of the = Pawar government:=20  A After the calling of elections for the Maharashtra State Assembly, after = expiry of its full term, the following documents came to be executed namely=  (i) Amendment to PPA dated 2/2/1995, (ii) Consent Agreement dated 23/24.2.= 1995, and (iii) Fuel Management Agreement dated 25.2.1995. As mentioned abo= ve, all the aforesaid documents were in aid of and supportive of the PPA da= ted 8.12.1993 (later amended as mentioned above).=20  Elections were called for by a press note dated 8.12.94 and a notification = date 10.1.95 and were held from 9-12 February, 1995, but announcement of re= sults was deferred in order to complete election process in other States wh= ich were to take place. It was this deferment of results which was taken ad= vantage of and  the letters/agreements were executed and/or exchanged durin= g this period.=20  * By reason of Clause 2 of PPA, the status of the PPA was that of an agreem= ent not enforceable by law until all conditions precedents had been fully s= atisfied and/or bona fide waived as provided in the PPA itself. However, by=  a letter dated 25.2.1995 these conditions precedents were waived. The so-c= alled waiver was not bona fide but was deceptive and fraudulent.=20  * The unholy haste with which the purported financial closure was sought to=  be achieved was clearly in order to reap the benefit of the huge sum of $2= 0 million admittedly already spent by the principal shareholder of the Firs= t Defendant (Enron) described by them euphemistically as `educational expen= ses'; (the testimony of Ms Linda Powers specifically states that:=20  ``Moreover, our company spent an enormous amount of its own money approxima= tely $20 million on this education and project development process alone no= t including any project costs... Why do we, and other developers include su= ch things in our project? To win local support and support of the authoriti= es, and contribute to the general improvement of conditions, and contribute=  to the general improvement of conditions in the area''. In the purported r= efutation also enclosed in the letter dated 18.8.1995 of the First Defendan= t, it is stated that $20 million included ``engineering, financing, legal, = travel and administrative costs actually totalling a sum in excess of $20 m= illion as of 29.3.1995.'')=20  * 20.6.1992 -- (within five days of arrival in India and within three days = of arrival in Bombay) The Enron team arrived in India on June 15 and spent = two days visiting various sites in addition to meeting people in Delhi and = Bombay. A  memorandum of understanding was signed between the Second Defend= ant  (represented by Mr Ajit M. Nimbalkar), then Chairman of the Second Def= endant, Ms Rebecca Mark of Enron, and Mr Douglas Mcfadden of General Electr= ic Corporation.=20  The term sheet annexed to the MoU opens with the following:=20  ``Electrical Power Purchase Contract'' -- Contract for 20 years term betwee= n Power Venture and MSEB to be structured to achieve an all in price of US$=  0.073/kWh, comprised a fixed monthly capacity payment calculating at the I= ndian rate of inflation each year and a per-kWh energy payment equal to the=  per-kWh operating cost (as defined below).=20   (ii) Thus, the purported decision to set up a huge power generation projec= t in the private sector with a foreclosed obligation on a statutory corpora= tion to buy power from the private sector at a predetermined unprecedentedl= y high rate was taken in a great hurry without there being any public debat= e on the said issue  apart from there being any detailed consideration of t= he matter.=20  * Before the PPA was executed in December 1993, the following events occurr= ed:   (a) The World Bank expressed its opposition to the project and advised tha= t it was not viable, not in the interest of Maharashtra in particular and t= he country, the public and the consumers, in general. This objection was br= ushed aside by Enron which said, in a letter, that ``the World Bank opinion=  can be changed'', that ``we (Enron) will engage a PR firm and hopefully ma= nage the media from here on'' (June 1993).=20  * The Central Electricity Authority had drawn attention to several aspects = of the MoU including:=20  (i) The all-in price is a departure from the existing norms and parameters = notified by the Government under Section 43 A(2) of the Electricity (Supply= ) Act, 1948.=20   (ii) Denominating the price in US dollars is also a departure from the exi= sting norms.=20  (iii) We take it that the price of 0.073 kWh will be applicable from 1996 w= hen power would be available.=20  * The PPA violates the tariff guidelines in force issued on December 8, 199= 3. The tariff guidelines permitted only a return of 16 per cent on equity b= ut the PPA allows a return much in excess of 25 per cent. Second, the tarif= f notification puts a cap on Operation and Maintenance (O&M) charges at 2.5=  per cent of the capital cost. In the case of the PPA the O&M changes were = over Rs 90 crore annually which is over three per cent of the capital cost.=  The PPA was not even structured in accordance with the said notification.= =20  The tariff notification allows payments only for the actual fuel consumed a= nd not for deemed consumption. In the present case the heat rate guaranteed=  by the Dabhol Power Company to the MSEB is 7605 BTU per unit while the hea= t rate guaranteed by GEC to DPC is considerably lower. Under the PPA about = 25 per cent  of this difference and deemed consumption and actual consumpti= on is allowed to be retained by DPC, contrary to the tariff notification.= =20  All these are but a few paragraphs of the 600-page civil suit. Perhaps had = the then Maharashtra Government persisted with the arbitration the compensa= tion would have been far less than what could be anticipated now. However, = for reasons best known to the BJP-Shiv Sena combine, the suit was withdrawn=  and its government appointed a review committee which integrated the LNG p= lant with the power plant and gave the green signal for the second phase. T= he net result was a higher tariff than what was negotiated by the Pawar Gov= ernment.=20  The project has come a full circle now. Now the effort is on to distribute = the burden across the country. This is evident by the Maharashtra Governmen= t turning to the Centre and its representative A. V. Gokak, and stating tha= t the Centre is evaluating various options including of the Power Trading C= orporation to buy the power from DPC and distribute it to all the States. B= ut at what price? Not lower than negotiated under the PPA of course with co= smetic concessions by Enron and a lot of sacrifices by the State and the Ce= ntre. But is this what we want?=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- MID DAY, Monday, May 28, 2001 DPC rejects MSEB's legal notice  Enron's Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has rejected Maharashtra State Electrici= ty Board's (MSEB) legal notice for 'rescinding' the PPA, saying 'it did not=  have the right to do so', as the two partners cross swords before state El= ectricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) tomorrow.  In a three-page response = to MSEB's May 24 legal notice, Enron India managing director K Wade Cline h= as said "" The legal notice is not acceptable to us, as according to the PPA= , MSEB does not have the right to rescind the agreement"", state government = sources told correspondents today.The letter, dated May 26, also asks MSEB = to comply to the 'sanctity' of the PPA, "" please confirm that the board wou= ld also pay all DPC dues, including the disputed Rs 213 crore for December = and January bills plus the interest"".  In its notice, MSEB has questioned the legal validity of the entire PPA as = per the Indian Contracts' Act (ICA) 1872 and later also went a step further=  by filing a petition in MERC. "" Other than non-acceptance of our legal not= ice, DPC has continued its demand for an escrow account, knowing fully well=  that MSEB has filed a caveat in the Mumbai high court for not activating t= he same"", sourcesinformed. DPC has also demanded an increase in LC (letter = of credit) amount in line with the PPA, as MSEB was supposed to do 21 days = before the firing of its second phase on June 6, they said","BUSINESS STANDARD Monday, May 28, 2001, http://www.business-standard.com/today/finance8.asp?M= enu=3D5 DPC lenders take a hard line, oppose MSEB move, Tamal Bandyopadh"

Hoping that both the parties will solve the imbroglio mainly = concerning the disposal of costly power, he said the steps initiated by the=  state government and the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) are in the right direc= tion of resolving the issue. Addressing a press conference immediately after his arrival at the Mumbai a= irport, Mr Vajpayee shared the state government's sentiments on the purchas= e of the ""costly"" Dabhol power. The prime minister admitted that there are = difficulties in finding a solution to the Enron issue, but he was confident=  that it would ultimately be found. By putting the ball in the court of the=  state government and DPC, the prime minister has made it amply clear that = the Centre would not like to associate itself directly to either purchase D= abhol power or its despatch to various states until tariff is reduced after=  renegotiation. Mr Vajpayee's remarks have come as a major setback to the s= tate government as it has been appealing to him for the takeover of the Dab= hol phase-II in view of its inability to bear the mounting burden. Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, in his recent communication to Vajpayee o= n February 6, April 17 and May 10, repeatedly demanded that Dabhol's surplu= s power be disposed by national organisations such as the NTPC and the Powe= r Trading Corporation in power deficit states. ""The negotiations with DPC w= ith a view to reducing the tariff hinge around the question whether the ent= ire power from this project at 90 per cent PLF would be purchased. DPC may = be willing to reduce tariff from the existing high levels, provided they ge= t such an assurance from the government of India,"" Mr Deshmukh had said.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --------------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Thursday, June 07, 2001=20 ...but Deshmukh insists Centre should help resolve the dispute=20  THE Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on Wednesday said that hi= s government's stand that the state cannot afford to buy ""costly"" Dabhol po= wer has ultimately been vindicated by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. = ""We stick to our position that the Centre should step in to bail out the st= ate as we cannot bear the additional burden. The purchase of additional 722=  MW from block b of Dabhol phase-II is simply out of question as the state = has not drawn more than 300 MW from the Dabhol phase-I of 740 MW,"" Mr Deshm= ukh said. Mr Deshmukh was reacting to the prime minister's statement that i= f Maharashtra cannot purchase such costly power who else would buy it.Mr De= shmukh told reporters after the weekly Cabinet meeting that something would=  emerge from the ongoing renegotiations between the Maharashtra State Elect= ricity Board (MSEB) and the Dabhol Power Company. ""However, DPC will have t= o sacrifice something and the MSEB will also have to do some balancing act = for the resolution of the Dabhol issue,"" he added. Mr Deshmukh admitted that the he has been consistent on his demand that the=  Centre should take over Dabhol phase-II which is the only way in which the=  complex problem of this project can be resolved. The chief minister said t= hat his government will seek legal opinion on how to tackle the arbitration=  proceedings initiated against it by the DPC. He added that at present the = MSEB has got stay from the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission on=  implementation of arbitration process by the DPC. ""Let the DPC take action=  on this front against the state government, we will take the necessary ste= ps after seeking legal advise,"" he added. On making the Dabhol papers open for public, Mr Deshmukh said that his gove= rnment will also seek legal advise in this regard and take necessary action=  thereafter. At present, DPC has declined to release certain documents on t= he grounds of ""confidentiality."" Mr Deshmukh ruled out any possibility of a= dverse impact on receiving foreign direct investment in the state in view o= f the ongoing Dabhol imbroglio. ""The question does not arise, as according = to the power purchase agreement between DPC and MSEB, the latter was entitl= ed to purchase all power. In case of FDI, the state is not entitled to buy = the products of the FDI investor,"" he added.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Thursday, June 07, 2001,=20 DPC lenders to continue talks on Thursday=20  THE talks between Indian and foreign lenders of the Enron-promoted Dabhol P= ower Company will continue Thursday in Singapore. The DPC is reported to ha= ve made a presentation at the meeting Wednesday and explained its disputes = with Maharashtra State Electricity Bord and the pending case in the state r= egulatory commission, financial institution sources said here.=20  Thursday's meeting is scheduled with foreign banks.=20  Earlier, in a desperate bid to convince foreign banks to not invoke guarant= ees issued by them, Indian lenders to the Dabhol Power Company assured inte= rvention by the central government in salvaging the project. Institutional = lenders run the risk of guarantees worth Rs 2,463 crore being invoked by fo= reign lenders, who are under pressure to prevent their loans from going bad= . During the DPC lenders' meet in Singapore on Tuesday, Indian lenders aske= d foreign ones to not take ""individual decisions"" in respect of loans to th= e project. Instead, they should wait for the outcome of negotiations. The l= enders meeting was also attended by senior DPC officials. Among foreign ban= ks, senior officials from Citibank, ABN Amro, ANZ Grindleys, Bank of Americ= a and Opec were present.=20  The 2,184-MW power project, with an estimated cost of $2.9bn, stopped gener= ation last week following MSEB's decision not to buy power from the DPC. Th= is has aggravated the matter, making it difficult for the lenders to adopt = a softer stand. Indian lenders have guaranteed loans by foreign banks and i= nstitutions to the extent of $524 million (Rs 2,463 crore). The guarantees = given by lead institution IDBI alone is around Rs 1,528 crore while its tot= al exposure to the project stands at Rs 2,158 crore. The other major Indian=  lenders include ICICI, State Bank of India and Canara Bank. Indian lenders=  are worried that foreign banks would invoke the guarantee if the current s= talemate continues. ""However, lenders have to depend on the central governm= ent, MSEB and the DPC to resolve the issue. Indian lenders can only mediate=  between the government and DPC and also plead with foreign lenders not to = pull the plug,"" said an analyst. Officials who attended the meeting said,= =20  ""We hope to arrive at some decision by tomorrow."" DPC is expected to make a=  presentation to the lenders on Wednesday while small foreign banks will be=  meeting on Thursday. Asking foreign banks not to take an individual decisi= on is because of the fear that foreign lenders are considering invoking the=  guarantee. ""Although Indian banks maintain that foreign banks are not cons= idering invoking the guarantees, it definitely appears that they are consid= ering such a move given the stringent accounting norms followed in the inte= rnational market,"" an analyst pointed out. -=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --------------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Thursday, June 07, 2001=20 DPc foreign lenders to hold their horses , Sanjay Jog & Sitanshu Swain   IN a significant turn of events, the foreign lenders to the Dabhol Power C= ompany (DPC) have decided to adopt a wait-and-watch approach, rather than p= recipitate matters on the basis of the termination notices served by both p= arties - the power company and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSE= B) - on each other. This development comes even as the lenders' meeting rol= led on to an unscheduled third day to iron out further issues among themsel= ves. This decision was taken after two days of hectic deliberations among the le= nders where the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI)-led domestic le= nders briefed their foreign counterparts about the positive signs relating = to the continuance of the power project, top sources associated with the me= eting told The Financial Express on Wednesday evening. The sources said thi= s effectively means that the foreign lenders would not immediately insist o= n encashing the guarantees on their funds provided by the domestic lenders = to the project. The Dabhol lenders' meeting will now continue for an ""unsch= eduled"" third day on Thursday.=20 The lawyers of offshore lenders White & Case have confirmed that the meetin= g will continue on Thursday. However, the representative of Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) = Mr RS Agarwal left Wednesday's meeting mid-way to catch the flight back to = India. Sources said Enron India managing director K Wade Cline made a detai= led presentation for over two-and-half hours before the lenders. Mr Cline i= s believed to have outlined the series of events that have brought Enron to=  the brink of quitting India.Mr Cline said after the presentation: ""We have=  made a presentation. The presentation went well."" Dabhol Power Company, on=  its part, has already made it known that it is willing to revise some of i= ts earlier projections to suit the requirements of the state government. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --------------------------------------- THE INDIAN EXPRESS, Thursday, June 07, 2001 FIs buy more time in DPC lenders meet  The two-day meeting between Indian and foreign lenders of the Enron-promote= d, Dabhol Power Corp (DPC) remained inconclusive on Wednesday with foreign = lenders deciding to give some more time to the Indian government to decide = the fate of the project.While officials of Indian FIs (IFIs) decided to fly=  back on Wednesday, foreign lenders are expected to discuss among themselve= s on what action should be taken on the project on Thursday. IFIs have alre= ady sunk over Rs 5,000 crore on the project and if international lenders pu= ll the plug on the project, it would be IFIs which will have to take anothe= r Rs 2,463 crore hit on their balance sheet as they have guaranteed all the=  international loans taken by DPC.  IFIs, led by IDBI have already told the foreign lenders that they should no= t take any hasty decision as even the PM has intervened in the dispute. The=  foreign lenders include a consortium led by ABN-Amro, Citibank NA, Japan E= xim bank and OPIC. With this, foreign lenders have now decided to adopt a w= ait-and-watch posture instead of fighting with Indian lenders.The IFIs had = pressed for completion of the $3 billion project, as DPC has stopped commer= cial production and doubts are being expressed for commissioning of its 1,4= 44 MW phase-II due on Thursday. The Indian team, led by IDBI executive dire= ctor R S Agarwal, flew back to India alongwith representatives of SBI and I= CICI. On Wednesday, DPC also made presentations to the lenders about the fa= te of the project. Analysts say that foreign lenders cannot give much time = to the project as they have to follow stringent accounting norms followed i= n the international market. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Thursday, June 07, 2001=20 A step forward DABHOL Power Company is reportedly ready to extend the period for conciliat= ion till August. This is a good idea. Nobody, least of all Enron, which own= s the majority stake in DPC, gains from terminating a costly project sudden= ly. India is desperately short of electricity, whether or not Maharashtra c= laims that it can do without Dabhol power. The least that will be achieved = by extending the conciliation period will be a more organised withdrawal of=  Enron from the $2 billion project.=20 However, if MSEB, the governments of Maharashtra and India act sensibly, th= en the project can be salvaged by some renegotiation. Enron, which reported= ly plans to specialise in energy trading and pull out of power generation w= orldwide, might still pull out, but a renegotiated Dabhol will be a cheaper=  source of large volumes of electricity which India desperately needs. The = Godbole committee reckons that by renegotiating DPC's PPA and its gas contr= acts, and by some financial re-engineering, the cost of DPC electricity can=  be nearly halved. That will mean very attractive prices for electricity fr= om a new gas driven plant. It also means that domestic financial institutio= ns and banks, who have a huge exposure to Dabhol, will not have to contend = with the worrisome prospect of having to provide for loans that become non-= performing.=20 Meanwhile the government in New Delhi has to stop waffling about the need f= or reforms and get some work done. The first thing to do is to issue an ord= inance permitting all independent power producers to sell power to whoever = is willing to pay for it. Private investment is already allowed in transmis= sion and distribution. With generators free to sell to entities other than = SEBs, India will move towards a more competitive market for power. Privatis= ing power distribution has proved to be a mixed success - it has succeeded = to some degree in states like Orissa and flopped in UP, mainly because nobo= dy has faith in the government's ability to administer. Reforms of state ow= ned distribution networks and SEBs are uncertain and will take a long time = to succeed. In the meantime, it is a good idea to set up parallel, privatel= y owned and operated systems for generation, transmission and distribution = that will provide reliable, quality power to consumers who are willing to p= ay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --------------------------------------- BUSINESS STANDARD, Thursday, June 07, 2001 Dabhol to challenge MERC order in high court, Arijit De & S Ravindran=20 The legal battle between the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and the Maharashtra=  State Electricity Board (MSEB) has taken a fresh turn with the former deci= ding to challenge, in the Mumbai High Court, the order of the Maharashtra E= lectricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) restraining it from seeking recours= e to international arbitration till June 14. The case is slated to come up = for hearing on June 11, three days before the next MERC hearing. DPC's cont= ention, it is learnt, is that it is beyond MERC's jurisdiction to debar the=  company from proceeding with international arbitration. DPC has informed M= ERC about its decision in a communication dispatched this evening, MERC off= icials said.When contacted, the DPC spokesperson declined to comment on the=  issue. MSEB has slapped a claim of Rs 401 crore on DPC for non-supply of p= ower at adequate levels on January 28. In a submission before the commission, it also said that DPC has to pass on=  Rs 1,200 crore which had been paid as capacity charges. On May 29, MERC ha= d passed an interim injunction restraining DPC from going in for arbitratio= n on its payments dispute with MSEB till June 14. The commission had also t= aken the line that DPC could not activate the escrow account for the second=  phase of the project. The terms of the power purchase agreement inked betw= een MSEB and DPC provide for international arbitration between the two side= s if payments disputes arise. DPC lawyers had questioned MERC's authority t= o settle disputes with MSEB. They had argued that MERC, created in May 1999= , did not have the jurisdiction to adjudicate on disputes between DPC and M= SEB. The DPC argument was that since the amended PPA with MSEB had been ink= ed in 1998, there was no question of MERC having any role to play. MERC sou= rces concede that they cannot reopen the PPA. But they point to another ame= ndment to the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act on October 27, 2000, w= hich empowered MERC to settle all disputes between power utilities. The com= mission's stand is that since both DPC and MSEB are power utilities, it has=  the right to adjudicate on all disputes between the two. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --------------------------------------- BUSINESS STANDARD, Thursday, June 07, 2001 DPC to continue billing MSEB for Phase II power, S Ravindran=20 Dabhol Power Company (DPC) will continue billing the Maharashtra State Elec= tricity Board (MSEB) for the power generated from its phase II, which was d= ue to commence operations on Thursday. Sources close to DPC said: ""If MSEB = had fully cooperated with DPC, commercial production could have begun from = tomorrow. Under the power purchase agreement (PPA) they would have been for= ced to buy this power.""""While MSEB's contention is that they have rescinded=  the PPA, DPC's contention is that the PPA continues to be in force. Under = these circumstances, DPC will definitely charge MSEB for the second phase p= ower at some future date,"" the sources added.=20 MSEB has already stopped buying power from DPC. MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal = could not be reached for comment.

""The future of small power projects or dis= tributed generation in India is quite promising, compared to large power pl= ants,"" he said citing the company's growth in India.""Wartsila, India, is ad= ding about 200 MW power generation plants every year in India for the last = five year and the growth is likely to continue even in the future,"" he said= . Wartsila, India, has commissioned a number of distributed generating stat= ions in India in the last 15 years, which altogether crossed the installed = capacity by 2,000 MW. The power generation plants have been installed for i= ndustries, utilities and independent power producers (IPPs).  ""Out of the t= otal 2,000 MW power projects installed, 50 per cent of the capacity was add= ed in the last five years, showing the trend for small distributed generati= ng stations located close to the load centres,"" he said.  Stating, there is a large demand and supply gap in India, Mr Johansson said= : ""India is currently short in peak demand by about 11 per cent. According = to an estimate, about 1,00,000 MW will have to be added over the next 12 ye= ars to the existing generating capacity of about 1,00,000 MW, to support a = GDP growth rate of 6 per cent per annum.""Speaking about the Enron controver= sy, he said, ""The company, the foreign lenders involved in the projects, an= d both the state and the Central governments can find an amicable solution.= ""  He, however, added that the big plants are always difficult to finance, whe= reas there are little financial and completion risks involved in small powe= r projects. The company claims to install a captive power plant of 150 MW i= n about 14 months which can run on both furnace oil, as well as natural gas= .Stating that gas is the fuel of the future, Mr Johansson said that power g= enerated by using gas fuel is cheaper than oil by about Rs 1, depending on = the availability of gas and its market price. ""The cost of power generation=  is under Rs 3 per unit in case of gas, whereas in case of oil it is about = Rs 4 per unit,"" he said.

----------------------------------------  THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Thursday, May 24, 2001, Enron Drama In mumbai, Delhi makes gesture Godbole shakes govt to action Submits, takes back resignation=20  IN a day of dramatic developments, the Dabhol project renegotiation committ= ee chairman Dr Madhav Godbole, who had resigned in the wake of the criticis= m by former chief minister Sharad Pawar on the functioning of the committee= , ultimately withdrew it on Wednesday evening after the state Cabinet affir= med ""full faith, support and confidence in the ability of the committee to = handle the complex and onerous task"". Dr Godbole, whose resignation early o= n Wednesday morning led to cancellation of a renegotiation committee meetin= g with the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) team,  told The Financial Express tha= t the next meeting would take place early next week.  He said the state Cab= inet had unanimously rejected his resignation sent to the chief  minister V= ilasrao Deshmukh and affirmed its full confidence in the committee.The DPC,=  which had decided to attend Wednesday's Godbole renegotiation committee me= eting, declined to comment.  Dr Godbole's resignation has literally shaken the Democratic Front (DF) gov= ernment in Maharashtra, which has been criticised day in and day out by som= e of its constituents on the Dabhol issue. Dr Godbole had   put in his pape= rs on Wednesday morning, following Mr Shard Pawar's statement that the  com= mittee's negative approach would not help resolve the Dabhol impasse.   Dr = Godbole, in his two-page resignation letter, is believed to have said that = it would be impossible to continue to function especially when the leader o= f one of the major constituents of the state government, the Nationalist Co= ngress Party (NCP), had criticised the functioning of the committee.  Dr Go= dbole had expressed his anguish over Mr Shard Pawar's remarks and seems to = have stated that it would not be proper on his part to discharge his duties=  when serious aspersions have been  cast on his abilities.  However, Mr Deshmukh and his deputy, Mr Chhagan Bhujbal, who is also the Na= tionalist Congress Party legislative party leader, were closetted in a meet= ing and thereafter decided upon a strategy to pacify Dr Godbole.   Thereaft= er, the state Cabinet wholeheartedly rejected Dr Godbole's resignation afte= r Mr Bhujbal clarified Mr Shard Pawar's statements appearing in a section o= f the press. Mr Deshmukh said he had appealed to Dr Godbole to withdraw his=  resignation and added that ""Dr  Godbole's indepth knowledge and experience=  makes him indispensible for handling a vexed issue  such as renegotiation = with the US energy giant.""  Mr Deshmukh told reporters after the Cabinet me= eting that it was the state government which had appointed Dr Godbole for r= enegotiating the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Dabhol Power Company (= DPC) and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and not any particu= lar individual. ""In fact, Dr Godbole's appointment was a Cabinet decision a= pproved by the members of Nationalist Congress Party,"" Mr Bhujbal said. ""Mr=  Sharad Pawar's statement has not been taken in the right spirit. Mr Pawar = had himself put his stamp on Dr Godbole's appointment,"" he added.  Moreover= , Mr Bhujbal said Mr Pawar had said that Maharashtra would not be able to c= onsume the  extra 1,900 mw generated by Dabhol Power Company and that the C= entre should play an active  role in reducing the high tariff.  Earlier, the DF constituents, specially the Janata Dal (S) and Peasants and=  Workers Party (PWP), made several visits and calls to the chief minister u= rging him to prevail upon Dr Godbole to withdraw his resignation ""in the la= rger interest of the state and its consumers.""   A veteran JD (S) leader Mr= inal Gore, accompanied by socialist leader PB Samant and Enron Virodhi Ando= lan convenor Pradyumna Kaul met Dr Godbole and made an appeal to withdraw h= is resignation.  The Janata Dal (S) came down heavily on Mr Pawar and alleg= ed that he wanted to appoint a pro-Enron man on the renegotiation committee= . However, Mr Pawar claimed that Dr Godbole's decision was a personal one. =  He said that he (Pawar) was not talking on behalf of the Maharashtra gover= nment when he commented on the ""negative approach"" of those leading the tal= ks. He reiterated that there was a need for renegotiations with Enron to re= duce the power tariff and the Godbole panel should complete its unfinished = work. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Thursday, May 24, 2001, Godbole does a Mamata; quits, then back   IT'S not a comparison that springs naturally to mind. But Madhav Godbole, = the former home secretary in charge of renegotiations with Enron, on Wednes= day managed a passable imitation of Mamata Banerjee by resigning in the mor= ning and withdrawing his resignation later in the day. In a day marked by c= onsiderable drama that briefly threatened the renegotiation process with En= ron, Godbole decided not to press for his resignation after chief minister = Vilasrao Deshmukh personally expressed ""full faith and confidence"" in his a= bility to ""handle the complex and onerous task of renegotiation"".=20  Earlier in the day, Godbole, who took offence to former chief minister Shar= ad Pawar's ""derogatory"" remarks, decided to walk out of the panel. Pawar ha= d last on Tuesday night said he was doubtful about the outcome of the ongoi= ng renegotiations between the state and DPC as those heading the state gove= rnment's panel did have a positive approach to resolve the issue. Godbole's=  swift decision to quit the panel sent shock waves at the Mantralaya -- hea= dquarters of the state government -- as it seemed to threaten the existence=  of the government. The Janata Dal, Peasants and Workers Party and other sp= linter groups went to the extent of saying they would pull  out of the nine= -party coalition if Godbole's resignation was accepted.=20  Following these development, the state government had to cancel the crucial=  second round of renegotiations with DPC slated for Wednesday. Enron and th= e Centre's                                           representative were to=  attend the meet. ""I have resigned due to the derogatory remarks made  agai= nst me by Sharad Pawar last night,"" Godbole said on  Wednesday morning. God= bole said instead of strengthening the negotiator's hands, such statements = ""loosen the concerned authority's grip over the fragile situation"". However= , chief minister Vilasrao Deshumukh appealed to him to reconsider his decis= ion. ""Godbole's in-depth knowledge and experience makes him indispensable f= or handling vexed issues such as renegotiation with the US  energy giant,"" = Deshmukh said.=20  Deshmukh, after the Cabinet meet, sent a letter to Godbole expressing full = confidence in him. ""Godbole should not respond to statements from those out= side the government,"" said Deshmukh.  Meanwhile, Pawar, too, tried to contr= ol the damage. ""It was my personal opinion that was not aimed at any partic= ular  person. Godbole should not have resigned. He should complete his task= ."" Interestingly, Chagan Bhujbal, the state's deputy chief minister, was pu= t on a re-fighting mission and asked to express faith in Godbole on behalf = of the NCP, led by Pawar. Later in the evening Godbole decided not to press=  for the resignation. ""I have received a letter from the chief minister exp= ressing full confidence in my abilities. It also states the views expressed=  by Sharad Pawar were his personal views. He has said the state government = had appointed me and they had no complaints against me. I, therefore, see n= o reason to press for my resignation,"" Godbole said. Meanwhile, the next me= eting of the renegotiating panel has been convened on May 29. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE TIMES OF INDIA, Thursday, 24 May 2001 Enron Endgame=20  As home secretary, Madhav Godbole was known as a no-nonsense administrator.=  His report on the Dabhol  Power Corporation deal - which he dubs ``an inex= cusable failure of governance'' - shows that he  still believes in calling = a spade a spade. Godbole, who was responsible for renegotiating the power-p= urchase agreement with Enron, is the man in the news. He had tendered his r= esignation as the chairman of the negotiating committee after Sharad Pawar = said ``those leading the talks from the government side                    =                      are working with a negative approach'', only to take  = it back on Wednesday evening after Pawar clarified  that he had not made th= is comment on the state's   behalf. On a day of such tumultuous development= s, he spoke to Aditya Chatterjeehours before withdrawing his resignation:= =20  You were appointed by the Maharashtra government to renegotiate the power p= urchase agreement with the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company. A key membe= r of the government, Sharad Pawar, has criticised you. Do you feel you have=  been let down?  The government should learn to first take a stand and then stand by it. As = you rightly pointed out, the Maharashtra government had appointed me as the=  committee head. And now, an important constituent of the government has al= leged that the negotiating committee  has a negative attitude. This type of=  a statement weakens the committee's stand on the crucial issue of renegoti= ating the power purchase agreement with the Dabhol Power Company. The gover= nment should try to give all the support to the committee and help strength= en it. Recent comments made by the senior Nationalist Congress Party leader=  are counter-productive in this light. I had put in my resignation letter b= ecause of the government's attitude. If the state government was not prepar= ed to place its full trust on my capabilities, there was no reason for me t= o stay on. Therefore, I had sent my resignation to the chief minister, Vila= srao Deshmukh.=20  Sharad Pawar was the chief minister of Maharashtra when the state had first=  signed an agreement with the US-based power major Enron in 1993-94. You we= re also regarded as the thorn in Enron's flesh. In fact, Enron has publicly=  said that it was not willing to  accept your committee's report. If you ha= d not recalled your resignation, would Enron and its  supporters havebenefi= tted?  I would not like to comment on this. It's for you to decide.=20  If the ongoing negotiations with Enron fail to break the deadlock, what wil= l be India's best strategy to initiate damage control?  Let me answer you this way. Two members of the Godbole committee had called=  for a judicial enquiry into the entire issue. Only a judicial enquiry can = get into details as to whether Enron had received any undue favour from the=  state, or whether facts were misrepresented knowingly by the authorities c= oncerned. It is also important to find out whether the contract signed with=  Enron is legally valid. The committee had also suggested that the judicial=  enquiry, headed by a serving or a retired Supreme Court judge, should be i= nitiated as soon as possible. One must understand that a committee like our= s has limited powers. We cannot, unlike a court, record evidence under oath=  and issue summons to the state government, the centre, financial instituti= ons and other autonomous bodies.=20  A judicial enquiry will have a two-fold advantage. One, Enron would know th= at the Indian government is serious about finding out the truth about the a= lleged wrong-doings. This will force Enron back to the negotiating table. S= econd, if the judicial enquiry is able to prove that there were indeed undu= e favours accorded to Enron, the power purchase contract will be no longer = binding for India.=20  Some senior economists argue that the price per unit  of power supplied by = Dabhol will come down  dramatically if the Maharashtra State Electricity Bo= ard purchases its entire output. What is your opinion?  That's a hypothetical argument. Even if we discount the fact that the MSEB = does not have the requisite funds to  purchase Enron's entire output, there=  is no way Maharashtra can utilise the entire 740 megawatt of power which i= s being produced by just the first phase of the Dabhol project. The state's=  power utilisation has been steadily dropping over the last two years becau= se of falling demand. In fact, a judicial enquiry could examine as to wheth= er the MSEB had presented an inflated demand scenario when the DPC project = was being conceived. The World Bank had actually raised doubts about the de= mand scenario then. The average power utilisation of the Dabhol project is = only about 30-40 per cent of Phase I. And, I am not  even counting the Phas= e II portion; that is completely unviable at this point of time.=20  So, does Maharashtra really need the Dabhol project?  I would say that Maharashtra only needs a marginal portion of the first pha= se of the Dabhol project.  At what terms, in your opinion, will the Dabhol project be viable for Mahar= ashtra?  The Energy Review Committee has discussed this aspect in its report. We fou= nd that the state would be able to find buyers for the power at Rs 2.50 per=  unit. As opposed to this, Dabhol Power Company sells its power at a variab= le rate between Rs 3.50 and Rs 8 - depending on the power utilisation by MS= EB.  Is your decision to resign final or will you consider withdrawing the lette= r if the state government requests you to continue?  I haven't considered this issue at this point of time.=20  Sharad Pawar did not specifically name you in his statement. He had actuall= y blamed the entire committee for having a negative approach. Do you think = that other conscientious members of the Godbole committee will now follow y= our lead and put  in their papers?=20  That is a possibility. But, it's for the other members to decide.  What is your future plan of action?  Well, I will continue working on the report which involves the second phase=  of the Dabhol project and restructuring the operations of the MSEB. The re= port will be completed over the next 10 days. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES , Thursday, May 24, 2001 Centre to avoid dispute with Maha on DPC  IN ITS first reaction after Dabhol Power Company issued the pre-termination=  notice last week, the Centre on Wednesday made it clear that it would cont= inue to play its role as a facilitator, but would not step in till such tim= e the state government walked out of the project Power ministry officials t= old The Economic Times that this was primarily to avoid any Centre-state di= spute in the crisis. The Centre would not require to intervene in case the = disputes were resolved bilaterally. ""We will step in with our suggestions o= nly when the state government has taken a final decision on whether to go a= head or scrap the project. The first move has to be taken by the state gove= rnment as the matter involves the Maharashtra government and DPC."" Union po= wer minister Suresh Prabhu who had been on a  foreign tour met finance mini= ster Yashwant Sinha on Wednesday to discuss the Dabhol power project, and t= he   financial implications of the pre-termination notice.=20  Although the finance ministry may not have to pay out anything immediately,=  it has to be prepared for its obligations under the counter-guarantee and = particularly when decisions have to be taken within a deadline. Senior offi= cials of the power and finance ministries are meeting on Friday to discuss = the DPC problem. However, concerned over the affects the Enron controversy = is having on other private investments, the power ministry issued a stateme= nt highlighting its efforts to solve the ongoing dispute. The Centre has as= sured lenders of the Dabhol power project that all steps would be taken to = resolve the ongoing crisis and steps have already been initiated for an ear= ly  settlement of the dispute between MSEB and DPC.=20  Prabhu has reiterated and confirmed that the Centre would be willing to con= sider any worthwhile idea emerging out of the consultations held by the neg= otiation committee for the settlement of the dispute. However, the solution=  has to be acceptable to both DPC and MSEB as they are the concerned partie= s. The Centre has, however, clarified that State-run National Thermal Power=  Corporation cannot be expected to bail out the Enron project as it would t= hen be unfair to keep all other  IPPs pending. ""There are several IPPS whos= e financial closure has been pending, and NTPC cannot be expected to bail t= hem out,"" sources said.

(PTI) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Thursday, May 24, 2001, Is Pawar playing power politics with Enron?, Girish Kuber=20  MAHARASHTRA'S former chief minister Sharad Pawar's statement criticising Ma= dhav Godbole, the head of the renegotiation team, and the timing chosen by = him to air his views, has focused attention on his role in the Enron contro= versy. Pawar, who had first inked the Enron deal as the chief minister of M= aharashtra in 1992, was at the center of controversy when the Opposition ac= cused him of favouring"" the US energy giant. The issue of Rs 64 crore being=  spent by Enron on ""educating"" Indians had become a political issue in the = 1995 state Assembly elections which Pawar lost. In more recent times, Pawar=  has repeatedly intervened at crucial junctures. On the eve of Wednesday's = session of the Godbole panel, Pawar criticised Godbole of having "" a negati= ve attitude"" about Enron. Though Pawar did not  name Godbole, the message w= as loud and clear. His statement comes at a time when the Maharashtra State=  Electricity is planning to issue a pre termination notice to Enron after t= he Godbole panel's scheduled meet on Wednesday.=20  The board officials had discussed the issue with the state's advocate-gener= al and were believed to have received a go-ahead from chief minister Vilasr= ao Deshmukh. Last October, when the state government had decided not to pay=  Enron's bills, Pawar convinced the state government to release Enron payme= nts. It was after his intervention that the state government decided to app= oint a committee  to review the project. Surprisingly, last month, when Des= hmukh had a meeting with Yashwant Sinha and Suresh Prabhu at Delhi, Pawar w= as seen accompanying the chief minister though his name did not figure on t= he official list of invitees. However, subsequently, the committee could no= t be formed since the faction loyal to Pawar in the state government was cl= early against Godbole's appointment.=20  State energy minister and Pawar's trusted aide, Padmasinh Patil, had public= ly expressed his ire against  Godbole. It was only after the Janata Dal, Pe= asents and Workers Party, CPI (M) and other anti-Enron groups threatened to=  withdraw support of the government, the Godbole Committee came into being.=  But not bofore a month was lost in a wrangling. Even after the committee's=  formation, Patil continued his tirade against Godbole. It was only chief m= inister Deshmukh's support that the Godbole Committee could survive the opp= osition from within. Political observers believe that it was the Congress' = strategy to support the Godbole Committee that at the end could expose the = wrongdoings of the earlier governments. As expected, the Godbole Committee,=  in its first report, exposed what it called the ""lack of governance at eve= ry stage"" in finalising the Enron deal. Godbole even  suggested a judicial = probe to pin those guilty for this ""faulty deal"". It was against this backd= rop that Pawar's views on Godbole created a flutter on Wednesday. Although = Godbole withdrew his resignation, it has certainly widened  the rift betwee= n the NCP and Congress. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Thursday, May 24, 2001, Pawar seeks probe on resignations of Godbole committee members, Sanjay Jog  THE Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar on Wednesday called u= pon the Maharashtra government to probe the reasons for the resignations of=  Mr RK Pachauri, Mr Kirit Parikh and Mr EAS Sarma from the Madhav Godbole r= enegotiation committee on Dabhol  project. Mr Pawar in an exclusive intervi= ew to the The Financial Express said the government should find out why the= se members had quit on the grounds of ""prior engagements."" He said the rene= gotiation is the best possible option for the reduction of Dabhol tariff.  =  Mr Pawar, whose party is a major constituent of the Democratic Front gover= nment in Maharashtra,  said that the state government is quite keen to reso= lve the Dabhol impasse. ""The state government's bonafide cannot be challeng= ed as it is quite serious to resolve the Dabhol imbroglio,"" he remarked.  He reiterated that the renegotiation committee as well as state government = should keep a positive   approach for the resolution of the issue. He said = that the Centre's intervention is a foregone conclusion as the Maharashtra = State Electricity Board (MSEB) was not in a position to absorb  nearly 1,90= 0 mw of power generated from the Dabhol plant. ""In fact, questions are bein= g raised about the purchase of even 500 mw from Dabhol Power Company,"" he a= dded. Mr Pawar said that the Centre would have to step in and help the MSEB=  to find a way for the disposal of excess power especially in the power def= icit states. He pointed out that the DPC's decision to serve preliminary te= rmination notice was in haste and uncalled for. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Thursday, May 24, 2001, Prabhu reassures DPC lenders=20  THE Centre has assured the lenders to the Dabhol Power Company (DPC)  that = all necessary steps will be taken to defuse the Dabhol power crisis.  In an=  official statement issued on Wednesday, the Union Power Minister, Suresh P= rabhu said, ""The government is ready to consider any worthwhile idea emergi= ng  out of the negotiating committee for the settlement of the dispute."" Si= gnificantly, this is the first official statement released by the Centre af= ter the issuance of the preliminary termination notice by DPC to the Mahara= shtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) a few days back. Sources said Mr Prabh= u also held discussions with the Union Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha on W= ednesday evening, over various issues concerning the Dabhol power project. = According to Mr Prabhu, a quick settlement of the Dabhol dispute is essenti= al and the Centre will give its full support to the implementation of any p= roposal, acceptable to DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSE= B) - the main parties to the dispute.  Sources said in order to allay the fears of the domestic lender community, = the finance ministry has already responded to the letters written by IDBI, = ICICI and SBI to the ministry, wherein they had sought the latter's interve= ntion in resolving the ongoing Dabhol crisis.  According to sources, the fi= nance ministry has asked the lenders not to panic as the government is maki= ng all possible efforts to resolve the crisis through the negotiations rout= e. ""The Dabhol project is not only important for Maharashtra but for the en= tire country and, therefore,  all possible efforts are being made by the Ce= ntre to revive this project,"" the officials said.  According to top governm= ent sources, a team of senior officials from DPC will also be meeting the  = top brass in the power and finance ministry on Friday. ""In order to reach a= n amicable solution to the  ongoing crisis, both sides will have to make so= me sacrifices. The details in this regard will be discussed with the DPC bi= gwigs on Friday,"" the sources said.  As per the official statement, the Centre has been proactively taking a num= ber of steps to find a solution to the Dabhol project. The Centre wants thi= s issue to be settled through the negotiation route and it has already depu= ted its representative - former telecom secretary AV Gokak on the negotiati= on panel.""Moreover, an inter-ministerial committee of joint secretaries has=  also been constituted to assist Mr  Gokak and to quickly examine the propo= sals emerging out of the negotiating committee,"" the statement said. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Thursday, May 24, 2001, Dabhol lenders hope for crisis resolution at Friday meeting=20  THE domestic lenders to the Dabhol power project, who along with foreign le= nders had suspended further disbursements for DPC phase-II, have pinned the= ir hopes on the  meeting called by the Centre on Friday in New Delhi to fin= d an amicable solution for the ongoing  Dabhol impasse. ""We are hopeful tha= t the meet, which will bring all the disputing parties together, will arriv= e at an   amicable solution for protecting the national interest,"" said a t= op officials of State Bank of India. ""We are not worried about the present = development and we are sure about a positive development at the end,"" he sa= id. Regarding the repayment of installments, the official said that he does=  not expect any problem till   September as the 'reserve fund' which takes = care of the quarter instalment has sufficient funds.  Also the suspension of further disbursements by the lenders is a temporary = measure which has no long-term implications on the project. ""As stipulated = by the PTN, they have got six months to sort out things and the time period=  is enough to settle the differences,"" he said. The domestic lenders have a= lso given various suggestions to the Centre and MSEB as to how to tackle th= e crisis.While the foreign banks are, to an extent, comfortable with the id= ea of the termination of the project as they have Centre's counter guarante= e for the phase I, the local banks and financial institutions have to worry=  about getting their exposure back as they are not at all covered by the co= unter guarantee.=20  However, the local lenders are confident that the profit making project, th= e insurance cover of which has been renewed recently, will be operational s= oon.The domestic lenders had also asked the Centre to convince MSEB and for= ce it to restrain from issuing a PTN to DPC.   They may also skip the forth= coming two-day global lenders meet during June 4-6 in Singapore to discuss = the implication of PTN served by the DPC to MSEB.  The Indian lenders, led = by the Industrial Development Bank of India, SBI and ICICI, have lent aroun= d $1.4 billion out of a total $3 billion for the 2,184 mw project. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- MID-DAY, May 23, 2001=09 Enron renegotiation to begin next week'    By: Yogesh Naik  The phone rings incessantly at the Godboles 16th floor apartment at Buena V= ista just 200 metres away from Mantralaya. The retired Home Secretary, Madh= av Godbole, who had been recently appointed as the chairman of the renegoti= ations committee, answers each one of them and speaks to the media men who = ask him whether he has taken back his resignation as chairman of the Enron = renegotiations panel or not.  A visibly upset Godbole answers each call unt= iringly. "" I have taken back my resignation after the chief minister sent m= e a letter saying that the entire cabinet had expressed faith in my work.""   Godbole had submitted a resignation to the CM, Vilasrao Deshmukh last morn= ing following a 'derogatory statement' from Nationalist Congress Party chie= f, Sharad Pawar saying that he was apprehensive of the outcome of the discu= ssions as those leading the talks from the government side had a negative a= pproach. Pawar had made a statement to the media on Tuesday evening. The NC= P chief did a volte-face by retracting it.  Godbole told Chalomumbai, "" Eve= n I had seen him on television as many of you reporters did. He said someth= ing else on the television and he is saying something else now. That' s the=  way, world is."" Though the Power Purchase Agreement with Dabhol Power Corp= oration is very tight. Godbole feels, "" PPAs have renegotiated worldwide. W= hy can it not be done here.""   Though some allegations have been leveled Godbole report on Enron, the Pun= e based retired home secretary is known for his honesty and integrity. The = state government just provides him with remuneration of Rs 10000 per month = and to and fro transportation, while the lawyers who defend the case in the=  international courts are paid upto 400 pounds an hour.  Yesterday, Deshmuk= h tried a lot to undo the damage done to Godbole. He also clarified that no=  one from the government had criticised Godbole. Godbole was supposed to he= ar the US energy giant yesterday but the hearing could not take place. The = Godbole resignation episode coupled with the resignations of three other me= mbers earlier this month has given a setback to the renegotiations. But God= bole says that the renegotiations will begin early next week. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, May 23, 2001 Power trading corp to be roped in for disposing of Dabhol power , Sanjay Jo= g=20  THE BJP-led government at the Centre, which had come under severe attack fo= r being a silent observer, has ultimately decided to step in to resolve the=  ongoing Dabhol impasse. The Centre has asked the Union ministry of power t= o prepare a comprehensive proposal for the consideration of the union cabin= et for roping in the state-run Power Trading Corporation (PTC) for  the dis= posal of Dabhol power in power deficit states across the country. Top sourc= es told The Financial Express on Wednesday that the Centre has asked the Un= ion power ministry to project the requirement of finances for the PTC to ma= ke the trading of Dabhol power a reality. ""The Centre's nominee and former = bureaucrat nominated on the Madhav Godbole renegotiation committee for the = Dabhol project, AV Gokak, has been given the mandate in this direction. The=  Union ministry is expected to submit a necessary proposal in this regard v= ery shortly,"" sources said.  The inter-ministerial team, comprising secretaries of ministries of power, = finance and oil and natural gas have reportedly made a strong recommendatio= n in this connection, following the refusal by the National Thermal Power C= orporation (NTPC) to enter into the picture by dispatching Dabhol power. So= urces said that former Maharashtra chief minister Sharad Pawar is believed = to have  played a major role in convincing the Centre to intervene directly=  to enable the Dabhol crisis to blow  over. In fact, Maharashtra chief mini= ster Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh, in his successive communications to the   Prime = Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on February 6, April 17 and May 10, had appea= led that the  surplus power generated by the DPC would have to be disposed = by national organisations such as NTPC and PTC, in power deficit states. ""T= he negotiation with DPC with a view to reducing the tariff of power from th= e Dabhol project, hinges around the question whether the entire power from = this project at 90 per cent plant load factor, would be purchased by a cred= it-worthy purchaser or not. The DPC may be willing to reduce the tariff fro= m the existing high levels, provided they get such an assurance from the go= vernment of India,"" Mr Deshmukh added. According to sources, PTC has alread= y stepped into the field of inter-state trading of power by identifying sur= plus and deficit states and regions and providing commercial payment arrang= ements. PTC traded power from Maharashtra to Karnataka for Jindal Vijaynaga= r Steel to the extent of 28.35 million units of energy during 1999-00 and 1= .44 million units during 2000-01. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, May 23, 2001 State refers DPC dispute to MERC ,  Sanjay Jog  THE Maharashtra government, in a tactical move, has decided to refer the on= going Dabhol disputes to the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission = (Merc) mainly to ""buy time.""  The state cabinet on Wednesday has approved t= his proposal and is believed to have directed the chief secretary and power=  secretary to complete the necessary formalities in this regard. Mantralaya=  sources told The Financial Express that the state government has already i= nformed its  intent to Merc in this connection. Merc has already been deleg= ated adequate power under section 22 (2)(n) of the Electricity Regulatory C= ommission Act 1998 to ""adjudicate upon the disputes/differences between the=  licencees and utilities and refer the matter for arbitration"" through a go= vernment notification issued on December 5, 2000.  The state government had delegated these powers to Merc, when it had referr= ed the disputes between the Tata Power and BSES over the payment of standby=  charges. At present Merc is holding hearings on a petition filed by BSES i= n this connection. The disputes related to the issuance of preliminary term= ination notice arbitration notice, political  force majuere and non payment=  of rebate of Rs 401 crore by the DPC to Maharashtra State Electricity Boar= d (MSEB) for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power on Jan= uary 28, would be referred to the Merc for its consideration and ruling. Ac= cording to sources, this would  defer the proposed proceedings on arbitrati= on notices served by the DPC, as these proceedings are  likely to commence = within a month.  ""The idea of referring these disputes arisen between the MSEB and DPC is wi= th an objective to buy time, as well as transfer legal battles on the India= n soil,"" a senior minister said. He added that the DPC, would have to under= go the Merc route and thereby it could go on challenging its orders in the = Bombay High court and thereafter in the Supreme Court. Sources said that th= e DPC's move to serve PTN, was unwarranted especially when the MSEB has not=  defaulted on the payment of monthly bills, neither it had expressed intent=  in this regard. MSEB and state government, whose stand has been backed by = the Centre, have justified the rebate claim made by the MSEB, for misdeclar= ation and default on the availability of power. Both state government and M= SEB have also refuted the DPC's allegations, regarding the political  inter= ference and have said that MSEB was not entitled to make the payment of Dec= ember (Rs 102  crore) and January (Rs 111 crore) bills, as it could be adju= sted against the rebate payment by DPC. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ASIAN AGE, May 23, 2001 MSEB Fails to submit report, Rajesh Unnikrishnan  The Maharashtra State Electricity Board has failed to submit confidential d= ocuments and reports to the NGO, Prayas, as directed by the Maharashtra Ele= ctricity Regulatory Commission, on three controversial power projects in Ma= harashtra - the Enron-promoted Dabhol power project, Reliance promoted Pata= lganga project and Ispat Industry's Bhadrawati project. Based on a petition=  filed last year by Prayas, a Pune-based non-governmental organisation, whi= ch sought confidential documents on various agreements signed by MSEB and t= he promoters of these power projects, Merc had asked the state electricity = board to give the NGO the documents requested. However, MSEB did not produc= e all the documents requested by Prayas.=20  The NGO has now filed a contempt petition before the Merc, which will be he= ard on Thursday. On the DPC, Prayas had asked for clearance notifications i= ssued by various ministries and government departments, various directives = of government and documentary evidence indicating fulfilment and achievemen= t of these clearances or directives, condition precedent as set out in Sect= ion 2 of the DPC-MSEB power purchase agreement that have either been met or=  waived by DPC or MSEB. Prayas also asked for the mathematical and computer=  models being used by MSEB to calculate or verify the payments to be made t= o DPC. MSEB produced only partial clearances, and some of them were even in= complete. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- BUSINESS STANDARD, Thursday, 24 May 2001 Cat amongst the pigeons Maharashtra's debacle over Enron's Dabhol project seems to have set the cat=  amongst the pigeons. Karnataka has decided to review as many as 11 private=  power projects. It seems to have suddenly realised that it, too, may be be= ing taken for a ride and wants to see if it can get independent power produ= cers (IPPs) to lower their tariffs. Fresh protests have been heard, meanwhi= le, against the likely cost of power from the Maheshwar hydel project in Ma= dhya Pradesh. And a fracas has developed in Orissa between Gridco and an IP= P. If anyone thought that the path to privatising the power basis would be = either smooth or easy, he had better think again. But 10 years down the roa= d from the time privatisation of electricity was first thought of, have any=  lessons been learnt? Given the amazing features of the Dabhol power purcha= se agreement (PPA), suspicion about the nature of private power deals would=  be entirely warranted, as only the na?ve would now hold that these PPAs do=  not require a second look.=20 Recent experience with India's politicians suggests that either out of igno= rance or just plain knavery, but also because of the reality of commercial = risk, the IPPs may well have walked away with more than their fair due. The= re is a problem, of course, in determining what this is. But as the Enron P= PA shows, it is possible to sneak in all sorts of hidden costs that have th= e ultimate effect of raising the tariff payable by the purchaser. Take the = Karnataka example. The cost of thermal power (mostly) from the six stations=  of the Raichur thermal power station, is around Rs 2.20 per unit, and the = cost of central purchase is about Rs 1.46 per unit. The purchase from one i= ndependent power producer (IPP), Jindal Tractabel Power, is at Rs 2.60 a un= it.=20 It is true that power from new projects will cost more than power from olde= r ones. The question is, how much more. On average, power from the coal-bas= ed public sector plants costs around Rs 2 to generate. The cost of power fr= om the newest amongst them, such as the NTPC one at Simhadri, is around Rs = 1.80 per kilowatt-hour. In contrast, the IPPs are charging over Rs 2.40. Th= e key issue, therefore, is to agree on how much more the power from an IPP = should cost. There is good reason why private power producers will budget f= or higher returns. They see the risks flowing from poor distribution system= s, high transmission/distribution losses, the poor financial condition of t= he electricity boards, and the chaotic power tariff structure, and realise = that entering a minefield such as this must only be for higher than normal = reward.=20 The official response of offering insurance against system risk, through co= unter-guarantees and escrow accounts, has now run into a dead end. What rem= ains now is to do the obvious thing: reform the distribution and tariff str= uctures and introduce greater commercial sense into the power sector. If th= ese are done, and if the electricity boards and governments have learnt how=  to negotiate, then private investment in electricity generation can come a= t lower cost. If these are not done, prepare for either no electricity or v= ery costly electricity.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- BUSINESS STANDARD, Thursday, May 24, 2001 The 'base load' question=20 This second extract from the Godbole Committe report highlight serious flaw= s in the basic design of the Dabhol project MSEB, in its affidavit in the Ramdas Nayak case, affirmed that: ""protracted=  negotiations and discussions took place between both the parties during th= e period August 1992 to December 1993"". As a consequence of these negotiati= ons, ""at 90% power availability the estimated total tariff in 1997 prices, = at an exchange rate of Rs. 32/- =3D $1 and distillate price of $4.3/mmbtu w= ill be Rs. 2.40/kwH"". The quality of these ""protracted negotiations"" can be=  judged by comparing this rate of 7.5 cents per kwH with 7.3 cents per kwH = in the original MoU Term Sheet and more significantly, with the price ""prop= osed by Enron"" two months later in the Power Purchase Agreement: Heads of T= erms, Draft 4, dated 29 August 1992 (revised), where the tariff structure w= as to be designed to achieve an ""all-in price to MSEB of 6.91 cents per kwH=  (at 1996 prices) assuming a natural gas cost...of US $4.91/mmbtu."" That is= , at the start of negotiations, at a higher assumed fuel price, the all-in = cost was lower by nearly 0.6 cents per unit (an annual outgo of over $100 m= illion). The protracted negotiations seem to have led to an increase in pri= ce.=20 MSEB and the state government averred repeatedly before the Courts that thi= s project was intensively negotiated over a long period of 16 months and be= st possible terms were obtained from the foreign party, namely, Enron. The = very first document signed by MSEB with Enron and GE was the MOU, which was=  signed within 5 days of their coming to India and within 3 days of coming = to Mumbai. The Enron team first arrived in New Delhi on 15 June 1992 and th= e MOU was signed on 20 June 1992. Though the MOU makes it clear that it is = not legally binding on the parties, it sets the tone for future negotiation= s of the project. Interestingly, all the main features of the project have = basically remained the same throughout the so-called intensive negotiations=  that ensued after the signing of the MOU.=20 MSEB agreed, in principle, to a LNG based project of 2000 MW capacity being=  put up as a base load station without going into the question of the absor= ption of this large power in the Maharashtra system and the cost implicatio= ns thereof. It agreed to orders for the plant and equipment being placed on=  GE without going into the comparative costs thereof and without bothering = about the international competitive bidding. The contract was to be denomin= ated in dollars, payable in rupees. The only major difference was that the = power venture was to include the power plant but not gas facilities, which = were to be owned in a separate fuel venture, to be negotiated separately. S= ubsequently, this separation was offered as a concession in the renegotiati= on of the project in 1995 but later on retained as a part of the project to=  avoid a fresh clearance from CEA.=20 As mentioned above, DPC has been designed as a base load project, right fro= m inception. The World Bank in its assessment of the project, in 1993, poin= ted out that ""Dispatch[ing] the plant as a base load unit at 80-85% minimum=  plant factor...would prevent the operational flexibility of a combined cyc= le plant"". ... Maharashtra and MSEB need load-following capacity, not for m= eeting base load but for peak and intermediate load. The situation was the = same in 1993. It appears that the Planning Commission, at the CEA meeting h= eld to consider the project, also observed that from a ""system operation po= int of view it would perhaps be advantageous to consider setting up of pump= ed storage schemes in the Western region"" and that ""The backing down of the=  existing thermal generation capacity in Maharashtra due to this new capaci= ty addition would imply heavy additional economic costs imposed on the powe= r system of MSEB"".=20 Furthermore, it appears that at the same meeting one of the representatives=  of CEA observed that as ""per the studies conducted by CEA, Dabhol CCGT pla= nt was not the least cost option...MSEB had other less costly options such = as Kaparkheda Unit 3 & 4 (2X210MW), Kaparkheda-Unit 5 & 6 (2x250MW), Unred = TPS-1000 MW, but these schemes were in the preliminary stages."" The Committ= ee would like to point out at this stage that if MSEB had made efforts to s= eriously pursue these projects, they might not have remained in their ""prel= iminary stages"". Regardless of these apprehensions, the CEA found the techn= ical aspects of the scheme ""to be generally in order"". GoM went ahead with = the project as designed. Even though the execution of Phase-II was deferred= , the Phase I project continued to be considered as a base load project, an= d not as an intermediate load project, as evidenced by the calculation of t= ariff at 90% PLF.=20 If a lower level of dispatch was contemplated, as would be the case for a p= roject designed to meet intermediate loads, the estimated PLF would have be= en lower and consequently, the associate tariff would have been higher, sin= ce the same fixed costs would have been spread over a smaller base. The Com= mittee is of the opinion that MSEB and GoM erred seriously, based on inform= ation available at that time, in proceeding with DPC as a base load project= , even when it's capacity was reduced to 695 MW. It has been argued that th= ere were pending applications for power at that time. The World Bank in the= ir evaluation, considered this and rejected the argument because it was not=  demonstrated that the load was additional to normal growth, that consumers=  were willing to pay a higher price as would be needed for LNG power (indee= d, its surveys of willingness to pay showed otherwise), that they were will= ing to defer their demand until DPC came up and whether the load in questio= n was from continuous process industries, justifying a 90% PLF.=20 As the World Bank noted, ""under (MSEB's) assumption industrial load would d= ouble, i.e. grow at an average rate of about 20% for 4 years, compared to C= EA's already respectable 8% average annual growth."" As it happened, even CE= A's growth rate did not materialise ....Industrial consumption has hardly g= rown in the past few years.... The attitude of the CEA in according clearan= ce to this scheme is also questionable, especially given the record of disc= ussions in the meeting. Nowhere in the summary record are the issues relati= ng to the technical design of the project effectively addressed and yet, it=  was decided that the technical aspects were ""generally in order"".=20 A loss-reduction fairy tale=20 What happens if MSEB actually buys all the Phase II power? Can it really af= ford it if the realisations are rationalised and losses are reduced? To und= erstand this it is useful to do two simple exercises, each of which has thr= ee parts.=20 In the first part of the first exercise, all of MSEB's power purchase is fr= om DPC at the relatively reasonable rate of Rs. 4.10 per unit (as submitted=  by DPC to the Committee), but realisations for existing consumers (grouped=  into four broad groups of HT [high tension] and Commercial consumers. Bulk=  Supply Consumers, Agricultural Consumers and Domestic and Other Consumers)=  remain at current levels. This leads to a deficit of Rs. 4293 crore. In th= e second part, agricultural realisations are increased to Rs. 1.00 per unit=  and domestic realisations are adjusted so that MSEB's expenses are fully m= et (without any return). This implies a raise in average domestic realisati= ons of 193% to Rs. 5.27 per unit from the current realisations of Rs. 1.80 = per unit. Finally, in the third part, we ask what if there is an overnight = conversion of 10,000 MU of commercial losses into paying consumers (at an a= verage realisations of Rs. 2.75) i.e. an overnight additional revenue of Rs= . 2750 crore? Domestic realisations would still have to be increased by 58%= . So, the problem therefore is not just that of high commercial losses, tho= ugh it is a major problem. Even if the losses were fixed in the manner abov= e, there would remain a deficit of Rs. 1543 crore. The problem is that ther= e is not enough demand to absorb this power.=20 In the second part of this exercise, we project an overnight increase in de= mand of 13,350 MU, equal to DPC Phase II, which is distributed evenly acros= s all non-agricultural consumers, implying an overnight increase in consump= tion of 36%. If realisations stay at existing levels, this decreases the de= ficit to Rs. 3273 crore. In the second part, agricultural realisations are = again increased to Rs.. 1.00 per unit and domestic realisations are adjuste= d so that MSEB's expenses are fully met (without any return as before). Thi= s implies a lower raise of 117% in average domestic tariffs. In the third p= art, as before, there is an overnight conversion of 10,000 MU of commercial=  losses into paying consumers, i.e. an overnight additional revenue of Rs..=  2750 crore. In this case, finally, domestic realisations do not have to be=  increased.=20 This implies that if HT and Commercial realisations remain at their current=  excessively high levels, agricultural realisations rise to Re. 1.00 per un= it, i.e. double the existing tariff, and 10,000 MU of commercial losses is = converted into paying consumption at an average realisations of Rs.. 2.75. = non-agricultural consumption rises by 36% and agricultural consumption does=  not grow then it is possible for DPC to be absorbed without any increase i= n domestic realisations. However, even this fairy tale is too good to last.=  As time goes on, DPC tariff will rise and if it were Rs.. 4.50 instead of = Rs.. 4.10, then domestic realisations would have to be increased by 26%.","The Financial Express Thursday, May 24, 2001, http://www.financialexpress.com/fe20010524/top1.html Enron Drama In mumbai, Delhi makes gesture Godbole shakes govt to action Submits, takes back resignation=20 THE ECO"

These are actual port costs using the LPG/C Nelly Maersk which is the vessel servicing Empire Gas Company this year.    The following are the port costs estimates (quite close):   1.  Barrels discharge per trip at CORCO - 30,000 bbls., Tropigas - 24,000 bbls., Liquilux - 20,000 bbls.,  One trip is three       ports and another trip is two ports per month.   2.  Discharge rates were given to us on an hourly basis and the agents took the average time per docking:  CORCO -                               48 hours or 625 bbls/hr., Tropigas - 28 hours or 857 bbls/hr., Liquilux - 20 hours or 1,000 bbls/hr.,    3.  Port costs at:     Tallaboa $18,000   CORCO $18,000   Tropigas $13,000   Liquilux $17,000       Liquilux port costs are per the Port of Ponce tariffs which are different from the Puerto Rico Ports Authority tariffs                      which apply to Tallaboa, Guayanilla and San Juan.  At San Juan (Tropigas) the tug boats cost less due to the fact                      that all tug boats companies are docked within the San Juan bay.   4.  Port costs are not included in the vessel costs.     5.  Port costs includes dockage, wharfage, harbor pilots, tug boats, and harbor fees.  ProCaribe charges the                       dockage and warfage to the shipping agent.  All these costs are charged by the shipping agent to the owner of the        vessel, the owner of the vessel then charges the charter party.   6.  Other costs:  Crudita - $4/barrel., Customs - $610.00 (Custom entry service $125, Custom duty deposit $485).,                       Laboratories - $135/test (3 - 5 per ship)., Inspectors - $0.1780 per long ton., Loss Control Agent - $0.35 per MT.,    7.  Days steaming from Jose Venezuela to Puerto Rico and in between island ports:                   Jose to Puerto Rico (Ponce, Guayanilla and Tallaboa) - 36 hours                San Juan to Jose - 46 hours                CORCO to Ponce - 2 hours                Ponce to San Juan - 14 hours                       CORCO to San Juan - 14 hours        These timings are from dock to dock.   8.

Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company on April 9 had invo= ked the political force majeure clause. DPC had indicated it was not in a p= osition to fulfil its contractual  obligations to MSEB because of political=  circumstances  beyond its control. MSEB in a reply on Monday denied Enron'= s allegation of  'political circumstances' and said there was no reason why=  it should have felt insecure. ""Such a step was necessary under the Power P= urchase Agreement and related security documents to notify the board of 'ce= rtain events and to enforce our rights',"" DPC had said. However, according = to MSEB, such a step by DPC was uncalled for. For DPC, invoking the force m= ajeure clause was necessary as 'certain events occurred that are beyond the=  reasonable control of the affected party (DPC)'. MSEB has expressed surpri= se in a letter on Monday.=20  The energy major had dispatched the notice to MSEB, as an affected party, w= hich had been subjected to ""concerted, deliberate and politically motivated=  actions of state government, the Government of India and the Board, which = will have a material and adverse effect on DPC's ability to perform obligat= ions under PPA"". ""Given the cumulative effect of these political actions, D= PC determined that the political force majeure declaration is an appropriat= e mechanism for providing that notice, and that is  an appropriate and nece= ssary step in protecting DPC and  its stakeholders' rights,"" the statement = added. However, for MSEB this was 'yet another move' from Enron to avoid pa= ying Rs 402 crore penalty the MSEB has slapped on it for failing to supply = electricity as per the agreement. MSEB, in today's letter, reiterated its s= uggestion to adjust December 2000 and Januray 2001 bills, against the Rs 80= 0 crore penalty it has slapped on Enron for not supplying electricity as pe= r demand.

The meeting will also finalise the Centr= e's reply to the arbitration and conciliation notices served by the Dabhol = Power Company (DPC). Mantralaya sources told The Financial Express that sta= te principal secretary (energy) VM Lal and Maharashtra State Electricity Bo= ard (MSEB) technical director Prem Paunikar will attend the meeting and app= rise Mr Kumar of the situation. The Centre, which has already appointed the=  Law Commission chairman Jeevan Reddy as a conciliator and proposed to adop= t a conciliatory route, is expected to submit its replies before June 4 (wi= thin 60 days since the issue of notices on April 4). Mr Kumar is likely to review the situation in the wake of suspension of loa= n disbursement by offshore lenders since April 25. The overseas lenders had=  agreed to show restraint in view of the Centre's indications of starting a=  fresh dialogue and constituting a committee for this purpose comprising it= s representative. The overseas lenders had demanded that the Centre dischar= ge its guarantee obligations by honouring the December last payment within = a week and that MSEB should hold back preliminary termination notice to DPC= . The lenders also sought MSEB to immediately reactivate the escrow arrange= ments and asked it to arrange for increase in the amount of letter of credi= ts from Rs 133 crore to Rs 357 crore. They also sought initiation of negoti= ation within three weeks. The state government and MSEB have, however, stuck to their stand and have = refused to pay the December (Rs 102 crore) and January (Rs 111 crore) bills=  to DPC on the grounds that it should be adjusted against the rebate of Rs = 401 crore served for misdeclaration and default on the availability of powe= r on January 28.

Moreover, in order to restore investors confidence and pr= omote foreign direct investment (FDI) in the power sector, the Centre shoul= d consider providing guarantees till the time the state electricity boards = (SEBs) become creditworthy.These are some of the recommendations made by le= ading investment banker, Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) in a recent pres= entation to the power ministry on 'Foreign Direct Investment in the Indian = Power Sector'. Says CSFB, ""The current market situation in India is not att= ractive to investors, when compared with other alternatives."" This, it said= , was mainly due to inconsistent regulatory framework, uncertain power purc= hase agreement (PPA) tariff structure, and the poor financial health of SEB= s, leading to payment concerns amongst the independent power producers (IPP= s) over there being no credit worthy offtaker of electricity. Taking note of the FDI experience in India's power sector, CSFB has noted t= hat little progress has been achieved even after 10 years of power sector r= eform and opening up of the sector to foreign investment. Besides this, it = added, there has been an uneven implementation of reform from state to stat= e.""Enron's Dabhol plant was the only thermal 'mega project' under productio= n, construction, for which there lies a bumpy road ahead with extremely vis= ible ups and downs. This would have an impact on FDI going forward,"" notes = CSFB. As per CSFB, only a few power projects have been able to close or are under=  construction and IPP development has virtually stalled. Moreover, nothing = has happened in the T&D sector. It attributed this to the weak financial po= sition of SEBs and the lengthy negotiation and re-negotiation process. Howe= ver, as against this, CSFB has pointed that energy market consolidation and=  liberalisation has resulted in tremendous opportunities in developed marke= ts such as the US and Europe. Moreover, upcoming privatisation programmes i= n countries like Singapore, the Phillipines, Korea, Thailand and China, wou= ld directly compete with India for FDI.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Tuesday, May 15, 2001 Merc to hear Prayas petition on May 16, Sanjay Jog THE Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (Merc) would hear on May = 16 a petition filed by the Pune-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) P= rayas to declare the power purchase agreement (PPA) between the Maharashtra=  State Electricity Board (MSEB) and Reliance Patalganga Power Ltd (RPPL) fo= r the 447-MW project as ""null and void.""  Prayas claimed that MSEB and RPPL=  had not sought prior approval for amending the PPA in February 2000 after = the establishment of Merc, and thereby have violated the Electricity Regula= tory Commission (ERC) Act, 1998, and also the Merc regulations.Through this=  amendment, the MSEB has agreed to provide escrow cover and certain other b= enefits to the Patalganga project. These amendments were made in view of th= e state government's decision to withdraw its permission granted for the th= ird party sale to the RPPL and accord escrow cover. Prayas has prayed that MSEB should seek Merc's approval before entering int= o or amending or approving any power purchase-related contract such as PPA,=  escrow agreement, fuel supply agreement and financing agreements with RPPL=  or any other generating company. Prayas said the Merc, as per section 22 o= f the ERC Act, 1998, is empowered and dutybound to regulate the power purch= ase and procurement process of the transmission and distribution utilities,=  including the price at which power shall be procured from the generating c= ompanies, stations or from other sources for transmission, sale, distributi= on and supply in the state.According to Praya, as per Merc Regulations 1999= , no. 73, any generating company proposing to enter into any agreement for = supply of electricity between the generating company and any buying party s= hall get the Merc approval for the tariff before entering into such contrac= t. ""From these provisions in the ERC Act, 1998, and Merc regulations, 1999,=  it is evident that no utility or generating company can amend the PPA with= out prior approval of Merc,"" Prayas opined. Prayas' petition deserves special importance, especially when the Madhav Go= dbole energy review committee has recently observed that neither the RPPL n= or the Ispat Group (promoter of the 1,082-MW Bhadravati project) would be a= ble to match the load requirements of Maharashtra, ""as both are structured = as base load plants, with high plant load factor."" The Godbole committee ha= d said that allowing RPPL and Ispat Group to proceed, ""would only result in=  a problem similar to DPC re-emerging in future years."" The committee has t= herefore recommended that MSEB should defer its PPAs with RPPL and Ispat Gr= oup and re-examine then in accordance with a least-cost plan, in any case, = till such time as the demand levels in the state permit full absorption of = power generated from such independent power producers (IPPs). The Godbole c= ommittee has observed that the MSEB needs to justify its projections in mor= e detail as to the type of demand, before proceeding further with these pro= jects.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- BUSINESS TODAY, Tuesday, May 15, 2001 Enron Switches Off CEO Sanjay Bhatnagar's exit could well be one more indication that the US m= ajor has gone cold on India.  Darkness at Noon Enron's India odyssey which started with the largest American FDI in India = is ending in a whimper. (Debojyoti Chatterjee)  That was back in 1996. Rebecca Mark was the face of US energy major Enron i= n India then. Her charm swayed India's industry and wowed its politicians-f= rom  reluctant union ministers to the Shiv Sena's firebrand  leader Bal Tha= ckeray. Mark managed to wrest the controversial Dabhol Power Project back f= rom the jaws of defeat. Enron then was on a roll in India. Five years later= , today, it could roll off the map. Two years after Mark's own fall from gr= ace at Enron's Houston headquarters, the US major seems to be winding down = its once-ambitious Indian operations. Suggest that to Enron's spokesperson = in Houston and the answer is a terse: ''No comment.'' But tap Enron  watche= rs and insiders and the picture becomes clearer. Enron's operations in Indi= a and in several other emerging markets seem to have become a major headach= e for the company. Want to know something else? These are the very projects=  that Mark was gung-ho about. Surprised?  Well, don't be. Not only is Enron miffed about its aggressive forays in eme= rging markets, most of which  were spearheaded by Mark, but it's also weedi= ng out  many of Mark's old faithfuls in the company. The most recent being = Sanjay Bhatnagar, the dapper former CEO of Enron India, who moved to head E= nron Broadband Services in Singapore as recently as in January 2001. Last f= ortnight, Bhatnagar quit the company. Just three months back, Bhatnagar's p= redecessor in India and an Executive Vice-President of Enron Corp, Joe Sutt= on, left the company. Sutton had played a key role in Enron's negotiations-= both with the Sharad Pawar government in Maharashtra and then with the Shiv=  Sena government. A quick recap: Enron's Dabhol project was first cleared b= y the Pawar government in 1993; then when the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance came t= o power, it rescinded the approval on the grounds that the tariff for Enron= 's power was too  high; finally, Enron mustered all its lobbying power and = got the project approved again. But controversy still dogs Enron and its Da= bhol project, the latest being the payments crisis involving Maharashtra St= ate Electricity Board (MSEB).  Today, Dabhol seems like a $1 billion disaster and Bhatnagar's successor Wa= de Kline is not deterred from taking a tough stance in his negotiations wit= h  the state government. Of course, some of that has to do with the fact th= at the current CEO of Enron, Jeffrey Skilling (who took over in 1999 from t= he high  profile Kenneth Lay, who is still the company's Chairman) wants to=  focus more on developed markets where the power sector is deregulated and = pegged to market forces. He is also credited with the huge success of Enron= 's Tyeside operations in the UK.  One of the first things Skilling did was to review Rebecca Mark's business = decisions, many of which were fuelled by her penchant for tapping the poten= tial of developing markets. The fact that two of her projects-in India and = in Croatia-backfired did not help. Two other forays led by Mark-in Kuwait a= nd the Phillipines-had also come unstuck in the mid-nineties. Eventually, M= ark moved out. Cut to India and things look rough. Recently, the outgoing U= S ambassador hinted that the Dabhol project, which is the single largest di= rect investment from the US in India, may turn out to be a huge disappointm= ent. And observers don't rule out the possibility of the Houston-based ener= gy major selling out or invoking penal clauses in its contractual agreement=  to exit what may have begun as a dream but has clearly ended up as a bad n= ightmare. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE WEEK, May 20, 2001 Gridlock  Dabhol Project: If Enron pulls out the costs will be heavy for Maharashtra = By Harish Rao and Nandkumar Pudhari  The endgame has begun. The decision of the foreign lenders to authorise bot= h Enron India's managing director, K. Wade Cline, and Dabhol  Power Company= 's (DPC) president and CEO, Neil Mcgregor, to issue termination notices, as=  and when appropriate, signals the first move in the decade-long power play= . But company Chairman Kenneth Lay has apparently vetoed the idea of withdr= awing from the project at least for now. Surprisingly, the government, whic= h should have been happy to see Enron's back, seems to be developing cold f= eet. A few politicians have gone on record saying that Enron's threatened p= ull-out will not be in the country's interest!=20  White elephant: Dabhol power plant  The project was jinxed from the very beginning. There was no way the countr= y could absorb 2,200 MW of base load in the current scenario. The projectio= ns about the demand were clearly wrong. Pushing ahead for the second phase = was another mistake. The demand for Phase-II may not emerge for another six=  to seven years. ""While Enron has used every clause to its advantage, we ha= ve not done so,"" said Kirit Parikh, professor emeritus, Indira Gandhi Insti= tute of Development Research.=20  Over the last one year, Enron's image has taken a global beating, with the = company being forced to  withdraw from Croatia, followed by its alleged inv= olvement in the California energy crisis. If Enron does ultimately pull out= , what is the liability of the state government? If merger and acquisition = and takeover rules are applied, Enron will have to be compensated for the p= roject cost as well as the discounted value of the future cash flow. It wil= l be a hefty sum that the state government can't afford. As for the salvage= able value of the project, the Enron Virodhi Andolan estimated the Dabhol P= roject's fair business value at Rs 350 crore. Enron's reported demand varie= s between Rs 1,800 and 2,800 crore. ""Dabhol is a failed business model,"" sa= id Pradyuman Kaul of the Andolan. ""The project cannot be valued on a going concern concept.""  Even if the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) takes over the proje= ct, running it will be a challenge, considering the high cost of operation.=  The already inflated Dabhol power project cost includes the LNG project co= st as well. DPC has set up a 5 million tonne LNG plant whereas the power pr= oject requires only 2.1 million tonnes. The Godbole committee recommended h= iving off the LNG project, so as to substantially reduce the cost of the po= wer project. Even if the project cost is brought down, the operating cost i= s already on the higher side.  According to Abhay Mehta, a crusader who has been following the Enron case,=  the cost of LNG quoted by the company is substantially higher than the pre= vailing market price. But it was also a fact that the price of LNG in the i= nternational market is manipulated by a handful of manufacturers and trader= s. This could have an adverse impact on the cost of power generated by the = company. Even if MSEB wants to transfer this plant to, say, the NationalThe= rmal Power Corporation, this factor alone may discourage the new buyers. In=  all this, what is the Central government's liability? Union Minister of St= ate for Power Jaywantiben Mehta had stated in the Rajya Sabha in March that=  the Central government had given a guarantee for making payments to the DP= C--if the MSEB and the state government fail to do so--in respect of capaci= ty and energy payments as well as payments upon termination in respect of P= hase-I (740 MW). However, this liability is subject to a ceiling of Rs 1,50= 0 crore in a financial year.  Won't Enron's exit spook other investors from coming to India? No, says Meh= ta. ""The Dabhol project is a symbol of inefficiency. By letting them operat= e, we are sending wrong signals to long-term investors. We are setting a ba= d precedent and forcing the foreign investors to believe that rules and law= s can be changed by managing politicians."" While Dabhol and Enron officials=  were unavailable for comment, opponents like Kaul suggest that Enron may l= ike to leave Dabhol with dignity and without trouble from the lenders. Enro= n, according to him, will be more than happy to dump the project in MSEB's = lap and salvage whatever amount they can get in the bargain.  Dabhol dilemma=20       Pros and cons of the Enron power project=20  Pros ?=09One of the few power projects that have been set up within the stipulat= ed time period.=20 ?=09Implementation of second phase is ahead of schedule.=20 ?=09Project involves the single largest foreign direct investment in the co= untry.=20 ?=09It is a multi-fuel integrated power plant with jetty and LNG regassific= ation terminal.=20 ?=09Equity participation by GE and Bechtel.  Cons ?=09Cost of the project is on the higher side. The cost of the construction=  of jetty and LNG terminal included in the total project cost, thus increas= ing the cost per =09MW, and, in turn, the power tariff.=20  ?=09Cost charged by Enron for LNG is higher than the prevailing internation= al price. Though LNG is considered to be one of the cleanest fuels, its pri= ce in the =09international market is manipulated by a cartel of LNG manufac= turers and traders.  ?=09All disputes are to be settled by the Arbitration Committee in London, = in accordance with English laws.=20  ?=09Maharashtra government ignored the contrary opinion given by the World = Bank on demand-supply      =09 projections.=20  ?=09Power tariff designated in dollars and subjected to rupee-dollar exchan= ge-rate fluctuations.  ?=09PPA structured in such a way that MSEB would be required to pay DPC Rs = 508 crore a month, without  even drawing a single unit of power from the pl= ant.     A peek into the past The project being set up by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) is promoted by t= he Enron Development Corporation (USA), which holds a 65 per cent stake. Th= e project envisages two phases of implementation, for establishing a total = capacity of 2,184 MW at Dabhol, on a build-own-operate basis (BOO). A Power=  Purchase Agreement (PPA) of a 20-year duration was also signed.=20  The first phase involving 695 MW was completed in 1999. The second phase is=  nearing completion. The project is based entirely on imported fuel. Phase-= I will use imported distillate oil. After the installation of Phase-II, the=  entire 2,015 MW capacity (now 2,184 MW) will be operated on imported LNG. = The Central Electricity Authority cleared it in 1999 on the basis of the ta= riff notification given by the state government and the MSEB that the power=  tariff was lower than that stated in the PPA. However, the Madhav Godbole = committee report stated that the payments made by MSEB were higher than tho= se mentioned in the PPA.  The Enron project is the first and only project in India based solely on im= ported LNG. The annual foreign exchange outgo at the 1997 rupee-dollar rate=  is estimated at $1.45 billion, which has a built-in potential for increase=  on account of escalation. The total cost of the project is over $2.85 bill= ion for both phases, of which $910 million relates to Phase-I. The arrangem= ent between DPC and MSEB involves a guaranteed purchase of power at 90 per = cent PLF (plant load factor) at rates calculated by a formula in the PPA, w= hich has built-in escalation provisions.=20  In addition, the Maharashtra government has guaranteed payment of dues unde= r the PPA by MSEB to DPC. This is also counter-guaranteed by the Central go= vernment. The choice of Enron for the project was made not by inviting publ= ic bids, but by private negotiations with a single party. Now, by the state=  government's own admission, Phase-I entails a monthly fixed charge of Rs 9= 5 crore. After the commissioning of Phase-II in 2001-02, MSEB will be requi= red to pay at least Rs 508 crore a month to Enron, without drawing even a s= ingle unit of electricity. And this will go on for 20 years.=20  This is the cost one has to pay for letting Enron invest in Maharashtra.
