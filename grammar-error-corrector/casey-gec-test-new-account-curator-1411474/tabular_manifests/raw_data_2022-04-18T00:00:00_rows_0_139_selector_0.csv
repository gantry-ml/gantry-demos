The one item that could cause problems is the reinforcing sleeve for the hot tap. It is supposed to ship 3/28 via hot shot directly to La Plata. We (construction and inspectors) will be contacting Steel Forgings periodically in the next couple of weeks to make sure they understand we cannot let that item slip.  The control valve should be received to be installed during the outage. I talked to Darrell Schoolcraft today and he is uncomfortable with flowing through the bypass with no control. I told him we would have SCADA to gas control prior to flowing. I spoke to the control valve vendor today and he indicated 2 - 3 weeks to shipment. I also talked to the La Plata team about initiating the work of getting a new point set up in SCADA. They are working on that and some communications issues with the Controls Specialist.  The meter tube should be received the week before the outage and we will have the opportunity to witness the tube / fitting inspection at the shop. That opportunity will be communicated to Red Cedar. This is another vendor we'll be maintaining close contact with.  My heads up to folks earlier in the week was intended to alert everyone that a major issue had come up and the outage dates could be in jeopardy. When I discovered that the Materials group hadn't ordered any pipe, valves, fittings, meter, etc., I felt that people needed to know.  We are back on track now to complete the installation 4/3 - 5 and be ready for service morning of 4/6.  Thanks Mike  ","Thanks Mike. Let me know what we can do to assist you with this.

2022-04-18 11:45:35+00:00,true,1,"  El Paso Tests Market for Mainline Expansion El Paso Natural Gas apparently got the message when its last open season for 1.2 Bcf/d of firm transportation capacity attracted bids for 14.4 Bcf/d. The pipeline has announced an open season to test market interest in a mainline expansion and to satisfy regulatory concerns that something needs to be done to relieve the apparent capacity constraint at the California border.  El Paso has been under significant pressure from regulators and shippers to expand because of enormous demand and skyrocketing prices in California. In a Jan. 3 letter to the pipeline, Daniel M. Adamson, director of FERC's Office of Energy Projects, urged El Paso to consider modifying its Line 2000 project to ""assist the difficult situation"" now facing the California gas market. Specifically, the Commission recommended El Paso amend a pending application in which it seeks to acquire an existing 30-inch diameter, 1,088-mile crude oil pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P., and convert part of it to natural gas transportation service. The line extends from McCamey, TX, to Bakersfield, CA. El Paso plans to convert to gas service a 785-mile segment from McCamey to Ehrenberg, AZ. El Paso proposed the Line 2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression, and not as a system expansion.  El Paso Vice President Al Clark told the commission that market demand for an expansion would have to be evaluated first. He said the open season for 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity being held by affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy would give the first indication whether such an expansion was needed.  Following such a resounding wake-up call, El Paso is holding a new open season to determine interest in additional capacity on the mainline or in relinquishing mainline space. The open season will end March 23.  El Paso officials said they will consider requests for firm transportation service originating in any receipt basin and delivered to any location on its system. If a new load can be matched to an existing shipper's offer of release or relinquishment, El Paso will attempt to facilitate the transfer of the capacity between the parties prior to proposing an expansion. Upon receipt of non-binding expressions of interest, they will begin to identify appropriate facilities to possibly expand the system.  Clark previously told FERC the pipeline could add compression to the proposed Line 2000 project or replace or recommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon. Another option, he said, would be to add new compression to the existing system or loop either the existing system or Line 2000 project. The economics of the project will determine the eventual form.  For more information on the open season visit El Paso's web site <http://tebb.epenergy.com/ebbEPG/ebbmain.asp?sPipelineCode=EPNG> or call Jerry W. Strange, director of transportation marketing, at (915) 496-3139.

2022-04-18 12:29:43+00:00,true,1,"  Gentlemen, In addition to looking for ways in which Transwestern can improve mainline deliverability, another important criteria is access to markets.  With the addition of the Calpine South Point project, we have delivery point capacity off the Topock Lateral approaching 1 Bcf/d.  However, we are currently limited to 400,000 Dth/d of capacity in the Topock Lateral itself.  Steve has asked us to look at what facilities/costs would be involved in increasing the deliverability of the Topock Lateral (no mainline capacity additions are implied, beyond the addition of Red Rock).  What would be the best/cheapest capacity additions we could make with respect to the Topock Lateral?  Drawing on my vast engineering expertise (ha,ha), it seems to me that with the directly connected power plant located approx. midway along the lateral line, wouldn't a compressor station immediately upstream of Calpine offer us the dual benefit of not only increased lateral capacity, but additional operating flexibility to meet the load curves for the plant?  Anyway, you guys are the experts, but we're asking that you look at a few cases and sketch out the associated costs of increasing the Topock Lateral capacity.  By way of suggested guidelines, I'd say that we'd like to see cases that provide for not less than 50 MMcf/d of incremental capacity, and not more than a doubling of the current line capacity (400 MMcf/d).  Again, its a cost/benefit sort of analysis, so we're really looking to key in on the cheapest, most economical capacity addition.  James, would you remain plugged in here, and given the information that Eric and/or Ben may provide, be prepared to give us some rate implications for this capacity addition?  Unless this creates too big a burden on your existing schedule of projects, can we set a deadline of March 30th with some Topock Lateral expansion cases along with costs/rates implications?  Please let me know.  If you need help with assumptions and/or need additional information, please give me a shout.  Thanks.","Gentlemen, In addition to looking for ways in which Transwestern can improve mainline deliverability, another important criteria is access to markets.

Following completion of the survey (next week) The reviewing agency has 30 days to make determination.  Regulatory has determined that the FERC submittal is to be delayed until receipt of determination.     ECS is preparing a proposal for electric compression at Station 1 to be delivered Tuesday 3/13.  This needs to be evaluated quickly if any interest exists.  This proposal should have a $5 mm decrease to project capital with increased operational flexibility.  FERC Project description will require amendment if interested.     Turbine Compressor selection evaluation is underway with proposals received from Rolls Royce and GE/NP.  Project Team and GSS will complete recommendation by 3/16/01     Project Environmental  has scheduled meetings with Air Permit agencies and expect no issues.  Permit is expected in a 5 - 7 month time frame.     Existing Noise Survey results have been received.  Recommendations for new facilities is being revised to accurately reflect Nearest Sensitive Receptor's (NSR) at individual stations.     Plot Plans and Scope of Work are being revised based on site visit.     c.  Change Requests and justifications are being prepared for review by marketing for items not in original Scope of Work.     Station Scrubbers were originally estimated to be revised in place for increased flow and efficiency.  The current scrubbers cannot be modified and will be evaluated for flow increase.  Based on projected increases in flow (future planned expansion), a scrubber upgrade now would alliaviate higher pressure drops and additions to scrubbers later.  It is recommended that a new high efficiency scrubber be considered for immediate installation based on increased efficiency and arrest of liquid migration due to increased flows.  Installation under separate workorder would allow tie-ins to the pipeline to be made at our conviencence without large effect on pipeline thruput for 3 days.  Resultant Station tie-in would result in a 2 day outage of the station vs 5 days currently scheduled.  Estimated cost is $1 MM     Electrical Generation was evaluated for capacity and reliability. Units at station are 40 years old and in need of renewal prior to increased loading due to gas cooler addition for new station.  Stations 1,2, and 4 will require augmentation to current electrical service.  Station 3 recent load test does not meet project reguirements.  Simplify tie-in to utilities and demarkation of old/new station facilities could be accomplished  by utilizing correctly sized new units.  This would become the weak link in reliable project operations should this not be approved.  Estimated cost is $1 MM.     Station recycle valves were requested by planning and Gas control to be added to the Scope of Work to increase flexibility.  Turbines have limited turndown.  The spare horsepower based on turbine selection limits turndown further.  Estimated cost is $1 MM.      2. OBJECTIVES FOR NEXT WEEK:  a. await TW Marketing evaluation of electrical compression option for station 1  b. Pre Award meeting with T/C vendor scheduled for bid and delivery clarification.    c. Recommend Turbine/Compressor vendor.  d. Submit Change Requests to Marketing for approval  e. Complete Engineering Scope of Work and solicit bids   3. OLD ISSUES:   none  4. Areas of Concern:  Station Overhead rates were originally evaluated as 11% in the original estimates.  Sebsequent evaluations by TW (Jim Saunders) changed the rate to 2%.  Additional correspondence indicates a 2 to 4% overhead rate is adequate.   Change Requests are being evaluated by the project team to make the ""best overall"" decision for the project and future operations.  Capital dollars are offset by tie-in downtime and simplicity.  Details of future expansion plans are required to evaluate impact to existing facilities and equipment selections.    ",1. ACTIVITIES: a.

2022-04-18 03:13:58+00:00,true,1,"  I've been provided a bootleg copy of the results of the El Paso open season.  Here's the most interesting thing... El Paso waived its right of first refusal under the one year deal done last year, and participated with everyone else in the open season.  Accordingly, they were allocated capacity along with everyone else.  Remember, all these deals were [supposedly] done at EPNG's max rates.  There were approx. 30 successful bidders, and their bids were for various term lengths.  Here are the more significant awards:  Burlington-  7,000 CEG Energy Options-  37,800 Coral-  15,000 Duke-  212,000 Dynegy- 56,500 El Paso Merchant- 277,000 ENA-  254,000 MGI Supply (Pemex)- 38,000 Oxy-  19,000 PG&E (et al.)- 151,000 SMUD-  10,000 Sempra Trading-  6,500 SoCal- 19,000 Texaco-  58,500 Williams- 11,500  Here's the other EPNG news flash... apparently, EPNG is telling shippers to be on the lookout for an announcement next week of another open season to guage shippers interest in a major expansion of its system.  I'm assuming at this point this project will include the All American pipeline asset.  I'm also now told that the Kern River expansion may be much larger than what we were led to believe a couple of weeks ago.  We heard earlier that they were looking at doing a 500 MMcf/d expansion that would include the 124 MMcf/d expansion already sold.  New information suggests that the 500 MMcf/d expansion may be significantly understated, and volumes may approach 700 - 800 MMcf/d.  The expansion would include not only compression, but would involve additional pipe, and would not be rolled into existing rates, but would be an incrementally priced project.","I've been provided a bootleg copy of the results of the El Paso open season.

The bottom line is that:  1.  The CEC significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this summer.  They estimate in their 5,000 MW supply deficit for the summer that expected outages will be around 3,000MW.  However, November and December saw significantly higher outage levels.  (7,265 MWs) The FERC has investigated these outages and found no improprieties- just that the plants are overtaxed from running at higher than normal capacities.  2.  There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1,244 MWs of projected supply from rerating/restarting existing thermal and renewable projects.  It is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer, if at all.  As evidenced by the e-mail I sent out this morning, local communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units.  In addition, these units are likely to be uneconomical.  3.  In the existing resource pool, there are roughly 1,430 MWs of peaking or other generation units that are running up against their operating hour limitations from air quality regulations.  The Governor has ordered the local air quality districts to address these restrictions,  We are beginning to seem some movement; however, the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed standards.  4.  The distributed generation/back-up generation capacity to make up some of the shortfall is still an unknown.  While there has been some relaxing of the limitations on run hours for back-up generation at ""essential public services"" the increase in DG is expected from ""clean"" sources, not diesel emergency generators.  5.  The CEC is doing everything it can to get 50+ MW peaking units on-line by this summer.  They are promising a 21-day permit application approval process and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets, for ""clean"" sources of generation in critical areas.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

2022-04-18 09:26:18+00:00,false,1,"  El Paso Merchant Declines ROFR Opportunity El Paso Merchant Energy, declining to match bids for about one-third of the capacity on its affiliate El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline into California, ""passed up a short-term profit"" (and more controversy) to focus on ""building our long-term relationship with our California customers,"" according to spokesman Mel Scott.  The Merchant Energy arm of El Paso, did, however, pick up 270 MMcf/d or 22% of the 1.22 Bcf/d awarded to 30 bidders earlier this week (see Daily GPI, Feb. 28 <d20010228f.html>). It was the largest slice, but not much above awards to three other large capacity winners.  ""We just decided we don't want to spend our energies dealing with the problems,"" that have plagued the company lately regarding use of the capacity by its affiliate, Scott said. ""We've been made a scapegoat. We're even getting calls from residentials. Their utilities have told them we're to blame for the high prices. We're delivering all the gas that California can take. We're not withholding capacity. There's no way you can hide capacity on a pipeline. But, you can't explain that to a California TV station. They just don't understand how the system works.""  Scott also pointed out that El Paso delivers about 3 Bcf/d out of the average 8 Bcf/d of natural gas that California uses. ""There are other pipelines, but they seem to focus on us.""  El Paso has not disclosed the total price to be paid under new contracts for the capacity, which is to start flowing June 1. The winning bids were at tariff rates for a minimum of five years, with El Paso Merchant Energy, Enron, Duke Energy and Pacific Gas & Electric collecting the largest shares. As the current holder of the capacity under a contract that expires May 31, El Paso Merchant had the right-of-first-refusal, which allowed it to match and pre-empt the winning bids, if it chose to do so. It did not and the ROFR period has now expired. Bids totaling 14.4 Bcf/d were received, making it necessary to prorate capacity.  Given the large volume of bids, El Paso also is considering expanding its pipeline and expects to hold an open season, although no date has been set, Scott said. The company also is considering FERC's suggestion that it expand its project to convert the existing 30-inch diameter, 1,088-mile crude oil pipeline it is acquiring from Plains All American Pipeline L.P. into new capacity for California In the meantime El Paso Energy is conducting an open season to determine interest for six prospective LNG terminals - at least one and possibly two of which would be on the West Coast. The company said it is prepared to spend $1.5 billion over the next five years on the projects (see Daily GPI, Feb. 6 <d20010206c.html>).

2022-04-18 06:03:27+00:00,true,1,"  El Paso Capacity Split Affiliates of El Paso Energy, Enron, Duke Energy and Pacific Gas & Electric appear to have picked up the largest shares of the 1.2 Bcf/d of available space on El Paso Natural Gas lines to Southern California points in the latest capacity auction.  The assignments posted on the El Paso EBB from 30 companies mostly run for five or six years from the June 1, 2001 start date, with a few extending even longer. An El Paso spokesperson would not confirm the posted bids represented the final allocation, but industry sources said they did not expect the current holder of the 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity, El Paso Merchant Energy, whose contract runs out May 31, to exercise its right of first refusal. El Paso spokespersons have been promising an announcement for two days.  It appears the winning bidders were taking no chances in going for the long term, since El Paso had said its economic evaluation of the bids would include returns up to five years. Rates paid were not disclosed, but sources were assuming, given current demand for capacity, they were at or near the maximum. The bids posted totaled 1,243,072 MMBtu/d and the leaders were (all volumes in MMBtu/d): El Paso Merchant Energy with 276,932, Enron Energy Services 254,056, Duke Energy affiliates 211,697, PG&E affiliates 151,300, Texaco Natural Gas 58,407, and Dynegy affiliates 56,418.  For El Paso Merchant Energy, Enron, Duke and PG&E, the bulk of their capacity is for deliveries to PG&E at Topock. Other prospective capacity holders include MGI Supply Ltd., CEG Energy Options, Sempra Energy affiliates, Occidental Energy, Merrill Lynch Capital, Coral Energy, Mexicana del Cobre, AEP Energy Services, Allegheny Energy Supply, Williams Energy, Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Burlington Resources, Paramount Petroleum, California Steel Industries, and others.  Coming in the wake of the capacity squeeze going into California over the last year, the latest allocation was a far cry from the two previous auctions for about a third of El Paso's capacity relinquished by Pacific Gas & Electric in December 1997. Dynegy (then NGC) paid $70 million for the space for 1998 and 1999. The payment included about a 12-cent/Dth reservation charge, plus about 1.6-cent usage charge (see Daily GPI, Jan. 7, 1998 <d980107c.htm>). After that a contract with Enron for the space fell through and El Paso Merchant Energy picked up the capacity in January 2000 for 15 months for $38.5 million (see Daily GPI, Feb. 17, 2000 <d20000217e.html>).  Management of the space has been under attack by California regulators and shippers since the first contract was awarded to NGC. El Paso and high-flying California border prices currently are among the targets of several investigations on-going in California and Washington. The company recently issued a press release labeling as ""demonstrably untrue"" allegations that capacity was manipulated to increase prices (see Daily GPI, Feb. 26 <d20010226g.html>).

I have visited with Kevin about looking at our quality issues (H2s and H2o) with Agave and coming up with an agreement on how much they will be allowed to give us. They way it stands now is they can't give us anymore than we were giving ourselves before the system was sold to Agave. The big problem is the difference in volumes from then until now. Kevin whatever I can do to help resolve this let me know. Thanks for everyone's help. Rich    Mike McCracken 02/22/2001 02:41 PM   To: Earl Chanley/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Mansoor Abdmoulaie/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Eric Faucheaux/ET&S/Enron@Enron cc: Rich Jolly/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Arnie Bailey/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Team Artesia/ET&S/Enron@ENRON   Subject: Agave & Atoka System  Earl / Mansoor As communicated earlier, I met with Ed Perry with Agave today. We looked at the Atoka 3 piping drawings and discussed some possibilities for connecting their 12"" coming into Atoka 3 (our old 12"" Atoka Loop) to the discharge side of the station. We decided to make a quick site visit with the team for possible issues.  Drawing A3-A11-19 shows a capped tee on the 12"" just downstream of the receiver line tie-in. We talked about connecting to that tee, going underground to the west, coming above ground and running south along the fence, placing some valves for scrubber installation, and turning toward the east for tie-in to the existing 8"" meter run. The upstream of the meter run (upstream of the existing shut-in valve) would need to be manifolded to allow flow from the 12"" or commoning like it is now. There is a relief valve existing at the 8"" meter run inlet, it can remain on either high or low pressure service. An additional relief valve would be needed for the other stream.  Drawing A3-A11-19A shows the meter run area. The downstream meter run piping would need a tee in place of the 90 under the meter run flange. One side of the tee would go the existing valve to the suction side of the station. The other side of the tee would go a new valve and line running to the discharge side of the station. That line would go west from the meter run outlet to the fence, turn north and follow the fence to a point adjacent to an 8"" valve on drawing A3-A11-5. At the 8"" valve, the line shown as ""8"" line from meter runs"" would be cut and capped. The new line would flange to the valve. With the valve open, gas would flow through the ""8"" Crossover"" to the tie-in on the 8"" Atoka Lateral.  We went to the site and all piping can be above ground per Terry Youngren except the initial take off from the 12"" tee. That would need to stay underground to the fence area to permit vehicle traffic. The piping in paragraph 2 would actually be Agave's up to the upstream flange at the new valve at the meter run. All the downstream piping would be Transwestern's. Additionally, Agave has said they would place a scrubber on order and expected a 12 -16 week delivery.  Measurement and quality issues brought up by Terry: Existing 8"" meter run is secondary tube, so no quality equipment exists It does have an operator on upstream valve for shut-in It does have full transmitters - differential, pressure, temperature Need additional H2S monitor for high pressure stream. Looked at 2 stream Sulphur Smart, physically too large for building. Need H2O monitor for high pressure stream. Kahn or Meeco, Terry is checking on a new type monitor. Need 2 stream Danalyzer. Existing Chromatograph is single stream. The single could be used at new Aid St. if it is ever separated to West Texas. Need new 1/8"" sample line with shut-in solenoid for 8"" run. Need new sample probe regulator for 8"" run. Look at A+ Corp, they have one that includes a membrane filter in the probe.  I have some drawings that are put together. Maybe we could get together Monday morning and hopefully explain a little better.  Finally, I committed nothing to Ed. I explained that his next steps would be for Agave to contact their marketing person and let them run the project through the proper channels for estimates and evaluations. I explained that the scenarios he presented of placing however many mmcf on the discharge side, reducing the low pressure (existing Atoka 3 suction) volume and using horsepower to reduce suction pressure, and possibly placing 2 units on LEC 10"" service to allow entire Duke and Yates Sulphur Plant gas on that line would have to have someone's blessing besides mine. I also explained that some modeling would probably need to be done to check expected results. Issues like isolating 8"" Atoka Lateral from the 12"" to allow high pressure receipt to bypass dehy at Atoka 1 and still be compressed by Atoka 1 (possible and brought up by Terry), isolating 8"" from 12"" and bypassing Atoka 1 completely (brought up by Ed Perry) with enough pressure were noted and I said I would pass them along.

2022-04-18 20:33:47+00:00,true,1,"  I fielded a call today from Mr. Rob Cooper of U.S. Gypsum.  Mr. Cooper indicated that he's been in contact with Lorraine for purposes of acquiring Red Rock expansion capacity.  Moreover, Mr. Cooper has been in contact with SoCal Gas in order that SoCal Gas recognize firm deliveries from Transwestern at Needles in excess of the current (sustainable) limit of 750 MMcf/d.   Mr. Cooper insists that he is making progress with SoCal Gas aimed at lifting the 750 window to 760, and that SoCal Gas has indicated U.S. Gypsum would be entitled to an exclusive right to the increased amount.   While trying not to be argumentative, I told Mr. Cooper that if SoCal Gas was willing to set aside a discrete increment of capacity for a single shipper, it would be a radical departure from current SoCal Gas policy.  Currently, SoCal Gas does not provide unbundled intrastate transmission.  They have only accepted or not accepted pipeline nominations, as the case may be, as an aggregate volume, with no distinction being drawn on who the upstream shippers were.  I set about to try to explain that there is no correlation (other than coincidental timing) between (1) TW discussions with SoCal Gas at raising the capacity window at Needles and (2) TW's effort to sell Red Rock Expansion space.  In addition, I attempted to explain that TW feels it will be required to follow certain rules pursuant to its tariff and FERC policy associated with making new delivery point capacity available on a non-discriminatory basis.  With respect to this issue, I told Mr. Cooper that, although we're currently discussing it, we'd yet to come to any decision on how, if incremental capacity does become available at Needles, TW would make such delivery point capacity available to its shippers.    Mr. Cooper then proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how, if that's the case, then ""he's wasted 3 weeks in active negotiations"" with both SoCal Gas and TW aimed at securing capacity at Needles.  He said on several occasions that ""end game"" for him was to secure a firm portal from the interstate system onto and through the SoCal Gas system.  Mr. Cooper also expressed a concern that if he's forced into a competitive bidding situation with other big marketing companies (in his words, ""such as ENA"") for Needles capacity, then he probably couldn't compete, and once again, would be left on the outside looking in.  He pointed to the El Paso Merchant deal on EPNG as a prime example.    Mr. Cooper said he wasn't ready to accept my explanation as to why TW couldn't commit to offering U.S. Gypsum an exclusive right to any incremental Needles capacity, and asked that I formally ""run it up the flagpole"" to senior management and get back with him by telephone with TW's ""official position.""   As an editorial comment, I'm not sure Mr. Cooper completely understands (or cares about) the landscape here.  I'd go so far as to say that from his style and the tone of his conversation with me, he won't easily take ""no"" or even a ""maybe"" as an answer.   The difficulty for TW is going to be in trying to persuade him that we're interested in his business and sympathize with his position, but that we face real legal and/or regulatory issues here, and they cannot be dismissed or ignored by U.S. Gypsum or any other customer.  I'd like to be in a position to call him back on Friday and give him TW's ""official position"" on his request for Needles service in the Red Rock expansion.  Thoughts?  Suggestions?  Help?","I fielded a call today from Mr. Rob Cooper of U.S. Gypsum. Mr. Cooper stated that he's been in contact with Lorraine for purposes of acquiring Red Rock expansion capacity.

We can all thank Clinton for any  overdone media coverage on future presidents.   B. Why is GW deserving of so much military respect? He has not exactly been a  paragon of clean living.  Also, he got into the ""champagne unit"" of the National Guard ahead of  hundreds of other more qualified people, according to time on the wait list, and extrance exams.  GW is trying to set a new ""tone"" in DC, which, I for one, respect.  Something  had to be done after the negative Clinton years.  Yes, he may have done some  good for the country, but he did not do anything to earn the respect he may  have gotten, which I hope was little.

2022-04-18 16:04:01+00:00,true,2,"  Daniel,   I do remember working on an assignment agreement regarding the assignment of  the Columbia Energy contracts with MSCGI  to Enron North America Corp.  I  will need to find the document.  It is my understanding that, with the exception of one deal, all the deals  between ENA and MSCGI are firm deals of greater than one month duration.  ENA  uses the GISB for month or less firm deals and interruptible deals of any  length as recommended by the Gas Industry Standards Board.  For firm deals  that are longer than one month, ENA uses a master firm agreement if one  exists.  If there is no master firm agreement, we send out our General Terms  and Conditions with our confirmation.  That answers your question of why  Ellen sent our GTC when there is a GISB in place.  It appears to me that you and I need to work on getting a master firm  agreement in place.  Please let me know your thoughts.

It is hard for me to remain professional with him  as his arrogance and illogic is very frustrating, but our discussion was very  cordial.  He indicated that Enron has not brought forth any proposal of  substance.  This apprarently means we have not offered them energy at below  market prices.  I indicated that should he find some of that energy in the  ""$50 - $60"" range to give me a call as we would be willing to buy in the ""70s  and the 80s.""  I was not able to learn when he would be in the market to buy,  but I encouraged him to give me a call if he wanted a price quote.  I don't  have much confidence that he would call even if he was buying.  I will leave  it up to him to call rather than make this a priority to chase as the  opportunities with PD seem to be limited.  If they do need energy I expect  they will keep the term short and shop it pretty hard.  There mining  operation plans seem tenuous and they think prices are going to fall.  With  APS and Salt River out there in the shorter duration markets we wouldn't make  much money anyway.

2022-04-18 12:53:04+00:00,true,3,"  Kim and Barry -  I had a couple of thoughts with respect to our meeting yesterday on  municipals.  It appears to me that with the California municipals especially,  accellerating the entire sales process will be critical.  I'm thinking about  how we can get in place as much of the required paper as possible prior to  negotiating deal terms.  Much of the required documentation (proof of  authority to transact, outside legal opinion, etc.) will be difficult to push  until you are actually negotiating with these counterparties, as there won't  be any incentive on their part to drive these issues.  However, from our end,  we can prepare all of the required contracts prior to any meetings with these  counterparties so that we don't lose any time on that front.  With that in mind, do you have a list of target counterparties that you will  be attacking in the near term?  If so, please forward to me and I will begin  the process of reviewing from a credit standpoint and putting together draft  Master contracts to put in front of the counterparties.

2022-04-18 15:56:43+00:00,true,4,"  Phil,  Yesterday we had our call to nominate the April LNG ship delivery.  We decided to nominate our five day window between April 4 thru 8.  PREPA is  forecasting a 75% dispatch thru that period.  If the dispatch is 75%, we  forecast that we would be running out of LNG about on the 8th.  Typically, we  nominate with a few days cushion against the late delivery date.  We decided  not to have a few days cushion for  the following reasons:  1. We avoid a cash flow shortfall of between $1-5 million (depending on the  ship size) prior to April 16, 2001.  2. Inventory projections are based on 100% power plant availability.  3. Based on lastest loading schedules, Cabot is expected to respond with  April4-6 delivery window.  4. There is sufficient LPG available to cover several days of LPG operation.  5. In the event that PREPA dispatches higher than 76% (and exposes themselves  to SFP), volumes that we have made available to PREPA are priced at  $6.75/mmBtu, which should cover our LPG costs.  Additionally, the volumes  made available would only allow dispatch at about 87%.  We are prepared, if  necessary, to significantly increase the price of any additional volumes made  available to discourage dispatch above 87%.  Although our nomination should take care of a cash flow shortfall in April,  we will have a problem in May (prior to May 17, 2001) unless we receive  insurance money.  If we have a problem in May, it is not clear to me that we  will be able to draw on the DSR as debt service payments are due only in  March, June, September, and December.  Our insurance strategy must now include getting at least a partial payment in  April.  Jaime please undate the cash flow (we will need this to address the  Lenders recent request for an update) and advise us of our options assuming  we will have a cash flow shortfall in May.

Ron says that arrival pressure has not caused any delays at CMS so far, and  that he does not expect us to have a problem or any delays even at as high as  1160.  I would suggest we give orders to arrive no higher than 1160 to  minimize boil-off, please let me know if this is acceptable and I will pass  it on to the ship.  On the heel, we are not planning on making the decision until a few days  before discharge so that we have the latest information on possible delays as  well as bunker prices and such.

Approach velocity metering is currently hand held and portable and will   remain so. ?No permanent equipment is planned for installation. ?The purpose   of the equipment is to measure the ship's approach velocity as it is nearing   the mooring position. ?The velocity should not exceed 6 inches per second as   it contacts the breasting dolphins. ?If the ship were to impact the dock at  a   greater velocity, then a subsequent inspection should be performed to   ascertain whether or not damage to pier pilings had occurred.   The metered mooring hooks have been recommended but not specified nor   procured. ?The metered hooks would allow close monitoring of ship's forces  on   the dock during unloading and the data would allow for the ship to adjust   forces on the dock, and this controlling the ship's position, by precise   application/use of ballast and intermediate adjustment of mooring lines.  This   feature, by providing precise information on the forces (and motion) of the   ship relative to the dock would allow for greater precision in positioning  of   the ship at the optimum vertical and horizontal position relative to the   unloading arms and avoidance of undue forces on the unloading arms.

2022-04-18 09:31:02+00:00,true,5,"   John, Rod may have been thinking of a different scenario than what I have been pursuing.  The scenario currently on the table has two possibilities: Case A:  EAMR engineers, procures and constructs (EPC) the interconnect and/or measurement facilities for the customer.  The customer then holds title to the facilities and EAMR operates the facilities for them under a long term contract.  When the contract is terminated, the facilities are conveyed to either EAMR or the pipeline at a much smaller value (current market value for the used facilities at that point in the future).    Case B:  EAMR does EPC, owns and operates the facilities and then contracts with the customer for a long term interconnect service fee (possibly in cents/MMBtu or a lump sum dollar amount monthly) to recover the capital with a good return and operating costs plus a margin.  Robert Guthrie of the Tax Department has indicated that he believes these mechanisms will work.  EAMR would not be required to add a tax gross up for the contribution in aid of construction (CAC) because neither of the deals are structured with a CAC.  EAMR would only have to pay income tax on the profit made on either Case A or Case B annually.  More work needs to be done to work through these scenarios to see if they are completely feasible.  Since Case B involves capital and is much more complex, I have been concentrating on Case A and saving B for the future.    Michelle Lokay has been working with Pogo Producing on a new interconnect to TW and we are using that interconnect as an example to see if there are expanded services that can be offered.

That can be done with or without an EAMR in the mix (except for the construction) and actually get us a benefit  in a future rate case as whatever is left of the value at that point in time becomes rate based.

2022-04-18 03:09:07+00:00,true,6,"   Dear Harry and Dave,   I wanted to summarize where we are currently at in relation to the Automated Confirms project and to pass on our preliminary findings from our analysis. Bear with me this is a long email.  We completed a very high-level analysis of the value we believe would be created for Enron, Enron's trading partners, and a Systems Integrator. We based our model on the architecture you have currently proposed.  The value created for Enron Online will be significant based on value associated with increasing the volume of trades on Enron Online and driving additional liquidity into the market. We also included, in the Enron value calculation, revenue for providing the service to trading partners. We believe additional value will also be created by offering other products through this channel but we did not estimate this.  By leveraging some in-depth analysis we did based on other markets (not power and gas) the value to Enron's largest trading partners for doing automated confirms is not quite as compelling as it might appear on the surface. Our high-level estimates put the value at around $800 thousand per year on average. This is made up of reduced risk from incorrectly marked deals, more accurate position reporting, and efficiencies in the mid and back office personnel. Based on your current model it would cost a trading company $200-$500 thousand dollars to set up the service plus ongoing transaction fees or subscriptions. This service might not be as easy to sell as we initially thought.   Based on your proposed architecture, the system integrator revenue would be $200K - $400K per installation for somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 - 20 major trading partners. Assuming an average of $300K for 15 sites the total services fees would be a total of $4.5 million without including any additional fees from ongoing transactions.   This back of the envelope analysis is based on a lot of assumptions and some past work we did for other markets including other energy commodities such as crude. I'm sharing this in the spirit of openness and invite you to challenge us on any glaring flaws you see as we are not claiming that this is a perfect analysis or that we went to a great level of detail. However, some suggestions we have based on this are as follows: You must make this as easy and inexpensive as possible to get organizations connected, possibly viewing this as a loss leader. This is because the largest value is created for Enron through increased transaction throughput not from charging for the service. Alternatively, you might think of adding additional services from day one to increase the value to the trading companies and get them to sign up more rapidly. You may want to consider co-operating with other online / offline services to increase number of automated confirms so that trading companies can take greater advantage of the Enron service.  You should take another look at the architecture and give consideration to how you could more easily get companies online, possibly without the need for large integration fees or additional hardware. Once people are online it would be easier to sell a more robust solution that would involve actually putting a server on their premise.    You might want to consider some type of market assessment of the trading partners to determine exactly what they would like but more importantly what they would be willing to pay for. This could dramatically alter your go-to-market strategy.  As I shared with Dave, at this point without further analysis or a change to the proposed model, we (Ed, Milind, and I) would never be able to get Sapient to agree to  a significant cash investment in the partnership. What we would propose could take the form of ""sweat equity"" on the part of Sapient to train a team on the API's and feet on the street to go and talk to trading companies about the opportunity.  We also could offer to do a co-funded (Sapient and Enron) market assessment to take a two to four weeks to flush out the business model and analyze what trading companies would be willing to pay for in the way of additional products and services. We do believe that if you completed the assessment you would be better able to strengthen your go-to-market strategy.  Keep in mind that we are sharing these thoughts because we do want to develop a relationship and just as importantly want your team to be successful in this venture even if that means there is not a role for Sapient. Also if someone is telling you something that is contrary to our findings based on their analysis please give me a call because I definitely want to understand if we are fundamentally missing something.    I will follow-up with each of you over the next week to see how you are progressing. Please call or email me with any thoughts or reactions.  Sincerely,   Lee Henderson  Director, Energy Services  (713) 402 - 1618  ","Dear Harry and Dave, I want to summarize where we are currently at in relation to the Automated Confirms project and to pass on our preliminary findings from our analysis.
