It‚Äôs both my greatest joy and the hardest work I do. When we first started Finfolk, Bryn was the sculptor and I was the painter, and we‚Äôve kept those respective titles (while gaining about a dozen more each) over the last nine years. Since 2012, almost everything that‚Äôs come out of Finfolk has been hand painted by me, with the exception of some occasional assistant work.   The physical labor of painting is where the true ‚Äúwork‚Äù of painting lies. First the gear- mask, goggles, gloves, a full paint suit, and a loud compressor. Then my physical surroundings- the hard concrete pad of my painting deck, and whatever weather conditions or temperatures we may be experiencing on a paint day. I wear ice packs in anything above 80¬∞ and generally try to avoid painting in anything below 40¬∞, because the cold metal from the paint gun will cause my hands to go numb. There are days where my back and shoulders ache from bending over tables, and other days where my hips and knees ache from spending hours standing mostly stationary. (And more and more days lately when it‚Äôs both.)  But there are also many moments - blissful and transportive ones, where painting becomes meditative. A release from the stress of ‚Äúupstairs,‚Äù and into an easy rhythm of creative flow. I often joke that there are some flukes I could paint with my eyes closed, because of how often I‚Äôve painted them. But there‚Äôs almost a comfort in the muscle memory of each paint stroke. It‚Äôs as much a part of me as I am of it. üñ§‚Äù","Repost from @abby.of.finfolk  ‚ÄúWorking through the last of the custom Mythics on my to-do list and loving the teal and bronze color palette for this one.

This ties perfectly with the work our tree planting partner does!   @edenprojects : ""There are a couple more factors that influence what types of trees will grow that we do not control. At many of our sites, there is a small percentage of trees that we did not plant. This happens because as our trees grow into an emerging forest, wildlife that once thrived in the area returns. These animals carry seeds on them or in their digestive system and release them into the reforested area. The dispersed seeds begin to sprout and grow alongside our restored forest. We also discovered that many of the planting areas contain dormant seeds or root systems in the soil. As our planted trees grow and wildlife returns, these seeds and root systems become active and start to grow.""  Planting trees assists in the return of wildlife! Amazing!

2022-04-24 17:25:19+00:00,true,3,"        BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  Enron Freight Markets Despite an eroding economy and increasing scrutiny of Enron, Enron Freight Markets finished a record month in October, completing more than 4,000 transactions (50% growth from September) and adding over 200 new counterparties.  Volumes were especially strong in the last 10 days of the month.  One of the big sources of transaction growth was increased volume from other major freight intermediaries, substantially bolstering EFM's efforts to develop a wholesale market.  Enron Global Markets Coal  Increased liquidity in the prompt months has brought more players into the spot rail market. Traditionally a thin market in the OTC market, the coal group is capitalizing on increased interest by introducing several new EOL rail products. On the CSX rail line, there will be two 12,500 btu products with different sulfur contents - 1.2 pound (or compliance) and 1.6 pound. The CSX contract will be FOB rail in the Big Sandy or Kanawha rail districts. On the Norfolk Southern rail line, there will be two similar 12,500 btu products, however, FOB rail in the Thacker or Kenova rail districts. The coal group intends to bring these products on line within a week for the cash book, and hopefully extend them to the forward markets.  Enron Industrial Markets Lumber Enron's Lumber Trading Group recorded a record 33 transactions on Clickpaper.com for the week ended November 11, 2001 for a gross notional value of approximately $1,200,000. This compares to the group's prior weekly average of 5 online transactions with a notional value of approximately $140,000.  The increase in activity is due to the launch of the Lumber Group's New Futures-Like Fixed Price Forward Contracts, which began trading last week.  ""We are very excited about the overwhelming market acceptance of our new Forward Contracts which we expect will revolutionize the way lumber is traded"" says John Jacobsen, a manager with EIM's Lumber Trading Group.  We expect to see continued increases in our online trading activity as we start actively marketing them. What makes this week's activity even more promising is the fact that the cash market has been fairly quiet due to the uncertainty surrounding a softwood lumber dispute between the US and Canada.""

Enter ""Skytel pagers"" as the Quick Search text. Tip:  All users must select a service plan in addition to the pager.  Handheld Devices:   EWS eProcurement users should go to the catalog under IT Hardware. Enter ""Blackberry"" as the Quick Search text.  Tip: No need to select a separate service plan. A service plan is combined in the catalog with each handheld device.  Information Required When Ordering SkyTel Items Pagers and Handheld Devices:  The user's EID* and name are required for all SkyTel items. After adding the item(s) to the Shopping Cart, the requester must click the Line Item Details icon (magnifying glass) and enter the user's EID and name under the Purchase Order Text tab. The order cannot be processed without this information. This will ensure that the ongoing monthly service plan charges are assigned correctly to the user's cost center. *If EID is unknown, users should go to eHRonline to view their EIDs.  Tip: If you wish to swap out a pager for a handheld device, make sure to include your existing pager phone number in the PO Text.   NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH  Update on Enron Europe  Following on from last week's memo on the health of the business, here's a snapshot of the activities we are pursuing currently to provide customers and investors with confidence in our business:  We are continuing to work on trading liquidity, which to date is going well.  We are transacting with most of our counterparties, but we are spending a significant amount of commercial and commercial support time working on putting credit agreements in place.  These credit agreements tend to focus on netting out exposures between different Enron business units (for example UK gas and UK power) and providing collateral arrangements whereby neither one of us can owe more than a pre-agreed amount without starting to ""pay as you go"".  During these tough times, our priorities right now are to:         - Preserve cash (as our credit rating has been downgraded, our ability to keep maximum cash liquidity is critical).        - Insure that we are getting paid when we should get paid.  In other words, we are focusing efforts on accounts receivable that should have been paid and are now  overdue (something that is always important, but even more so now).  - Reduce our expenses to the greatest extent possible.  - Keep making money.  So please let us know how we can help you help us get the job done.  Remember, the key thing for Enron at present is that we put all our efforts into making money, keeping costs down and ensuring that all cash due to us is collected on time.  Focusing on the business at hand will be critical to helping us demonstrate our overall strength.  Enron Nordic Energy Restructuring Enron Nordic Energy last week took steps to restructure its operations with respect to Finland.  Moving forward, Enron Nordic Energy will continue to service the Finnish market from its Oslo office, offering a range of products including portfolio and risk management services.  This move is not indicative of a withdrawal of Enron's business from the Finnish market, but rather has been initiated in an effort to rationalise Enron's functions and services in the region.    Enron Succeeds in Completing its First Bi-Lateral Power Transaction Inside Italy  Congratulations are due to the Italian desk for concluding its first power transaction inside Italy.  The team succeeding in buying 5MW of peak energy for December 2001 from Italian wholesaler, Energ.it, and are selling it to Enel Trade, the trading arm of the incumbent energy company, ENEL.  Energ.it is mainly active in Sardinia and off-takes power from the AES plant in Ottana, Sardinia.  ""Although this is only a small deal it demonstrates the market's appetite to transact."" says Daniela Uguccioni, Enron's Italian power trader.  ""Due to the slow progress of liberalisation in Italy, we are still limited to doing back-to-back transactions such as this, however this is definitely a step in the right direction"" adds Paul Mead, Director of Regional Power Trading.  ""The exciting part of this deal is that ENEL will now trade with us inside Italy, something we have been trying to do with them for years.""  New Online Metals Product Last week saw the launch by Enron Metals of online 'averaging' contracts for Copper and Aluminium.  'Fixed for Float' and 'Month on Month' averaging contracts are now available for the 'nearby months' (i.e.up to three months ahead) providing a useful tool for hedgers.  The introduction of this product online, which is of particular interest for producers and consumers, came in response to customer demand.  The initial response has been positive as last week saw the first trades and we are already seeing requests for the product to be made available for other metals.  Polish Power Market Gathers Momentum as Enron Signs Second Master Trading Agreement Enron Poland, which recently closed its first-ever OTC transaction with Poland's largest generator PKE, has signed a second Master Trading Agreement with one of the top ten regional distribution companies, Energa Gdansk.  The agreement will provide the basis for future bi-lateral electricity transactions.  ""We hope to close our first deal with Gdansk in Q4"", says Jarek Dybowski, Enron's director of power trading in Poland.   BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS FROM DOWN UNDER Power Desk Sees Promising Market Growth In the energy market, Enron Australia continues to build its presence year-on-year.  Enron Australia's results at the end of the third quarter showed a 50% increase in volumes, an 80% increase in transactions, and a 300% increase in P&L.  The advent of a competitive ancillary services market in Q4 provides scope for increasing the power team's activity further by the end of the year.  Pacific Solar REC Trade Enron Australia has secured a renewable energy deal with Pacific Solar, a company that is developing solar photovoltaic systems for the rooftops of the world. The transaction gives Enron the right to purchase all of the renewable energy certificates (RECs) generated by the PV units sold in Australia. Pacific Solar is also selling its systems in Europe though Italian company, Eurosolare. The deal is the first exclusive offtake agreement Enron has secured in the nascent Australian REC market.

Sustainability, zero food waste and respect for our Mother Earth.   Our philosophy at Terra is based on maximising all ingredients and reusing all leftovers until only fibres or non-edible parts are donate to our compost.   Back in May 2020, we become a zero food waste restaurant.  This dish - the garfish tail - become the icon for our concept.   We got a garfish from sustainable fishing in the Nordic sea, and we use every single part of it. As the nose to tail concept. We decided to be a bit provocative and to raise awareness to our guests. Therefore we served the tail, as our Italian roots and grandpa thought us, is the most delicious part of it. A roasted tail, glazed with homemade tamari and served with a broth of garfish (made from the fish bones and heads). The filet is served as an other dish in the tasting menu. Once again provoking to show that you can serve the same ingredient in the same menu. Without being boring. On the contrary, serving with different flavours and textures.  That is our zero food waste approach. And what sustainability is for us. Reusing and transforming in a creative way every single ingredient until only non edible parts are donates to our compost for our kitchen garden.  Let‚Äôs be the change we wanna become.   Since September 2021, we have been awarded as green Michelin star restaurant by the @michelinguide üçÄ  T√®rra | zero food waste minimal, sustainable & innovative  A green star in the Michelin guide.  @_terrarestaurant_  Chef @valerio_serino   A project by @valerio_serino & @__lucy_in_the_sky__   #_terrarestaurant_ #_terraproject_ #sustainable #michelinguide  #greenrestaurant #zerowaste #adgitaly #valerioserino #zerofoodwaste #michelingreenstar #flwday #flwday2021","International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste 2021 We celebrate today what we celebrate every day.

Rub pork with salt and pepper and place in a pressure cooker. 4. Pour the marinade over pork. Add 2 cups of water‚ÄîCook for 45 minutes from the start of the whistling sound. 5. Prepare the pickled onions and the sauce while the meat is cooking. Cut thin pieces of red onion and put them in a mixture of water, vinegar, and oregano. 6. For the sauce, season cajun peppers with mustard, salt, and pepper on a frying pan with a small amount of olive oil. Grind the seasoned peppers and add orange juice to the mix. 7. Once the meat is ready, shred it and return to the pressure cooker with the cooking juices. 8. In a hot pan, place shredded cheese until it browns and a rigid shell forms. 9. Remove the shredded meat from the cooker and put it in a tray. 10. Form the cheese in the shape of a taco and place the shredded pork in it.  #yum #eat #foodpic #dinner #foodpics #lunch #dinner #foodphotography #foodlover #tasty #hungry #foodblogger #healthyfood #foods #cooking #eeeeeats #TasteOfHome #StellaArtois","‚ÄúMy grandmother used to say that when you cook for someone, you share something more than flavors.

Heat the PX with the loose leaf tea for 5 minutes on medium-low heat. Allow it to cool down. Place the infusion in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Double strain the mixture. Add 5 ml of active charcoal to the mixture, shake it and bottle it.  Coffee and coconut-infused aromatic bitters: Place 6 oz of medium-body coffee beans inside a 10 oz mason jar. Pour 8 oz of aromatic bitters and 2 oz of organic coconut extract. Seal it and shake it really hard. Let it sit for 24 hours and shake the mixture a few times during that period.  Garnish: To preserve the integrity of the banana leaf garnish, apply raw honey in the area that was attached to the plant and then put it in iced water, submerging only the same part where the honey was applied.

We had never heard of a Garbage Plate, but it turns out that it‚Äôs a dish native to Rochester, NY. It‚Äôs got a long history there and is still popular today, with lots of variations. The name is actually even trademarked to a specific Rochester restaurant, so we‚Äôre calling our version ‚ÄúTHE PLATE WITH NO NAME‚Äù‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs our new Blue Plate Special. Thank you @unrealjo!  Our version of this combo includes a base of home fries and mac & cheese (vegan or vegetarian), topped with a Beyond Meat cheeseburger patty (cheddar or Violife vegan cheddar), our house chili, chopped onions and a drizzle of yellow mustard. Available through 1/26. Takeout & delivery only right now (no dine-in). üì∏: @marciocaxoeiro","A while back @unrealjo messaged us and suggested that we do a Veggie Galaxy version of a ‚ÄúGarbage Plate‚Äù as a Blue Plate Special.
