2022-04-08 04:38:48+00:00,true,1,"  Rick:  Thanks for the note to David.  It had the desired impact as David walked  around first thing and was very appreciative.  As I said before, this is the  right message in this situation based on the actions taken by David which now  tend to get a bit lost in the current noise (ie. exposure having now  increased to $ 18 MM).   Relative to the M-to-M, David had questioned both Beasley and Sweeney (Comm.  Suppt.) about the M-to-M starting well before the September pre-pay of 2.8 to  Vnesh.  Beasley said the prudency would cover the exposure while Sweeney  simply evaded the questions and was not forthcoming.  Sweeney's responses  were most curious as I understand he's among the strongest in Commercial  Support and my experience with him to date is consistent with this view.  We  learned in the last couple of days that e-mails were circulating within  Liquids (commercial support and commercial) back to early summer concerning  the situation and need to hold the prudency (first booked in July).  Hardy  did not press for copies of these e-mails yesterday since, at this point, it  would not be terribly productive  but I find it very troubling that this kind  of communication was taking place so early in the process and all involved  were not informed beyond those close to Beasley.  The key issue here is that  David was asking for the information at the right time but was kept out of  the loop (not that his exposure reports did not include the M-to-M starting  in Nov. when we learned of the magnitude of the problem).  In hindsight, we  should not have allowed the Sept. 2.8 pre-pay to Vnesh until we had received  a satisfactory response.  However, given the fact that David was asking the  right people, it is unreasonable for anyone to be critical of his actions in  the least.    Thoughts or questions?  SY     Rick Buy 01/02/2000 00:34 To: David Hardy/LON/ECT@ECT cc:  (bcc: Steve W Young/LON/ECT)  Subject:   David- Would rather have done this by phone but there is no chance for the  next couple of days so I thought I would send you an e-mail.   Steve tells me that the message from Helsinki investigation has been  misinterpreted by you and you are feeling like you have been unjustly blamed  for at least part of the problem here. This is not how this situation is  being thought of here, as a matter of fact we in RAC are quite pleased with  the level of coverage on this deal from the outset and I believe it was RAC  that started sounding warning bells long before any other group did.  Your coverage of this deal has been of the highest level. All of us should  have picked up on the MTM vs cash issue but the DASH clearly stated that the  pre  pay was the determining control here which was monitored carefully and  nicely plotted historically. We could not produce that result in any other  area where we do business.  In any event, your performance is not being called into question here in the  least and you should take pride in the fact that we were on top of this deal  from the outset.    Having said all that, I believe there are some valuable lessons that RAC  needs to learn here and I think we need a meeting to discuss these. I think  one of the biggest problems here was that strong detective measures, AA  audit, RAC issues, etc were pointed out to commercial people and basically  ignored. This is what we have to focus on. More about this later.  In the mean time, continue to focus on this. It is a good lesson for the rest  of the group to amplify how important what we do is.   Keep up good work and have a beer.   Cheers, Rick  ","Rick: Thanks for the note to David. It had the desired impact as David walked around first thing and was very appreciative.

It is my pleasure to invite you to speak at Energy & Power Risk Management Magazine Conferences' new event, Australian Energy 2000, addressing the second Industry Briefing - ""Learning from US experience: Lessons to be learned from the restructuring North American markets"". I appreciate that you are speaking a lot for us at the moment (for which I am of course grateful) but, when researching, yours was a name that came up repeatedly as someone the market would like to hear from. I am hoping that perhaps you might need to see Paul Quilkey at some point in July and that we can provide you with another reason to cross the globe.  Rather like the industry briefing that you are giving at Power 2000 this year in Houston, this address will be presented to the entire conference before breaking into their streams.  Australian Energy 2000 will take a focused look at the latest problems facing energy players, with the two in-depth streams I mentioned above: one dedicated to energy pricing and trading and the other looking at risk management and the latest business issues.  This conference will be of the highly technical level that people have come to expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage participation from speakers in modifying the programme to suit the audience and issues at hand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please let me know; any help would be gratefully received.  This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy & Power Risk Management Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to attract the leading market players by providing a first-class programme with top-rated speakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy industry.  I have attached a copy of the programme for your information.  Unfortunately my schedule for this event is very tight. Please let me know if you would like to participate by reurn email as it is unlikely that we can speak on the phone as I am currently based in Hong Kong. If you would like to send a colleague, then I would be happy to discuss this but it would be great if you could complete the EPRM grand slam by addressing our three major annual events on three different continents!

Vince      Ravi Thuraisingham@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 02/15/2000 09:57:17 AM To: Mark Holsworth/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Vince Kaminski, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Spreadsheet database for purchase  Hi Mark, as per our discussion earlier today, here is the contract that KMI  wants us to sign.  Please review as soon as you can.  As I mentioned in our  discussion, I am heading up the EBS research group reporting to Vince  Kaminski and Stinson Gibner (MDand VP of Enron Global Research,  respectively).  Vince has asked me to talk you directly on matter such as  this rather than using EBS service since we will be performing much of the  work stationed out of Enron Corp and the database itself and any resulting  analysis will reside in Research.  I took a quick look at the contract and already found some things that seems  too restrictive.  For example, the following clause may need to be removed  unless you think it would not affect us:  Fourth paragraph:  "" (ii) that you are in a business that does not include  the operating of an online exchange or auction for bandwidth""    Strictly speaking, we are NOT in the business of online exchange or auction  for bandwidth (since that is how we differentiate our market-making activity  from other online exchange players such as Band-x and Rate exchange), our  trading activity can be loosely defined as such in an very immature trading  market such as the current status of telecom market.  What do you think?  I  would like to set up a meeting with you to discuss EBS and our role and how  this database will be used, etc... Please have your assistant call Kristy  Carnes to set up this meeting this week.  I thank you very much for offering to take a look at this at such a short  notice.

2022-04-08 13:25:00+00:00,true,2,"  Brad,  Here are my thoughts on your concerns.  * You needs curve inputs.  This is an IT job.  I can help you for the curves  before the system is properly set up.  * Intrinsic value vs Time value:    The intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes.  If you have a  rough idea about the allocation as   you did in the spreadsheet, we can calucate the intrinsic value within the  model.    The difference between the    total and the intrinsic will be the (option) time value. However, by  pre-allocating volumes, you killed some options.      In the storage model, volumes are allocated dynamically, therefore it is  hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs. time value.   * Factor of loading:  Factor of loadings are used to give historical  correlation matrix. The three factors correspond to   paralle shift, slopping and curveture.  The covariance matrix in the model  is expressed in the form         COVAR = row( vol_{i} ) *( Correl(i,j) )* Colum( vol_{j} ) where vols are  the implied volatilities from the vol curve.      (Correl (i,j)) =L*L' +residue (small)    where L is the factor of loading matrix.  So in a simple words, the factor of  loadings (say, 60x3) are a simplier way for us to  remember the historical correlation matrix (say, 60x60).  Let me know if I can offer further help.  Zimin          Brad Horn                02/15/2000 07:15 AM  To: Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Sandra Henderson/HOU/ECT@ect  Subject: Storage Model: Simple Issues  Zimin:  Thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation.  Your right to  point out the similarity to market bids.  Here are some basic questions tied  to implementation and calibration:  Model Infrastructure/IT Support: I obviously need to re-build my link to the  forward curves as the model is not working in my new location.  Short-term  (aprox 1 month), I'd like to establish a link to the ENA database EGSPROD32  in order to fetch the long-dated price and volatility curves.  My link to ENA  forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated  by the new Bridgeline entity (database name and data structure yet to be  defined).  However, its not clear to me what is required in this two stage  process to support your model.  Any definition of model input or minimum  support requirements you provide is appreciated.  I'll then work with Sandra  Henderson, an Enron employee providing our IT support, to ensure the model  continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take  place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases.   Meanwhile, is there anything you think you can do to ensure Im up and running  quickly?  SANDRA: linking EXCEL spreadsheets to Bridgeline forward curves will be key  to all our pricing projects, not just the storage model supplied by Research.  Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Value: it would be helpful to decompose the model's  calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic (time or  option) value.  I could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model  inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value,  and then through a simple  difference I could  determine the extrinsic value.  Ive included a simple  spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review.  I wanted to  share this with you to ask the following: does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently  than the simple difference proposed? do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the  backcode C-code via .dll in order to ensure run-time is faster?    My goal here is straightforward: a) to better understand the model and its  sensitivities.; and b) to determine if and when the option approach is  associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of  the time spreads.    Factor Loadings: What are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with  regards to factor loadings and how I should interpret the graph of the 3  factors calculated?  Factor loadings have always been a mystery to me.  For  example, what problems should I be looking for as a warning against  mispricing?  What, if anything, is implied about 1 day price change or  expected curve re-shapings (after all, curve-reshapings are key to storage  valuation!!!)?  Calibration: we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics  which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs.  I'll share the  data when we are and model results once Im up and running.  ","Brad, Here are my thoughts on your concerns. * You need curve inputs. This is an IT job. I can help you with the curves before the system is properly set up. * Intrinsic value vs. time value: The intrinsic value is a straightforward but simple principle."

Join us for a comprehensive two-day training workshop March 1-2, 2000 that addresses these issues and accommodates both new and experienced professionals.  Hosted by the Energy Institute at the University of Houston's College of Business Administration, the training workshop features an introductory day that will refresh participants on the basics of the electric power market and key aspects of the restructuring process in Texas and the U.S.  The second day targets advanced issues in the emerging marketplace and case studies for practicioners.  The training workshop will be held at the Center for Executive Development at the UH-CBA.  Instructors are Ms. Dottie Anderson and Mr. Jim Stanton, each with extensive experience in the power industry and ERCOT implementation, and Dr. Michelle Michot Foss, director of the Energy Institute (see biographies, following workshop details).

Our group will assume roles centered around ""regulators,"" ""power marketers,"" the present ""investor owned utility"" and the ""town"" itself. A town meeting will be convened in which each entity is allowed to present their issues in an effort to persuade municipal decision-makers that theirs is the best option. Embedded in the exercise is the regulatory and operational framework that is built into the modules leading up to this participatory segment. Frequent references to the basic materials provided to the workshop participants will be encouraged in the process of moderating discussions that the workshop facilitators will implement. *Congestion Management Congestion management is one of the most critical components of ERCOT implementation.  A number of approaches exist for pricing electricity during periods of high demand.  Each methodology bears important consequences for both providors and customers.  Workshop participants will participate in construction of a virtual transmission grid and experiment with different methods of managing congestion. 4:00 Re-cap, Q&A  INSTRUCTORS Ms. Dottie Anderson Ms. Anderson has over 19 years experience in the energy industry with extensive experience in federal and state regulatory policy analysis and advocacy on behalf of natural gas and electric companies.

Essentially we have three choices: 1.  for $2700/yr, the standard edition (11 issues, excluding the monthly  ""special feature"" article) 2.  for $3800/yr the premium edition, (standard edition PLUS the monthly  ""special feature"" article, as in three attached examples) 3. for $10,000/yr the premium edition plus quarterly forward price view for  36 months.  Poten explains that 85% of their subscribers take the premium service.  No  one has ever asked for the $10,000/yr long-term price forecast.  I have an  interest in a longer term price forecast and hope that it may be useful to  others in the corporation. The example copies attached include the following Special Feature articles: 99Feb - Analysis of Resid Trades in the Eastern Mediterranean 99Sep - Patterns of Fuel Oil Trade in the Western Hemisphere 99Dec - Analysis of the Resid Market in Chile One either takes all or none of them for the incremental $1100/yr.

2022-04-08 13:16:29+00:00,true,2,"  Hi Grant,  Hope all is well with you. I trust you got my message via the voicemail that Ileft with Vince late Friday afternoon about my inability to travel - I'm trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of week's time when my ear has cleared up, and I look forward to meeting with you one day.  I wrote to Vince last week asking for a favour, but I'm not sure ifhe is there in Houston. I know that you guys are probably very busy but I was wondering if you can write a few sentences for me. I'm sending out some sample chapters to the people who responded positively (all of them!) to my request for some feedback on the book. Chapter 1 has an 'overview' of the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter. Could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter?  I'm including what I have already written (although I think it has changed slightly from this version) so that you can see the style.  Many thanks and best regards.  Chris.    2 Overview of this Book  This book aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives.  In the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets, and which underlie the rest of the book.  As well as introducing the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and Monte Carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book.  In Chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices.  Apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices. We look at the well-know process of GBM as well as mean reversion, stochastic volatility and jump processes, discussing each, and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated.  Chapter 3, written by Vince Kaminski and Grant Masson of Enron Capital and Trade .  Chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets.  Although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves.  What we do in this chapter  Chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not-so-common derivative structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses.  Examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as energy swaptions, compound options, Asian (or average rate) options, Barriers, lookbacks, and ladder options.  Chapter 6 investigates single and multi-factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives.  Closed form solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jumps.  Chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and American style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6.  Simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options.  In order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial tree scheme is developed.  This tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard American style options.  Chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the market observed forward curve.  The approach results in a multi-factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form.  Closed-form solutions are developed for pricing standard European options and efficient Monte Carlo schemes for exotic options.  The chapter finishes with a discussion of the valuation of American style options.  Chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions. In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time.  We begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7.  The general model of chapter 7 ideally suited to multi-factor hedging and this is also discussed.  Chapter 10 looks at the key risk-management concept of Value at Risk applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios.  After discussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs (volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated.  We then compare the fours major methodologies for computing VaR; Delta, Delta-gamma, historical simulation and Monte-Carlo simulation.  Finally, we look at testing the VaR estimates for various underlying energy market variables.","Hi Grant, Hope all is well with you.

2022-04-08 10:13:48+00:00,true,2,"  Hi Vince,  Hope all is well with you. I'm looking forward to seeing you again next week and meeting with Grant. Can you guys do me  favour? I'm sending out some sample chapters to the people who responded positively (all of them!) to my request for some feedback on the book. Chapter 1 has an 'overview' of the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter. Could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter?  I'm including what I have already written so that you can see the style.  Many thanks and best regards.  Chris.    2 Overview of this Book  This book aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives.  In the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets, and which underlie the rest of the book.  As well as introducing the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and Monte Carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book.  In Chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices.  Apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices. We look at the well-know process of GBM as well as mean reversion, stochastic volatility and jump processes, discussing each, and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated.  Chapter 3, written by Vince Kaminski and Grant Masson of Enron Capital and Trade .  Chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets.  Although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves.

Attached note below clarifies Poten's proposal on the $10,000/yr subscription. Essentially we have three choices: 1.  for $2700/yr, the standard edition (11 issues, excluding the monthly  ""special feature"" article) 2.  for $3800/yr the premium edition, (standard edition PLUS the monthly  ""special feature"" article, as in three attached examples) 3. for $10,000/yr the premium edition plus quarterly forward price view for  36 months.  Poten explains that 85% of their subscribers take the premium service.  No  one has ever asked for the $10,000/yr long-term price forecast.  I have an  interest in a longer term price forecast and hope that it may be useful to  others in the corporation. The example copies attached include the following Special Feature articles: 99Feb - Analysis of Resid Trades in the Eastern Mediterranean 99Sep - Patterns of Fuel Oil Trade in the Western Hemisphere 99Dec - Analysis of the Resid Market in Chile One either takes all or none of them for the incremental $1100/yr.

He is a power engineer type who has previously worked  at northwestern US and New Zealand utilities on various projects including  asset planning and hydro scheduling.  He was hired by EI Structuring to  oversee modeling efforts using SDDP, Henwood, etc. Because of the recent  implosion at EI APACHE, Tom's group has effectively evaporated, and thus he  is looking for a new home. He has some  finance background  from having to  do  asset evaluation for utility rate filings.  He has almost no options  experience.  He seems to have quite a bit of experience in some classes of OR  problems.    Clearly the most obvious fit is with my group, but the idea is for you all to  see if Tom has a tool set that may be of use to other research projects.   And, as usual, the personality fit is the other aspect to examine.  This is meant to be casual. If the consensus is positive, then I will explore  the formalities of such a transfer.

Publish on CAIDA web pages   -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Appendix A: Questions from the earlier draft CAIDA WG charters    a. What types of network- and transport-layer metrics are being     used by ISPs in engineering and operating their networks?     By Customers for verifying service guarantees?  b. What new services are being (or are likely to be) offered, e.g.     DIFFSERV?  Is there a need for higher-layer metrics to better     monitor and manage these services?  c. Will these new differentiated transport- and     application-layer services need new metrics?  d. How can the service metrics be measured in a multi-ISP     environment?  e. How can customers verify these measurements?  f. What requirements would service measurement introduce for     equipment vendors?    g. How relevant are specific techniques (e.g. which flow) and     points of measurement to specific users (ISP, customer, etc.)     requirements?  h. How do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived     by users? How do they correlate with performance?  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Appendix B: Background on the IETF Working Groups   * RTFM WG: Realtime traffic Flow Measurement  RTFM is concerned with passive measurements of two-way traffic flows, specified in terms of their end-point attributes.  Its primary goal was  To produce an improved Traffic Flow Measurement Model considering at least the following needs:   a. Wider range of measurable quantities, e.g. those     relating to IPv6, and to class of service  b. Simpler ways to specify flows of interest  c. Better ways to control access to measured flow data  d. Strong focus on data reduction capabilities  e. Efficient hardware implementation   * IPPM WG: IP Performance Measurement  The IPPM WG charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can be applied to the quality, performance, and reliability of Internet data delivery services. These metrics will be designed such that they can be performed by network operators, end users, or independent testing groups. It is important that the metrics not represent a value judgement (i.e. define ""good"" and ""bad""), but rather provide unbiased quantitative measures of performance.  RFCs   Framework for IP Performance Metrics (RFC 2330)   Metrics:      Connectivity (RFC 2678),      One-way Delay (RFC 2679), One-way Packet Loss (RFC 2680)      Round-trip Delay (RFC 2681)  I-Ds      Bulk Transfer Capacity (2x)      Instantaneous Packet Delay Variation      One-way Loss Patterns   * Other WGs  The RMONMIB WG is thinking about 'Application Performance Measurement.'  This is clearly a hard problem (e.g. does this just mean response-time measurement, can it be done by passive means, how should the measurements be presented, etc.).   In short  - RTFM provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic    volumes  - IPPM has concentrated on transport-layer behaviour of the    current, best-effort Internet.  - RMONMIB is beginning to consider application-layer measurement  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  ","Hi Amy, Jim Irvine (EBS head of Network Planning) and I (Team Lead, EBS Research) will attend the meeting.

2022-04-08 09:34:28+00:00,true,3,"  Ted,  We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followed-up on  specific instances you have mentioned - I believe they date back to 1998 and  prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout 1999, and  the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has  changed since then. We are not so Barry-dependent. We have a team of quality  risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary  recruiting ground for the RAC team (David Port, Oliver Gaylard).   Barry's role is much less hands-on now and he is not our candidate for the  Global Products position - this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney. The role I  suggest for Barry is the high level co-ordination of the operations team -  his energy, enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan, combined with his  considerable institutional knowledge, making a superior candidate difficult  to find. Frankly, I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth, but to  address the relationship issue that clearly exists - I do not belittle this  issue, and while I don't think that anyone can point to any ""prosecutable""  offences that Barry may have committed in recent history, his management  style doesn't help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and  objective. I will say that he has always been open and frank (very frank)  with me - indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a  different story to tell on Helsinki.  As an aside, I have not been involved in or consulted on the 'World Tour',  although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks  back. I think it is great that Brent Price is involved, but we would be happy  to contribute staff to this too.  Regards  Fernley     To: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Rick Buy, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London    Fernley, As we discussed earlier this year, I have serious concerns about Barry that I  think are both well-founded and reasonably well documented.  To be fair, I  will say that since Q1 of last year, I have not seen any FURTHER  ""prosecutable"" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more  communicative.  However, I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his  transformation, particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in  charge of the office.  Probably more to the point, it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team  that is not so Barry-dependent.  Evidence to this effect are, the fact that  he is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from  Houston has to be part of the ""World Tour""  in Europe (Brent Price), that  your candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David  Port or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve  Young.  Further for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry  has a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell,  and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I  just happen to be the most vocal. Ted    Fernley Dyson 02/08/2000 04:07 PM To: Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Trading Support Operations - London  Rick,  Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support  function, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we  already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.  The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more  permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry  understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we  would give him/her the job.   I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the  team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant  value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'.  However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and,  whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I  can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.  I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted  within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in  London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy  to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will  be monitoring the situation very closely.  Regards  Fernley.

Dayton has given Enron the approval to move this storage.  I told TCO the second option would be the most viable option, and it should  not comprise TCO's position with its other shippers.   As of right now, TCO has put all retro requests on hold. The bills will  probably go out with these penalties on it. However, TCO will revisit the  penalty issue, once the dust has settled. We are not the only shipper that  incurred penalties, and TCO wants to treat everyone fairly.

2022-04-08 09:06:09+00:00,true,3,"  Fernley, As we discussed earlier this year, I have serious concerns about Barry that I  think are both well-founded and reasonably well documented.  To be fair, I  will say that since Q1 of last year, I have not seen any FURTHER  ""prosecutable"" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more  communicative.  However, I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his  transformation, particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in  charge of the office.  Probably more to the point, it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team  that is not so Barry-dependent.  Evidence to this effect are, the fact that  he is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from  Houston has to be part of the ""World Tour""  in Europe (Brent Price), that  your candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David  Port or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve  Young.  Further for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry  has a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell,  and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I  just happen to be the most vocal.

The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more  permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry  understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we  would give him/her the job.   I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the  team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant  value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'.  However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and,  whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I  can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.  I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted  within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in  London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy  to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will  be monitoring the situation very closely.  Regards  Fernley.

2022-04-08 18:14:52+00:00,true,3,"  Brad,  As per our previous discussions, Vince wanted me to give you the background  on our request to bring Patricia Tlapek into the Research Group at the very  top end of the manager group.  The justification for this was not only her  extraordinary performance in setting up our Technical Analysis Section but  also our reliance on her to build this group and expand its scope.  This memo is in response to your request today to document our reasoning.  This past year Patricia was extremely successful in building internal  clientele for her products and recommendations - she is now widely relied on  by gas, power, crude and equity marketers, as well as traders from the  Calgary office.  In addition, she developed and presented seminars to bring  traders up to speed on techniques in technical analysis.  Also this last year Patricia built and populates daily the Research Group's  intranet site on technical analysis.  As a crowning achievement (but just the beginning), Patricia was given the  authority to actually trade natural gas as Jeff Shankman, Managing Director,  authorized her book for technical analysis trading.    Currently, we are proceeding with the expansion of her group personnel-wise  and she is agressively working to gain authority from other groups to trade  live books on other energy commodities and energy-related equities.  For these reasons, we want to peg Patricia's salary at the top of the pay  scale.  Thanks for expediting this effort.  --- Mike","Brad, As per our previous discussions, Vince wanted me to give you the background on our request to bring Patricia Tlapek into the Research Group at the very top end of the manager group.

However, the following steps must be taken for your employees to use  the ATES system and code their time to these work orders:  MANAGERS - Identify employees within your RC that will need to charge time to  either or both of these work orders.  Please let your Assistants know who  these employees are. ASSISTANTS - Based on the information you receive from your managers, you  must add 1 or both of the work orders to each employee's profile in the Org  Database so that they are able to charge time to the work order in ATES.

The development period for these algorithms will anywhere from 3  months to 9 months depending on the complexity. This is in-line with when EBS  anticipates trade volumes to really pickup.

2022-04-08 17:33:28+00:00,true,3,"  All,  I will be giving a 40min presentation on the above topic at the EPRM Energy  2000 conference in April. The bulletpoints are:  Balancing market risk and credit risk to achieve a reliable estimation of  total risk Incorporating market risk into a credit risk model Calculating probability of default using credit risk and market risk Refining business practice to reflect credit risk and market risk evaluations  My proposed approach is to quickly step through the practical process of  modelling credit risk, resulting in measures for expected loss and  credit-VAR; then show how default probs can be calculated using bond and  equity data. Finally I'll describe how credit risk can be mitigated using  credit derivatives - plugging EnronCredit.com of course.  Any other ideas for broad topics and/or specific points to mention will be  appreciated. The presentation has to be submitted next week.

I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00  -   a very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.  I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily - interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings, structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good background information for sustainable builder folks.  Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.   <A HREF=""http://www.romanconcrete.com/"">Roman Concrete Research by David Moore</A>   Regards,  Harry Francis","Folks, I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and development of pozzolonic materials...lime and clay - Roman Cement - that I think will be interesting to the group.

Some of this material has already appeared on the metrics mailing list, the older material comes from personal emails.  I'm posting it again to give us all some more ideas to think about.  For those who are able to attend the WG meeting in San Jose this Thursday (2 Mar), I'd like to spend time in the morning getting to know about attendees interests and experience in making Internet measurements. I suggest that a good way to do this would be to have each group give a short (10 minutes, <= 5 slides) presentation of their measurement work. That should allow us to make a longer list of metrics to discuss in more detail for the rest of the meeting.  Comments please!  I'll send out a revised/updated agenda late tomorrow.  Cheers, Nevil  PS: We now have about 40 people on the mailing list.  Please copy all     further 'metrics' email to the list so that we can all see it.

One simple example is keeping track of DNS response times.  Daniel McRobb offered the following ..  I also believe a similar simple technique could be used to track TCP > response times, and this gets even more interesting... you only need > to be able to see traffic in one direction (from client to server) to > get a fairly accurate round-trip time from the client to the server > (irrespective of how far away the client is from your measurement > host), because of TCPs three-way handshake for connection > establishment; when you see the opening SYN, you wait for the client > to ACK the server's SYN ACK and you have the client->server round-trip > time.  I think you've actually already done some of this?  We could > also potentially try to correlate DNS queries and TCP connections, > perhaps determining some probabilities in a given environment of a > host initiating a TCP connection to a host for which it just received > an A record, and track various application-level response times (I'd > personally love to have a lot of data on the ratio of DNS response > time to TCP transfer time for HTTP connections).  Even if the > measurement makes no attempt to discern what constitutes a Web > transaction to the user (a full page, usually many TCP connections). > > Anyway, I think there are some fairly interesting things we can > measure with simple techniques, these are just some simple ones. > There may be some interesting things we could do by digging into > payloads of a few of the other highly-utilized applications, but doing > it for TCP is a nightmare perfomance-wise.  But we now have the basic > infrastructure to do things with DNS over UDP.  We can probably cover > any open UDP protocol without incurring performance penalties that > would make it completely unusable.  SNMP, for example... while its > application is limited, network service providers would find > round-trip time information for SNMP packets from their network > management stations to agents very useful.  I think there are some > rudimentary things we can do with TCP as well, and I also think some > sites would be interested in having some rudimentary information.  For > example, a weighted (by traffic) round-trip time distribution for TCP > traffic to/from all networks with which you communicated (say at /24 > granularity).  This gives sites a notion of how close they are to > those they talk to most frequently.

While we > all know the value of that, I think it's significant in that active > probers can be run on the same host, decoupled from the actual > measurement, and with timestamps coming from kernel space (BPF).  I've > been thinking about this for a long time, because eventually I'd like > skitter (and other tools) to be able to do use TCP packets for probing, > with no need for things like IP firewall code; if I can just properly > time non-blocking connects, and count on the passive tool to see the SYN > and SYN ACK, I can use any TCP port for round-trip time measurements and > not trick my kernel by sending TCP packets on a raw socket.

Nevil Brownlee comments that he's also very interested in developing the RTFM meter as a platform for more general measurements. Two areas seem interesting (apart from getting more information from TCP streams):~  + QoS / DifServ performance       (what metrics do we need to characterise this?)  + IPSEC (what metrics will still be useful when we can't       look at port numbers?  what kinds of traffic can still be       identified?)

A.  'metrics@caida.org' mailing list    B.  WG Charters, Meeting on 2 Mar 00   A. 'metrics@caida.oeg' mailing list  I've set up a single mailing list with this name, for discussions on WG topics, passive measurements, etc.  To start with it's a moderated list (i.e. you have to be a member of the list to post to it, you join by sending email to nevil@caida.org asking to be added to the 'metrics' list), with the following initial set of members:          Sue Moon <sbmoon@sprintlabs.com>,         Brett Watson <bwatson@vix.com>,         Hans-Werner Braun <hwb@nlanr.net>,         Matt Mathis <mathis@psc.edu>,         Ian Graham <ian@cs.waikato.ac.nz>,         Tony McGregor <tonym@nlanr.net>,         John Cleary <jcleary@cs.waikato.ac.nz>,         Joerg Micheel <joerg@cs.waikato.ac.nz>,         Kevin Thompson <kthomp@mci.net>,         Jambi Gambar <jambi@mci.net>,         Daniel McRobb <dwm@caida.org>,         David Moore <dmoore@caida.org>,         Sean McCreary <mccreary@caida.oe,rg>         Rene Hatem <rene@canarie.ca>,         Shankar Rao <srao@qwest.net>,         Cindy Bickerstaff <cbickers@td2cad.intel.com>,         Jeff Sedayao <sedayao@orpheus.sc.intel.com>,         Steve Feldman <feldman@twincreeks.net>,         Bill Woodcock <woody@zocalo.net>  Two questions for CAIDA Members:   i. Who else would you suggest be invited to join the list?  ii. Should the list continue to be moderated, or should it      be changed into an open list?   B.  'Working Group' developments  Following the CAIDA Members' meeting on 8 Feb 00 I've attempted to define exactly what problem we could consider getting an IETF Working Group started on.  My summary of the existing IETF WGs with interests in metrics is given below (Appendix B), but it seems unlikely that we could get a new IETF WG started.  I believe that we should instead run a single CAIDA Working Group on 'Network Metrics,' rather than the two proposed earlier.  My draft of its charter is appended below.  It focuses on producing educational material about network measurement, and on developing new metrics - these were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the CAIDA members.  The WG co-chairs are   Sue Moon (SprintLabs) and Brett Watson (MFN/Abovenet)  You are invited to attend the first WG meeting. The agenda is as follows ..     Agenda for CAIDA WG meeting on: Thursday 2 Mar 00                                    -----------------    10 am - 4 pm, AboveNet, Downtown SJC (see below for details)    ------------            ------------     1. Review WG Charter       - Is it reasonable as set out in the draft?       - What should be removed or added?     2. Work through revised charter in detail       - Identify the work required for each part       - Determine who's willing to work on it       - Attempt to determine delivery times     3. Discussion of new metrics       - First attempt at making a list of metrics to be considered     4. Anything else ?  Location: AboveNet is located in the Knight-Ridder Building, attached to the Fairmont Hotel complex.  The address is    50 W. San Fernando St.   San Jose, CA  95113  RSVP: To help us with organising the meeting, please send email to    nevil@caida.org telling us how many will attend from    your organisation.

How?  Where?  By whom?      - Active vs passive, end-to-end vs provider network only,        application vs transport layer      - Rating schemes: provider 'net performance' pages, Internet        'Weather Map's, Keynote, etc.      Publish as CAIDA web pages, or maybe as an Info RFC     + Survey paper on metrics and Internet Measurement      - Current measurement efforts (Surveyor, RIPE Test Traffic,        AMP, IPERF, AT&T, Keynote,skitter, ...)      - Current tools      Publish as CAIDA web pages   2 Service Metrics    + Define new metrics      - Taxonomy of current metrics (IPPM, RTFM, ITU, ..)      - Summary of metrics used for current services      - Gather information/ideas about new/emerging services,        especially DiffServ-based ones      - Make list of new metrics, either to improve measurement of        existing services or to support new ones        [list of 'metrics' questions (Appendix A) goes here]     + Organise experimental implementation/testing of tools      for new metrics     + Make recommendations on implementation      - Define core set of 'really useful' metrics      - recommend that CAIDA implement these as a        'Service Measurement Toolkit'     + Publish new metric definitions through IPPM or RTFM     + Produce document ""measurement requirements for hardware/software      vendors.""  Publish on CAIDA web pages   -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Appendix A: Questions from the earlier draft CAIDA WG charters    a. What types of network- and transport-layer metrics are being     used by ISPs in engineering and operating their networks?     By Customers for verifying service guarantees?  b. What new services are being (or are likely to be) offered, e.g.     DIFFSERV?  Is there a need for higher-layer metrics to better     monitor and manage these services?  c. Will these new differentiated transport- and     application-layer services need new metrics?  d. How can the service metrics be measured in a multi-ISP     environment?  e. How can customers verify these measurements?  f. What requirements would service measurement introduce for     equipment vendors?    g. How relevant are specific techniques (e.g. which flow) and     points of measurement to specific users (ISP, customer, etc.)     requirements?  h. How do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived     by users? How do they correlate with performance?  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Appendix B: Background on the IETF Working Groups   * RTFM WG: Realtime traffic Flow Measurement  RTFM is concerned with passive measurements of two-way traffic flows, specified in terms of their end-point attributes.  Its primary goal was  To produce an improved Traffic Flow Measurement Model considering at least the following needs:   a. Wider range of measurable quantities, e.g. those     relating to IPv6, and to class of service  b. Simpler ways to specify flows of interest  c. Better ways to control access to measured flow data  d. Strong focus on data reduction capabilities  e. Efficient hardware implementation   * IPPM WG: IP Performance Measurement  The IPPM WG charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can be applied to the quality, performance, and reliability of Internet data delivery services. These metrics will be designed such that they can be performed by network operators, end users, or independent testing groups. It is important that the metrics not represent a value judgement (i.e. define ""good"" and ""bad""), but rather provide unbiased quantitative measures of performance.  RFCs   Framework for IP Performance Metrics (RFC 2330)   Metrics:      Connectivity (RFC 2678),      One-way Delay (RFC 2679), One-way Packet Loss (RFC 2680)      Round-trip Delay (RFC 2681)  I-Ds      Bulk Transfer Capacity (2x)      Instantaneous Packet Delay Variation      One-way Loss Patterns   * Other WGs  The RMONMIB WG is thinking about 'Application Performance Measurement.'  This is clearly a hard problem (e.g. does this just mean response-time measurement, can it be done by passive means, how should the measurements be presented, etc.).   In short  - RTFM provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic    volumes  - IPPM has concentrated on transport-layer behaviour of the    current, best-effort Internet.  - RMONMIB is beginning to consider application-layer measurement  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ","Hi Vince, I (and possibly Stinson as well) will be attending this initial meeting; looks like a kick-off type of meeting; I'll try to attend to drill into what they can offer and what we have committed.

2022-04-08 05:50:23+00:00,true,3,"  Scott-- Something for you to consider: If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the  curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as  possible.  This means using as few ""formula based"" curves as possible and as  many Gas Daily publication postings as possible.  I'm not sure how you or  your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but  I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating  transport p&l.  In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are  Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas.  These could  potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates.  The  only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index  posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.  Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue  because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES  business in our portfolio, the times have changed.  Currently we are using  ""formula based"" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport  p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and  how we are marking the curves.  For example, today's Gas Daily postings  compared to our curve markings are as follows: GAS DAILY   GAS DAILY SPREAD   SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES TCO pool $2.985   $1.565     $.10 TCO citygate $4.55  CNG North $3.39   $  .585     $.16 CNG South $3.305   $  .670     $.16~ CNG Citygate $3.975  Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong.  There are  two solutions that I see.  One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which  in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other  solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more  closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace.  That's up to you.   Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads  are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know  what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it),  we need to focus on it being accurate.  Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work  on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.

2022-04-08 17:37:09+00:00,true,3,"    India: Enron aftermath     Business Line - 02/21/2000     Abhay Mehta     Copyright (C) 2000 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) -  Asia Intelligence Wire     Power Play     A Study of the Enron Project      * Publishers: Orient Longman, New Delhi * Price: Rs. 195     THE Enron power project at Dabhol in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra has  been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the    inception of the project proposal in 1992; and the sordid tale ends only  in 1997, with the Supreme Court of India refusing to even    admit an appeal against the Bombay High Court decision, of December 1996,  which while commenting that ""This case has    highlighted to the people as to how even after 50 years of Independence,  political considerations outweigh the public interest and    the interest of the State and to what extent the Government can go to  justify its actions not only before the public but even before    the courts of law"" - yet dismissed a public interest petition against the  project on the (purely technical) ground of res judicata, even    though new facts, new arguments, new evidence of the violation of the laws  of the land had been advanced by the petitioners.     The fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and  recorded, despite the petitioners adducing the required    evidence, can only be termed as strange, perhaps bizarre.     Abhay Mehta's simple, factual documentation - in fact a chronological  narration - of all events, including the process of bending all    rules, of subverting the law for promoting a project involving  unparalleled future liabilities for Maharashtra, indeed for the whole of    India - is not only masterly, it is devastating.     It is a short, pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by  all thinking citizens of this country. Barring the    concluding chapter, the epilogue, there are no personal comments, only  facts, disseminated from the original papers, mostly 'secret'    documents.     All documentation has been carefully, faithfully recorded, including  extracts from supposedly 'top secret' minutes of cabinet    committee meetings; and the specific violations of the law (which were  opposed by a few public spirited civil servants, much to    their disadvantage) have been pointed up. Apart from an introductory  'Primer on Electricity' - introduced for the benefit of the    layman, explaining some technical issues relating to electricity  generation, transmission and distribution - and the background of the    events of 1991, the foreign exchange crisis, and the aftermath of the  crisis, the other fifteen chapters, three appendices and fourteen    annexes of the small book (of 226 pages) packs in an enormous volume of  factual information. The strange saga of the Enron    project, and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single  project poses for the country, need to be briefly recounted    here, for essentially, it is the coming generation which would have to  face the problem.     The MSEB has contracted to buy - and if not used, to pay for - 2000 MW of  electricity (for a period of 20 years) from the    Dabhol Power Company (the legal entity set up by Enron, as an unlimited  liability company registered in India, through a maze of    intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more 'front'  companies registered in various tax-free havens.     Abhay Mehta has indicated the total payments to Enron over 20 years amount  to $ 35 billion (at 1998 exchange rates, around Rs.    1,25,000 crores) over the life of the project. One must record that: (a)  crude oil/oil product prices have as of writing, more than    doubled since the above calculations were made. A per the 'doctored'  figures presented by the company (and its advocate), the    charge per unit of electricity supplied, at the 1998 level of prices, was  to 4.39 cent (per unit) as 'capacity charge' and 3.43 cents    (per unit) for 'energy costs'.     The former is indexed to the US inflation rate, and the latter to  international fuel prices. The former may be assumed to have gone    up only marginally (rounded to 4.4 cents per unit); we know that fuel  prices have more than doubled internationally over 1999.    Assuming the 'fuel costs' to have increased less than 100 per cent - even  though international prices have more than doubled - we    may assume (for 1999) energy costs of 6.85 cents per units, making for a  total payment of 11.25 US cents per unit of electricity    supplied by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) to MSEB in late 1999, in Phase  I of the project.     Within another two years, at 2000 MW, the annual offtake (for 365 days X  24 hours/day) would be 17.52 billion KWH; and at    11.25 cents per unit, the total payment amounts to $1.97 billion annually;  for 20 years, this workout to $ 39.4 billion.     This is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or  capacity charge. At today's exchange rate - about Rs.43.5 per US    dollar - in rupee terms this works out to wore than Rs. 175,000 crores (as  compared to Rs. 125,000 crores indicated by Abhay    Mehta). This is the cost to MSEB in rupee; and to the country in foreign  exchange as payment to just one project authority, for    supply of part of the power required in Maharashtra.     The really significant point to note in this connection is that this  payment - and considerably more, depending on (a) future increase    in'capacity charges' depending on US inflation rate, and international  prices of LNGaphtha (for 'fuel costs'), and (b) depreciation of    the exchange rate of the rupee vis-a-vis the US dollar - is obligatory;  the assets of the MSEB, the Maharashtra government    indeed, all assets of the Government of India (present and future) are  mortgaged to Enron, by way of sovereign guarantees    extended by both governments.     The other significant point in this connection is that - as predicted by  all independent Indian experts as well as the World Bank -the    Enron project he forced the MSEB to cut its offtake of Tata Electric  Company's and its own much cheaper thermal power    already; in a postscript dated August 1999, Abhay Mehta has indicated that  already, the MSEB had stopped buying between 200    and 250 MW of power from Tata Electric (available at Rs. 1.80 per unit)  and has had to backdown its own Chandrapur thermal    power station (cost of this power being Rs. 1.20 per unit), while forced  to buy more expensive Enron power at Rs. 5 per unit.     The loss to MSEB on this count alone comes to Rs. 460 crore per year.     This had in fact, been predicted earlier even by the World Bank.     It is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was  contrived, by a deliberate campaign of 'disinformation', of    blatant lies, of sidelining of expert opinion, not only of independent  experts but also the GOI's own official advisers in this matter,    namely, the Central Electricity Authority as well as that of the World  Bank, which was resolutely opposed to this project. The    detailed facts, the letters exchanged in the above context, the pressure  tactics adopted, the flouting of all procedures norms, even    statutory provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, are all carefully  documented by Abhay Mehta.     Mehta correctly concludes: ""We frequently blame external agencies - like  the World Bank - for all our problems, when, as a    matter of fact, we ourselves are our own worst enemies. In the instant  case, the World Bank not only advised the Government of    India against the project, it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of  the total inadvisability of this project. In fact, one must note    here that in 1996, neighbouring Pakistan, which had entered into a  somewhat similar MoU with Enron, cancelled the project (and    the Power Purchase Agreement with Enron), for a $ 670 million, 782 MW  residual oil-fuelled power plant, even though that    Agreement had stipulated Enron power supply at a fixed rate of 6.4 US  cents per KWH over a 30 year period. (Note the    estimated rate of 11.25 cents per KWH for Dabhol power for the MSEB in  December 1999, which works out to around Rs. 5    per unit).     One could go on; but one must leave the reader to go through Abhay Mehta's  crisp, factual, matter of fact narration of the Enron    saga, and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the  story, about 'The Next Round of Scams'.     For quite some time, the ruling elite in India has been intent on  'privatising' all public enterprises; and even 'utilities' are no    exception. The 'unbundling' of infrastructure with a view to privatisation  of all the 'profitable' segments. All this - as per the current    'disinformation campaign' - is supposedly in the interest of  rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply.     The author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the  Government - by the Torrent Group - of the Ahmedabad and    Surat Electricity companies at less than one-tenth of the market value of  the assets of thee facilities. Again, much like the Enron    saga, all objections by the Finance Department of the Gujarat government  were overruled.     And, Abhay Mehta has predicated that this onslaught - the break-up of  power utilities into three segments, generation, transmission    and distribution, - with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the  new thrust by the ruling elite, for reasons that do not require to    be spelt out.     Though Mehta had the examples of the Torrent Group takeover of Ahmedabad  and Surat Electricity companies, and of the break    up of the Orissa State Electricity Board before him, yet his statement can  be stated today to be prophetic; the UPSEB is now on    the firing line. The recent strike by the workers and engineers of the  UPSEB in protest of the announced UP government decision    to trifurcate the UPSEB; and the Union Minister of Power, Mr. Rangarajan  Kumaramangalam's statement that the UPSEB is a    loss making, inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities  after the trifurcation - need to be noted.     That 40 per cent of the dues of the UPSEB are from the UP Government; that  tariffs for UP electricity supply are fixed by the UP    government and not by the UPSEB; that the UPSEB does not have the cash  even for routine maintenance as a result of the above    - these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider. That the  remedy for UPSEB lies in a different kind of reform and    restructuring, is not even to be debated. The whole idea is to privatise  the profitable segments, and to leave the public sector entity    with all the problem areas, including rural energy supply. It is against  this background that Abhay Mehta's book needs to be widely    disseminated, read, and its implications understood.     What is at stake is not a 'utility' here or a PSU there. What is at stake  is the future of some 80 per cent of the have-nots in this    country.     What is at stake is the 'pillory' of the assets of the nation for private  aggrandisement.

We are not so Barry-dependent. We have a team of quality  risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary  recruiting ground for the RAC team (David Port, Oliver Gaylard).   Barry's role is much less hands-on now and he is not our candidate for the  Global Products position - this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney. The role I  suggest for Barry is the high level co-ordination of the operations team -  his energy, enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan, combined with his  considerable institutional knowledge, making a superior candidate difficult  to find. Frankly, I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth, but to  address the relationship issue that clearly exists - I do not belittle this  issue, and while I don't think that anyone can point to any ""prosecutable""  offences that Barry may have committed in recent history, his management  style doesn't help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and  objective. I will say that he has always been open and frank (very frank)  with me - indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a  different story to tell on Helsinki.  As an aside, I have not been involved in or consulted on the 'World Tour',  although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks  back.

To be fair, I  will say that since Q1 of last year, I have not seen any FURTHER  ""prosecutable"" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more  communicative.  However, I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his  transformation, particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in  charge of the office.  Probably more to the point, it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team  that is not so Barry-dependent.  Evidence to this effect are, the fact that  he is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from  Houston has to be part of the ""World Tour""  in Europe (Brent Price), that  your candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David  Port or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve  Young.  Further for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry  has a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell,  and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I  just happen to be the most vocal.

The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more  permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry  understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we  would give him/her the job.   I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the  team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant  value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'.  However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and,  whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I  can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.  I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted  within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in  London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy  to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will  be monitoring the situation very closely.  Regards  Fernley.           ","I agree fully with the last sentence.

Evidence to this effect are, the fact that  he is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from  Houston has to be part of the ""World Tour""  in Europe (Brent Price), that  your candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David  Port or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve  Young.  Further for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry  has a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell,  and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I  just happen to be the most vocal.

The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more  permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry  understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we  would give him/her the job.   I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the  team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant  value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'.  However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and,  whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I  can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.  I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted  within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in  London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy  to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will  be monitoring the situation very closely.  Regards  Fernley.

We heard from many  of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz  area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed.   Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen  sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable,  CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until:   1. it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or,    2. CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and          processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system.

2022-04-08 18:25:28+00:00,true,4,"  Chris--I apologize for having to revise the numbers I sent a few minutes ago, but I had made an erroneous assumption about the volume of SONAT storage gas that we could withdraw in March.  I will put these values into the spreadsheet that I sent earlier, but this will give you an idea of what the numbers look like.    As in my prior message, the above values for storage withdrawals assume that  we are maximizing the withdrawals from the so-called ""Directly Assigned Storage"" that ENA schedules on our behalf.  I believe that notwithstanding the above storage withdrawal values, we will still have storage inventory left at the  end of March since our withdrawals to date have been so low.   Both the Storage withdrawals shown above and the Flowing gas should flow on Primary firm capacity since we have been assigned this capacity by AGL.    The above  numbers also assume that we will be maximizing our withdrawals of AGL's IBSS (Incremental Bundled Storage Service) during March.  The IBSS withdrawals are not  included in the storage withdrawal volumes shown above, since we schedule the IBSS ourselves at AGL's citygate.   Note also that the total daily volume on Sonat--Stg WD plus Flowing-- is higher than in my prior transmittal.  The reason is that I am assuming no peaking inventory withdrawals during March versus daily withdrawals of approximately  2,800 dth/day in my prior transmittal.    This translates into a higher gas requirement from Enron.  Again, sorry for the confusion and this should do it.

2022-04-08 18:18:10+00:00,true,4,"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------  To all employees:   EOTT announced its financial results for the fourth quarter of 1999 today.  A full copy of the press release is attached.  Results set out in the press release include that recurring operating income nearly doubled to $10.5  million in the most recent quarter from $5.3 million in the same period in 1998.   Crude oil lease volumes increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 1999  compared to last year, with the North America-East of the Rockies segment volumes up  26% to an average of 406,600 barrels per day.  Acquisitions made in late 1998 and early 1999 were the primary reasons for the growth in recurring operating  income and lease volumes.  As a result of the realization of operating synergies from recent acquisitions, recurring operating expenses declined to $35.7 million in the fourth quarter of 1999 from $40.7 million in the third quarter of the same year.  For the full year 1999, EOTT reported net income of $7.6 million before non-recurring items and the cumulative effect of the accounting change, or  $0.30 per diluted unit, compared to a loss of $4.1 million, or $(0.21) per diluted unit, in 1998.  In total, EOTT reported a loss of $2.2 million, or $(0.09) per diluted unit, before the cumulative effect of an accounting change.  1999 was a turnaround year for EOTT's operations, with recurring operating income up  nearly five-fold over the prior year.  With our increased scale and scope from recent acquisitions and our continuing success in reducing  operating costs, we believe we are well positioned for 2000.   While there were some very positive aspects to our fourth quarter  performance, the overall results were disappointing due, in large part, to the negative financial impact of certain unauthorized activities which occurred in our now-discontinued NGL activities in the mid continent region.  You may rest assured that the company intends to take swift and thorough legal action  against the individual responsible for these activities, but you also need to be aware that these events will likely spark the curiosity of many within our industry. Accordingly, it is almost certain that EOTT employees will receive phone calls and inquiries from business acquaintances and counterparties wanting to know more about the unauthorized activities mentioned in our earnings release.  These matters are extremely sensitive and  potentially damaging to the  company's reputation, and any indiscreet or unauthorized comments by EOTT personnel  about these matters may only serve to harm the company's position.  Accordingly, I  am asking that EOTT employees refrain from discussing  the unauthorized  activities discussed in our earnings release with people outside of our company.   Generally speaking, any media or other external inquiries or requests for information about any item(s) mentioned in our earnings release should be referred to Dave Schafer with the Enron GPG Communications Group, at 713-853-6758.  Susan Ralph and our Credit Department will be responsible for handling any questions which may come in concerning the company's financial strength or credit posture, and Dana Gibbs will be responsible for addressing any specific questions which may come in concerning any effect which any of these matters may have upon any specific commercial transaction(s)  to which EOTT is a party.  If there are  any questions about any of these guidelines, or if you become unsure of how to handle any particular situation, please contact your supervisor or EOTT's  Legal Department right away.  I am extremely angered by these unauthorized activities, not only because of  the effect they have had on our 1999 results, but also because of the unfair way they have undermined countless hours of hard work  by hundreds of good and dedicated EOTT employees in 1999. These events are unfortunate, but they will not have a lasting effect upon our company.  EOTT's underlying earning power remains strong and our prospects for the future remain bright.  Your adherence to the guidelines set forth above will assist EOTT in getting through this difficult, but passing, situation.  Thank you in advance for your help.  And finally, I want to take this opportunity to thank all EOTT employees for  the tremendous job you have done in lowering our expenses and levels of spending throughout the organization.  Your initiatives, suggestions and cooperation in this area will be a major factor in helping EOTT strive to attain its  financial goals for 2000.

2022-04-08 09:35:08+00:00,true,4,"  Gas Rule The Commission voted out a draft Gas Rule today (Rm98-10/RM98-12).  Based on  the discussion, the rule contains the following major provisions:  Waiver of Capacity Release Price Caps.  A waiver of the price cap on  short-term (1 year or less) capacity release transactions through September  2002.  Hebert would have preferred a permanent removal of the price cap. Seasonal Rates.  A framework for pipelines to propose peak & off-peak rates  for short-term services.  Pipelines would make pro forma filings.  The  Commission commits to act on the filings within 60 days.  There would be a  requirement to make a cost and revenue study after 15 mo. to demonstrate  whether there are overcollections as a result of the seasonal rates.  Any  overcollections would be shared 50-50 with customers. Term Differentiated Rates.  Approval of the concept of term-differentiated  rates, subject to the requirement that a pipeline would have to make a  Section 4 filing to implement term-differentiated rates. Operational Provisions.  Scheduling/segmentation/penalty rules along the  lines set forth in the NOPR, including:  (1) equality of scheduling between  capacity release and pipeline services, (2) standardization of segmentation  rules, (3) moving away from ""command and control"" imbalance/OFO provisions in  favor of new services and better information  to manage imbalances, and (4) a  requirement to credit remaining penalty revenues. Real-time Reporting.  Transactional data would be electronically posted on a  real-time basis. Right of First Refusal.  The rule continues a ROFR for all existing long-term  contracts with the 5-year matching cap, subject to the following revisions:  (1) for future contracts, only contracts of more than 1 year at maximum rates  will have the ROFR (i.e. discount rate contracts will not enjoy ROFR), and  (2) on systems with incremental rates, a customer exercising ROFR may be  required to match the incremental rate, but these provisions will not take  effect until a pipeline has made a Section 4 filing to determine the correct  rate for ROFR on a particular system.   Not Included in the Rule.  The rule does not have a mandatory auction  requirement, although voluntary auctions are discussed. The rule does not  authorize negotiated terms.   Clarification of Certificate Policy Statement/NOPR to Eliminate Optional  Expedited Certificates The Commission proposed to eliminate OEC in favor of a single framework for  all Section 7 certificates.  During the pendency of the NOPR, OEC would still enjoy a presumption that the facilities  are in the public interest, but the factors set forth in the Policy Statement  may be used to rebut the presumption.  With respect to the Certificate Policy statement, the Commission generally  sticks with the policy in the September order.

2022-04-08 14:30:21+00:00,true,4,"  I would like to further clarify our interpretation of what happend on this  particular deal, just so that all the Enron people understand the  circumstances leading up to our losing access to these agreements.  Here's my summary/understanding of what happened:   The transportation contracts for IP/Union Camp were listed on the Exhibit  between CES and ENA as assets ENA would have rights to through March 2001.   We had an agreement with CES that if any parties would not sign agency or  assignment letters on any deals, we would paper the deal through CES, but  would still have access to the contracts.  We understood that all assets  listed on the Exhibits were assets CES owned or controlled for the term  designated on those Exhibits.  Apparently on this particular contract, CES didn't own or control the assets  for the term--they expected to continue to be the supplier past March 2000,  when its fuel supply agreement with IP ends.  However, IP adamantly refused  to allow Enron to step into CES' shoes, and elected to designate a new fuel  supplier effective April 1.  IP also controls its own transportation  agreements and those are being assigned by IP to its new supplier effective  April 1.  Consequently, ENA has no further rights and/or obligations on the  IP/Union Camp agreements past March 2000.  For Feb and March, we need to go ahead and nominate on CES' behalf, even  though IP refuses to sign any agency arrangements.  This means we really  should have a transition employee do this particular nomination--I'll leave  it up to Joan V. how to manage this.   If you have any questions, please  advise.      kjames@columbiaenergygroup.com on 02/17/2000 09:51:26 AM To: "" - *Lombardo, Fred"" <flombar@columbiaenergygroup.com> cc: "" - *Joan.Veselack@enron.com"" <Joan.Veselack@enron.com>, "" - *Flewellyn,  Melissa"" <mflewellyn@columbiaenergygroup.com>, "" - *Lombardo, Fred""  <flombar@columbiaenergygroup.com>, "" - *Chris.Germany@enron.com""  <Chris.Germany@enron.com>, "" - *Scott.Goodell@enron.com""  <Scott.Goodell@enron.com>, "" - *Colleen.Sullivan@enron.com""  <Colleen.Sullivan@enron.com>  Subject: Re: International Paper/Union Camp - PLEASE READ   Fred and everyone else on the string of E-mails I received:  OK - since I received numerous copied and forwarded E-mails on this International Paper issue, I felt it best to copy everyone.  As I understand what is going on -  CES has an obligation to deliver gas to International  Paper through March, 2000.  I agree with Colleen that CES is obligated by the terms of our agreement to purchase this gas from Enron through March, 2000.  As far as the Energy Management functions, these duties are not part of the Enron Retail contract.  The real problem that has arisen with International Paper is that they have some ill feelings towards Enron for some reason.  We have attempted to smooth this over but it appears that the gentleman at International Paper has a big burr in his saddle that I nor anyone at CES can remove.  International Paper refuses to execute any paperwork required by the pipelines to allow Enron to nominate gas.  Since this is such a short term deal, I would recommend that a CES transition employee nominate the gas and work out the logistics with Enron to get the gas to International Paper and keep them happy.  Whatever CES and Enron need to do from an accounting standpoint to make sure Enron is made  whole can be handled fairly easily I would assume.  As far as business after March, 2000, International Paper has no obligation to purchase gas from CES.  So if they do not purchase gas from CES, then Enron will not be affected after March 2000.  If International Paper does execute an extension to their gas purchase agreement or enter into a new purchase agreement then we will definitely need to get this agency problem worked out.

2022-04-08 14:35:05+00:00,true,4,"  I received word back from 4 of the 5 parties in response to my earlier notes  (both voice mails and e-mails) on: rehearing process and compliance filing agenda for the 29th native load participation and valuation  Here is the download --  Rehearing Process and Compliance Filing -- They recognized that there were  differences; however, they felt that the rehearing process and JV  formation/process provided avenues to make the needed changes.  The major  changes in the compliance filing were removal of approval rights, such as 1)  acquisition or encumbrance of a transmission asset and 2) sale or issuance of  membership interests.  Craig Baker indicated he would send a copy of the  compliance filing tomorrow.  He also indicated that they planned to file by  late today or tomorrow.  Agenda for the 29th -- The agenda seems to be in place; however, they did  indicate that they would only be able to address the wires to wires synergy  discussion in part.  They indicated that they would be able to address the  areas where savings or additional revenue would be generated but may not be  in a position to specify the financial impact (i.e., ebitda and market value  impact).  They also indicated that Andersen has all of the individual Company  numbers but not sure when the consolidated top financials will be available.   Craig Baker committed to provide an update by tomorrow morning.  I have a  call into Larry Oliva from Andersen as well.    Native Load -- The difference between our respective positions (per Craig  Baker) supports my earlier description.  Craig indicated that the Native Load  and Wholesale Network Customers are advantaged (as compared to the Firm  Point-to-Point Wholesale Customer) as a result of the filed Network  Agreement.  This allows the Network Customers to increase capacity as load  grows (potentially usurping the rollover right of a Firm Point-to-Point  Wholesale Customer).

Joe Hirl has assumed a leading  role in the formation of our business in Japan.  Joe also has regional  responsibility for trading activity.  Paul's appointment is in recognition of the critical role Paul has played in  Enron Australia's successful commencement and the body of outstanding work he  has accumulated to date in his career with Enron. It is worth noting that  Paul joined Enron as recently as the Associate intake of 1995.  In the short  time since then Paul has developed and grown through various positions to his  current Trading and Origination role, a position of great responsibility in a  dynamic young business making aggressive inroads into the Australian market,  and far from Enron's traditional US markets.

2022-04-08 18:45:32+00:00,true,4,"  Attached is additional information from CES regarding administration of the  GELP deal.  They have given us the contact at CGV to discuss the meter  reading process--Joan, can you follow up with CGV to find out how this is  going to work?  Also, Kim saved these documents in the same directory that  Joan put all the last documents in (in the GELP directory) and she has also  printed them out.  If you want hard copies, just ask her.  Just for the  record, the good news is that the winter is almost over and that seems to be  when most of the work under this contract occurs--once the summer is here  there is a back to back deal with Duke for gas supplies.  The other good news  is that it looks like you all will get the opportunity to learn quite a bit  about fuel oil.  The bad news is that there doesn't seem to be too much up  side in this deal.  The $5,000 monthly fee is about all you get unless you  can get gas to them between November and February and receive your $.05 fee  on that volume.    Anyway, CES is planning on our taking over both the GELP and CALP contracts  the first week of March.  This will give us 3 weeks of administering it and  asking all of our questions before the CES contacts are no longer there.   This means we need to very quickly decide who is going to prepare which  reports, how exactly we will handle the fuel oil deliveries (will the gas or  fuel oil guys handle this?), meter reading, contact lists, etc,   I realize  it is bid week and very difficult to get you all together, but I'd like to  have a quick meeting on Monday, February 28 at 11:00 am in Room 3125B to  discuss the GELP and CALP contracts.

2022-04-08 17:33:36+00:00,true,4,"  I have a couple of questions about the GELP contract.  First, in the  agreement's Attachment A, there are several fuel contracts agreements listed  that GELP has (or had) in place with various counterparties.  I'm wondering  what the status of these agreements is--have they expired, are they still in  place, etc.  These agreements are: Purchase Agreements:  Union Pacific Fuels--I understand that this is the Duke contract that  currently supplies GELP--Can we get a copy of this agreement?  Tejas Power Corporation--Expired ???  Columbia Energy Services Corporation dated 1/15/96 - Expired ??? Storage Agreements  Columbia Gas Transmission SIT #41825 - Status ?? Transportation Agreements  CGT-IT agreement #41828 - I'm assuming this is the agreement used to get gas  to GELP--is Duke or CES agent on this?  Commonwealth Gas Services - same question as CGT IT agreement   Note:  According to the billing calculations, it appears that the Duke  supply arrangement must have some     FT transport--whose name is that in? Other Contracts  Transco - to be acquired - Is there an IT agreement on Transco that is  used?  If so, we need contract # and is someone agent on the transport?  Also, in the GELP agreement you indicated that you get real time meter  information from a Bristol RTU.  How will ENA get this meter information?  Also, just in general--could you explain your perspective on the value  proposition in this agreement?  I understand that there is a $5000 fee you  receive each month that accompanies alot of reporting responsibilities.   Since the data you provided for last year showed very little gas deliveries  in the ""winter period"" (where you would receive $.05/MMBtu additional  compensation), there doesn't seem to be much up side value there.

This would  be met by a combination of maximizing the daily withdrawals from IBSS as well as the Directly assigned storage supplies with the remainder served by flowing gas.   On days when the firm requirement falls below the 36,774 (for March 1, our combined DSR is currently 23,758dth), I don't want to reduce IBSS withdrawals because we need to maximize those thru March in order to have that inventory down to the 35% level by March 31.  Otherwise, we could be liable  for penalties.   Instead, I would prefer to swing on the flowing gas, if necessary and keep drawing the gas out of storage.

2022-04-08 06:34:11+00:00,true,4,"  Ben, I have a reference document called Gas Turbine World Handbook in which I  look up these type of answers as well for ballpark info. They are the  ""preliminary answer"" to your question and should be treated as so. Please  keep in mind that these are numbers from a magazine, not from our internal  Performance/Cycles group under Gary Bush (within EECC). They are the dept  that the Dev Engineer typically consults with to arrive at a project's  capacity and efficiency, both from a new & clean standpoint and an average  degradation standpoint. The depts within EECC/NEPCO also come up with the  total installed costs. It is their numbers that are the ones that we  typically bid in a proforma, as such, they are a part of the deal approval  process (DASH). Their buy in is important because in addition to the numbers  that OEM's provide us, they factor in experience, judgement, unique project  characteristics, design basis, intake/exhaust losses, etc. They also look at  the net power for the Plant, not just the equipment itself. Having caveat'ed  these numbers, I would respond to your questions below as follows:  1. PG7241FA Capacity: 171,700 kW each @ generator terminals (ISO conditions,  gas fired @ baseload) -- does not include auxiliaries usage, duct losses 2. 1,060 MW Net Plant @ ISO, gas fired 3. 6,040 Btu/kWh LHV @ ISO, gas fired 4. Plug figure for GTG may be $32,500,000 each. No idea on the ST, swag at  $175/kW. Power island turnkey for 2x1 may be $375/kW (does not include alot  of stuff such as add'l options, development costs, tie-ins, permitting,  spares, etc, etc, etc)  Hope this is useful to you somehow, but please go to the source (described  above) for anything that we are going to hang our hat on.

2022-04-08 19:03:49+00:00,true,4,"  The article below describes two separate paths that EPA is considering for  regulating MTBE.  They are also considering action on a request from the  state of California to grant its request for an oxygenate waiver through  regulatory means.  Taken in conjunction with the increased interest on  Capitol Hill for moving oxygenate waiver or MTBE phase out legislation, the  future does not look very bright for MTBE.    We will continue to pursue on Capitol Hill our Enron-developed approach which  proposes stranded cost recovery and liability protection for US MTBE  producers. The House and Senate will be moving forward with hearings and  legislation shortly, and we will keep you posted on our efforts and other  developments.  ********  E&E Newsline Feb. 24,2000 Volume II, Issue 18  -------------------------------- 1. AIR POLLUTION/WATER POLLUTION --------------------------------  EPA FLOATS TWO PROPOSALS AFFECTING MTBE, REFORMULATED GASOLINE       The Environmental Protection Agency has advanced proposals dealing with the touchy issues of methyl tertiary butyl ether regulation and with the reformulated gasoline program to the White House Office of Management and Budget, and although the two proposals are being kept under wraps they have already spurred controversy and debate.       Both items were forwarded to OMB Feb. 15 and both will appear in the Federal Register probably after 90 days of OMB review, the standard time allotted for such proposals.       With neither proposal having been made public, speculation abounds about both.       The first item -- which is being reviewed by OMB as an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) -- aims to control MTBE, a synthetic ""oxygenate"" added to gasoline to lower emissions of air pollutants. The Clean Air Act mandates that certain urban areas with high levels of air pollution contain 2 percent-by-weight level of oxygenates in their gasoline in order to reduce emissions of ozone-forming hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. To comply with this reformulated gas (RFG) mandate, MTBE is relied on for over 80 percent of the gasoline, ethanol is used in almost 15 percent, and other oxygenates make up for the remaining amount.       Although MTBE has been heralded for its role in reducing air emissions, it is under attack because of environmental contamination, particularly to groundwater. In fact, both the Senate and House have plans to move legislation to allow states to waive the oxygenate mandate, and California has requested a waiver from the RFG requirements, an issue that could induce other states that have problems with MTBE contamination to take similar action.       Now, however, EPA appears poised to take action of its own. According to sources, the EPA plan would seek to control MTBE under the Toxic Substances Control Act. TSCA provides EPA the authority to prohibit certain chemicals or substances if the agency concludes it ""presents or will present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.""       ""MTBE clearly meets this test,"" claimed Sen. Barbara Boxer (D- Calif.), who has in the past fought to have MTBE phased out.       However, Terry Wigglesworth, executive director of the Oxygenated Fuels Association, which represents MTBE producers, argued otherwise. ""TSCA is not a good technical choice,"" she said of EPA's proposal. Among the hurdles EPA will face with the proposal, she predicted, is that under TSCA, EPA must look at the risks to human health and the environment, ""but there are enormous air quality benefits due to MTBE use, for example there have been significant reductions in ozone and air toxic emissions, such as benzene.""       ""Also under TSCA, EPA must determine if the risk could be reduced by other federal laws already being administered,"" she explained, pointing specifically to the underground storage tank program, which she said has not been complied with too well.       In a Feb. 22 letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner, Boxer said, ""Some critics of this approach argue that MTBE contamination may be controlled by upgrading our underground storage tanks. This won't solve the MTBE problem, however, because we now know that even those new tanks leak."" She also said, ""MTBE poses a more pervasive water contamination problem than the other harmful constituents of gasoline like benzene because it moves through water faster, farther and persists longer than those constituents.""       Whether EPA's proposal would entail banning, phasing out or capping MTBE use is unclear and was disputed among various sources. However, one industry source said that EPA was not taking a stance on that issue and would first take public comment through the ANPR and proposed rule.       Although sources indicated that the ANPR would not typically be printed in the Federal Register until the 90-day review period has expired, ""We heard EPA asked OMB to fast track it,"" one industry source said. And a federal government source also hinted that the proposal would be reviewed very quickly.       The second proposal is shrouded in even more ambiguity. What is certain is that the proposal would entail an ""adjustment"" to RFG, as stated by an OMB source.       Environmental and industry sources said that the hints they've gotten indicate that the proposal entails an offset for carbon monoxide. According to these sources, EPA has discussed this option with stakeholders in the past.       Under the proposal, certain RFG provisions concerning emissions of volatile organic compounds would be loosened as long as there were significant reductions in CO emissions. VOCs are blamed for ozone production, and carbon monoxide also contributes to ozone.       According to an environmentalist, this proposal would encourage increased reliance on ethanol by refineries.       Wigglesworth spoke against this proposal, saying, ""Any loosening of requirements to maintain actual air quality benefits that we've achieved through cleaner burning gasoline that would turn back the clock on cleaner air or air quality would be unacceptable.""","The article below describes two separate paths that EPA is considering for regulating MTBE.

2022-04-08 15:13:18+00:00,true,4,"  We are approaching February 29, 2000, which is generally regarded as the  second most critical Year 2000 rollover date, second only to the millennium  rollover.  A year divisible by 100 is not a leap year, unless it is divisible  by 400.  As a consequence, some applications that were programmed incorrectly  will believe the date is March 1, which may cause system errors.  During the millennium rollover Enron encountered Y2K related issues only with  the bottom tier of applications and embedded systems that were ranked as  ""ordinary"" or ""low"" in our triage processes.  The problems that did arise  were few and were quickly fixed.  This is exactly what we were planning for  and is a testament to a job done exceptionally well by all.    In consideration of the few and minor problems Enron encountered on January  1, 2000, our procedures for the 29th will be curtailed.  The goals for this  period are to validate that all mission critical applications and embedded  systems are functioning normally and to ensure that all problems are reported  through the project office.  We are not planning to reopen the Millennium  Management Center nor do we plan to operate outside of normal business hours.  Please ensure that each group that reported to you for the millennium  rollover run through the same Y2K checklists for critical systems.  For this  exercise, however, we anticipate them reporting back to you on an exception  basis only.  If problems do occur, the nature, details and planned ready dates should be  forwarded to Andrew Parsons (713 853-6665) or Bob Johansen (713 853-6842),  who will report to management and monitor events.

So this attachment outlines those  items outside of ""common design"" that Wanda and Sally  probably want covered  from an ENA perspective.  As a rule of thumb, this proposed scope equates to  $100k - $150k in fees to AA that is over & above the audit budget.  One word of advice:  Designate a lead within ENA that has the time to stay on  top of the project, schedule meetings with AA, and coordinate their  involvement with the SAP team members, e.g. not Wanda or Sally, but at a  director/manager level at least.  I was the designee for Corp and ensured  that AA kept the project going.  Also, I worked extensively with the Janet  Tran, SAP lead director responsible for bringing Corp up.  Some big benefits: Kept AA out of SAP's hair when things got rough.

As soon as we get VOM from EE&CC,  we will ask Structuring group to get the capacity payment for 3 and 5 years.  3. Things to be done  - 3 and 5 year capacity payment to get 8.5% ~ 9% IRR of unlevered equity  - 20 year power curve (capacity and energy) for Eastern PJM. We got gas  curve.  - VOM  I think this idea could be good if Calpine is willing to pay more than what  we see for next 3 or 5 year Eastern PJM pool price, and/or we can leverage up  more by taking advantage of 3 or 5 year tolling agreement. This is just my  thought. Please correct me, if I am wrong. I will continue to work on the  model with Ben and I will talk to Scott to find out more. Thank you.  Jinsung Myung     ","Thomas, I talked to Scott shortly this afternoon. I was confused between his idea and Ben's model. As it is clear from Scott's proposal letter to Calpine, Enron would enter into a short-term tolling agreement to buy power from Calpine. The key value driver"

2022-04-08 06:30:27+00:00,true,4,"  My several hours of on-line research on this last Sept. turned up nothing on  point.  The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of  contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here:  **  In Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C., 80 FERC P 61,346 (1997),  Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it  submitted. Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that  Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential.  Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off  dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such  information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes  requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept  confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years  public. Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for  confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market  support for new facilities. [FN30] However, in the instance case, the  contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of  longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and  support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed  services. Therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of  the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made  public.   FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could  terminate contingent on the occurrence of certain events.  FN30 See, e.g., Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 76 FERC P 61,291 (1996). **  In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V. Natural Gas  Pipeline Company of America, 82 FERC P 61,037 (1998), which involved a  request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the Commission  explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment  but transportation contracts should not:    the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a  different footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are  subject to similar disclosure requirements. In ANR Pipeline Co., the Commission explained that unlike gas  sales in a competitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under  the assumption that the pipeline exercises market power. Even where transportation competition exists, that  competition is from other pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting  requirements.   There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the  context of Section 4 cases.    Just to make sure I found everything, I'll do some follow up sometime in the  next few days and let you know if I find anything.

2022-04-08 19:22:41+00:00,true,4,"  Just wanted to catch you up on the events over the past week....and a couple  of things I want to talk to you about next week  REPORTING: It has been a continual challenge as you well know.  The good news is the  individual from EES (Chris Luttrell) accepted Jay's offer today and he is  going to start on March 3.   That said, I talked to Chris today and filled him in on where we are and what  we want to accomplish.  He feels our best option will be Oracle.   To ensure we are prepared for his arrival next Monday, we are preparing the  detail of what we are doing today, both our assumptions and all of the  various data sources for our current management reporting Also, Dave and I met with Wanda and Georgeanne on Tuesday regarding revenue.   I believe Dave sent you an update of this meeting.  We are meeting with  Georgeanne today to go over our assumptions, conversions, etc. to ensure that  we are consistent with those conversations in the annual report, and to  ensure that we are capturing all of the Enron data Customer database - we have been fine tuning this all week, and I think we  are about there.  There are still some minor differences, but we are working  to sort through these today (everyone is involved in the tie out).  I will  review the new report format with you on Monday and we will start sending  this out then. We also have an Access person that is working on improving our current  database since we will have to live with this in the short term.  TRADING ACTIVITY: It seems that we are seeing an increase in customers wanting to modify EOL  deals for various reasons (one being Web latency...they are claiming that the  deal did not show up on their transaction summary, so they thought it did not  go through, and they did another deal...and this first deal appeared sometime  later).  We have continued to emphasize the importance of not changing these  deals after they are completed, but despite this, it is still happening.  I  am going to try and track down Jeff Shankman this afternoon to discuss. We are also seeing more and more customers trading under the wrong  entities...for example, Aquila Risk Mgmt is executing physical deals, when  they should be only executing financial deals.  From my understanding, we  have ""left the door open"" for them to trade either way and are relying on  them to trade under the correct counterparty.  This is causing several  problems downstream..for instance, customers are wanting ENA to send modified  invoices with the name of the correct counterparty (despite the fact that  they were the ones transacting under the wrong entity).   We need to discuss  how leaving this door open affects our downstream processes.  OTHER: I talked to both Dave and Bob yesterday to ensure that we were in the loop on  new products, etc. to ensure that we are better prepared for the launch of  new products (e.g. Credit Derivatives).   Help desk news...Matt M. accepted a position with the Remedy development  team.  We are going to move Noel (he works nights) to the day shift to take  over Matt's role.  Donna assures me that he is very good.  Sandy Rivas also  wants to leave the group.  We should be able to handle the volume of calls  without replacing them.  I need to go over some call statistics with you next  week.  We have not received one phone call from a customer on the weekends,  and we receive less than .1 calls per hour between the hours of  7pm to  midnight.  I think we can get away with eliminating weekends, and using on  call pagers from 7 to midnight. One question - we currently are considering EES an external counterparty and  Enron Canada an internal counterparty.  We are now trading with Bridgeline  Gas Marketing (joint venture with Texaco - 40% ownership).  We need to  determine what we are considering internal vs external.   I would think these  would be external due to the fact that these are settled transactions...  any  thoughts?  I know this is a lot of info, but I also know you are going to be in high  demand on Monday!  I hope you are enjoying your ski trip!!!

2022-04-08 17:39:17+00:00,true,4,"  Dana, per the note you printed out and gave me.  CES gave Enron a riskworks data dump which had not been audited for correct  pricing at CES. As you know GMS was used at CES for scheduling and billing.  This Dayton Deal was not input into Sitara. I created this deal ticket for  volume/position not for pricing. Somebody on the CES transition team was  suppose to verify pricing on all Northeast Deals that was input into Sitara.  Printout of all Sitara deals was given to Phil Glaessner on January 19th.  Paul Drexelius met with Scott Goodell and Chris Germany on February 8th to  verify the pricing on these deals. Not sure how far Scott and Chris have  gotten to correct the pricing on these deals starting with January 2000.   Don't mean to pass the buck... but please check with Scott and Chris.  The GMS deal numbers are;  s-dp&L-0070 for 5000/day from 12/1/98 to 5/1/2001 s-dp&l-0079 for 5000/day from 12/1/99 to 5/1/2000  I'm guessing the correct pricing exists on these GMS deal tickets and someone  needs to correct the pricing on the Sitara deals.

2022-04-08 04:44:11+00:00,true,4,"  Lindy -- I'm working on a checklist. There were just a couple of issues arising from the discussions with market  services, weren't there? One having to do with whether we want to change our 68 A to reflect FTS-1 and  FTS-3 in same bucket -- I'm leaning towards not changing since the language  is already general enough to cover us there. The other issue had to do with issuing the OFO if EFBH does not show up in  the last cycle.  I do not believe any changes are necessary there either.   The tariff language as it's currently written says we ""shall"" issue an OFO,  and we would, but an OFO issued in the last cycle would simply be a formality  and the EFBH shipper would have no choice but to pay the penalty. If you see any roadblocks on these 2 tariff sheets (27A and 68A), or if there  are any other issues we need to address, let me know.  Also, if you want to  sit down and go thru my checklist together sometime tomorrow, or even later  this afternoon, I'm available. Thanks! S.

Marketing does not anticipate offering  the service until March 1, 2000.  Susan is working on the compliance tariff sheets right now to be filed 15  days after the Order is issued (the Draft Order was issued last Thursday, so  the final Order should be issued within a couple days after that).  The  change I think you're referring to is the way we had anticipated prorating  FTS-1 & FTS-3 together when FBH is showing-up and now, we actually will match  FTS-3 with the FBH space and FTS-1 will be allocated ""existing"" space as  usual.  Susan is looking at the tariff language now and is thinking a  language change may not be necessary.  She will be discussing with Mary Kay.   Regardless of which decision, it's being addressed.  Were there any other tariff language changes? (I know FTS-3 should be added  to 22.2, D, 1.  Susan and Mary Darveaux are reviewing all the GT&C's to check  for where FTS-3 &/or FBH should be referenced, etc.)  Please let me know.  Thanks!

The only remaining issues when we're done will  relate to the curves.  Just so we're all on the same page, I thought I would lay out the base  scenario:  Hourly vols Mid power and oil curves Beginning debt of $375/kw amortising mortgage style over 20-years Debt interest rates of T+225 Plant residual value of $100/kw Enron will own a 50 MW call from 5/2001 to 12/31/2020.  Strike prices will be  $50/mwh for years 1-5, $75/mwh for years 6-10, and $100/mwh for the balance  of the term. The basic put or no put trigger algorithm is (plant value + put option value  >= par amount of bonds outstanding).  As the model calculates equity's  decision whether or not to put the plant to Enron, we should reduce each  years par amount of bonds outstanding by the debt service reserve fund.  This  proxy's the fact that equity will consider when making their put decision  each year that there are moneys in the DSRF, working capital reserves and  equity sweep accounts. Whatever power/oil correlation's structuring thinks are appropriate.  I hope to see results Monday.  If there are any questions, please call me at  3-4750.  regards,  Don Black","Team, We've done a lot of good work lately on the evaluation models and I think we are converging on a platform that accurately models the product, the project and the structures that are at risk.

I'm not sure how to answer you question.  For some reason, when the CES deals  were input into ENRON's system, someone decided to put each tier of a deal  into Sitara as a seperate deal.  Therefore, instead of having one deal with  tiered prices to path, there are multiple deals to be pathed for the same  counterparty (ie the same deal).  I would like to talk to whomever is in charge and suggest that where  possible, only one deal with tiered prices appear in Sitara.  Since there are multiple deals instead of tiered pricing for JD Drilling ,  Power Gas , Riley & Scot and Viking Energy, you will most likely need to path  each deal seperately unless someone decides that only one deal with tiered  prices is appropriate.  If anyone is interested, I would gladly provide the information necessary to  set up single deals with tiered pricing.   It would also be helpful to have a report which would show the Sitara deals  by counterparty. This would facilitate creating single deals with tiered  pricing where applicable.  John  ","John, I'm sorry my question was not clear. Please advise which Sitara deal tickets you want changed to match the spreadsheet volumes.

2022-04-08 23:50:45+00:00,false,5,"  As you know, current firm contracts on Transwestern provide for delivery of  250 MMcf/d of gas to Topock.  In the context of the Gallup Expansion,  Transwestern has entered into firm contracts for an additional 40 MMcf/d to  Topock.  Once the Gallup expansion is built, Transwestern will have a total  of 290 MMcf/d of firm capacity under contract to the Topock delivery point:   40 MMcf/d more than PG&E has agreed to accept while PCBs continue to be  present.  Bill Cordes has asked what Transwestern's potential liability to shippers  would be if PG&E's refusal to accept deliveries due to the continued presence  of contaminants causes Transwestern to have to curtail firm service at  PG&E/Topock.  The legal answer is that Transwestern's tariff provides for a  reservation charge refund but does not limit the damages that could be sought  by a shipper.    More specifically, Rate Schedule FTS-1 specifically provides for a  reservation charge refund if Transwestern fails to deliver gas for a firm  shipper.  In December, January, February, July and August, the shipper is  entitled to a reservation charge refund for all nominated and confirmed  quantities not delivered.  In all other months, the shipper is entitled to a  refund only if deliveries fall below 75% of nominated/confirmed quantities  for a period of 75 consecutive days. The tariff does not preclude a shipper  from seeking other damages resulting from Transwestern's failure to provide  service under an FTS-1 contract.  A shipper whose firm service is curtailed  would likely incur damages in addition to the reservation charge, including,  for example, the cost of buying spot gas or damages resulting from the  shipper's inability to fulfill contractual obligations. Such damages could be  recovered in a breach of contract action.  Not all shippers would incur such  damages because some might be willing to take delivery of gas at alternate  points if capacity is available at such points.  Bill has asked Steve to work with me in quantifying our potential exposure.   I could really use your help in putting a dollar amount on potential  damages.  Can we meet briefly to discuss this?  I'm available after the  Gallup meeting tomorrow a.m., or after lunch on Friday...or we can discuss a  meeting time for next week.

2022-04-08 10:11:08+00:00,false,5,"  The reservation charge reduction applicable to TW's failure to deliver gas  under certain circumstances does NOT apply to either force majeure events or  periods of unscheduled maintenance less than 10 days in any calendar  quarter.  Unscheduled maintenance is defined as unanticipated or unplanned  maintenance on the pipeline system required to be performed to ensure that  gas continues to flow in months other than Dec., Jan., Feb., July and Aug.    Assuming we could even classify the proposed activity as ""maintenance,"" I'm  not sure we could get away with saying it was unanticipated or unplanned, as  the Gallup expansion has been in the works for some time.  I am also not  completely comfortable calling this ""force majeure"" because part of the  tariff definition is that the event was not within the control of either  party; however, since the definition does include ""binding order of any court  or governmental authority,"" we could possibly say this is force majeure if  we're reducing the pressure in order to comply with a DOT pipeline safety  rule.  (In that event, our notice on the EBB would be a force majeure  notice.)  If not, we can argue that since this is not ""maintenance,"" but  simply being done to construct the expansion in a safe and prudent manner,  the shippers' rights are not triggered under the reservation charge reduction  provisions.  In that case, damages (if any) would have to be pursued under  ordinary contract law.    I realize that this is not a very satisfactory answer; however, the outage is  going to be relatively short, and no shipper in recent memory has availed  itself of the reservation charge reduction.  I recommend we give shippers  reasonable notice of the pressure reduction so that they can make alternate  plans -- this will reduce the likelihood that they will feel revengeful.

One of the benefits of this system is to  allow all customers access to the market prices rather than being funnelled  through third party brokers.    Enron has committed to providing both depth of volume and tight bid/offer  spreads. This committment has been main driver of the growth in volume since  rollout last Nov.29.   Transparency  The existence of our two way market has removed all doubt about the firmness  of bids and offers.  We will trade on the price and volume on our bid and  offer.   The growing volumes over our system has lessened our dependance on  the sometimes unreliable broker served market.  Many of our customers and  competitors now use EOL as an information source as well as a trading  vehicle.  EOL is the only service that provides free real time information on  as many traded markets in the physical and financial worlds.  We have no  competition in this regard.  This aspect of EOL has been helpful to the  smaller customers that are not primarily trading operations.    Deal Flow  As the market maker on this system we do derive some tangible trading  benefits.  We are collecting the bid/offer spread on our transactions and  over time this results in a direct bottom line benefit.    Enron's market  share of financial tranactions will also increase overtime as we have become  the easiest and most reliable way to transact in the market.               ,"US Gas Liquidity EOL allows Enron to simultaneously provide internal and external customers with realtime markets on many of the physical and financial products that we trade.

2022-04-08 07:58:34+00:00,true,6,"  Jeff,  Below is a list of items I'd like to discuss with you when we both have  time(?).  I just wanted to brief you first.  I'm thinking about having a meeting with the basis traders every morning from  8:15 - 8:30 after each trader has gathered information from their desk  meetings.  This would be the optimal time to strategize as a group since  changes in regional fundamentals and respective basis implications would be  fresh in everyone's mind.  Would it be okay to delay EOL market-making in  basis until 8:30?  I think it would be worth it. I think it would be a good idea to meet with leaders from other groups  (origination (who?), structuring (who?), Julie Gomez, and Fred Lagrasta) on a  regular basis to obtain new information on anything that might affect ENA's  basis positions.  Could you point me in the right direction as far as whom to  involve and maybe notify them of my intentions? Should we set up a new book (under my management) which would hold certain  strategic positions such as spread trades and/or more complex structured  positions?  I think it would be easier to manage that way by not being  ""cluttered up"" in different books (i.e.  the P/L from these trades would be  my focus instead of managed by other traders.)   Do you think the traders could eventually report directly to me?  It seems  like more intense leadership might provide an extra push to the group.  Talk to you soon,  Fletch","Jeff, Below is a list of items I'd like to discuss with you when we both have time(?). I just wanted to brief you first.
