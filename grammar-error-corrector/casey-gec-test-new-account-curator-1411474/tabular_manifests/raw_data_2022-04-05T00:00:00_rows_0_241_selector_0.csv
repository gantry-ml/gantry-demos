Lindsey, et al:  Attached is PG&E's revised OFO Settlement Agreement based on our discussion and agreements at yesterday's Settlement Conference.  Before getting into the details, I want to thank Lindsey and the other active parties for their diligence and willingness to negotiate constructively in order to reach consensus.  The following highlights the changes, which are shown as revision-marks against our September 24 proposal. We've added a couple of ""clean-up"" changes not specifically addressed yesterday.  I don't believe these should cause any problem. * ""Significantly"" is added under A. and B.1. * In section B.1, we have inserted the term ""Gas OFO Forum"" so when we talk about this forum outside the settlement, it has a specific name we all recognize and agree to.  We have made changes elsewhere in the document to include this more formal title.  We also included ""or customer"" as being able to join the Forum. * In B.2, we used the words provided yesterday by the parties with two exceptions:  * First, the language was revised to make a six-month comparison of OFO reductions, rather than a quarterly comparison as we agreed, and  * Second, we added the word ""other"" to modify ""members"" in two places so it is clear that PG&E is also a member of the Forum. * In B.3, we changed the term ""Settlement Parties"" to ""Gas OFO Forum"" to reflect the intent of the agreement. * In B.4, we added the sentence at the end as requested, but, per our discussion, did not remove our last sentence.  We added more specific language on the balancing account to be clearer, and noted that this issue is not fully resolved pending feedback from a couple parties. * In C.1.g, we used the language provided, removing the one sentence as agreed, and we added a comma and an ""a"" in the last sentence. * We did not include the proposed change from the parties for C.1.f.(3) for more data, since per yesterday's discussion we already agreed to provide that data elsewhere. * In C.3.b.(7), we modified the language to reflect our discussion that we would use a 100% Performance Factor for the first customer-specific OFO, and then an average of the actual performance for subsequent customer-specific OFOs, but not less than 50%.  We also agree to post the performance data and revised factor within 14 days of each customer-specific OFO, and if another customer-specific OFO is needed in that period, to use the prior factor.  We also changed ""Settlement Parties"" to the ""Gas OFO Forum.""  Lastly, we changed the ""next session"" to ""an ongoing basis"" which better fits the continuous nature of the data and adjustments. * In C.4.a, although not discussed the group at the Settlement Conference, Ron Oechsler, on behalf of Palo Alto, pointed out that our description of the three days when cashouts were driven by market economics was not quite correct.  We have reviewed his comment and concur, and have corrected the wording accordingly.  This does not change this provision to modify the cash-out prices. * In C.5.e.(4), we added the monthly election option. * In D.3.c, we added the suggested language, but changed ""Settlement Parties"" to the ""Gas OFO Forum."" * On Appendix A, Revised Tariffs, we added the new balancing account which would be part of the Preliminary Statement in PG&E's gas tariffs.  We will send you a draft of this tariff sheet with the full package next week.  With the one loose end regarding the balancing account language, we believe that this document reflects our agreement with the parties.  We will follow up with the motion, tariffs, and final settlement agreement after confirming with Lindsey that we have captured yesterday's discussion accurately.  Again, thanks for all your active participation and support for getting this Settlement completed.

2022-04-05 14:23:30+00:00,true,4,"          Not Such a Capital Idea          by Brad De Long and David Levine          Appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle, December 5, 1995, p. A23.           In the 1980s Republicans argued that the tax cuts they proposed would make the economy grow faster because the rich would redirect energy from avoiding taxes to entrepreneurship. Unfortunately, the theory was wrong. The most optimistic serious assessment of the effects from the 1981 tax cuts (by supply-sider Larry Lindsay) show supplyside benefits of the tax cut far lower than the burden of the debt they generated.          Now Republicans are again proposing tax cuts. Today skepticism infects even the core of the Republican coalition. The Wall Street Journal's editorial pages attacked the tax cuts as being the kind that former Democratic Congressman Rostenkowski might have producedsurely the worst insult they can imagine. Principled Republican economic advisers are silent. There is not even a theory under which the Republicans' capital gains tax cut, child credit, and increase in taxes on families that qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) could boost growth.          Start with the capital gains tax cut. It provides no incentives to boost investment. No manager deciding whether to build a factory, buy a computer, or engage in research and development changes his or her calculation of expected profit because of a reduction in capital gains taxes.          Some proponents believe the tax cut will boost investment and growth indirectly by increasing savings. They note that the tax cut raises the aftertax returns on savings placed in risky assets such as shares of stock. They then claim higher returns on these assets will, in turn, induce higher savings. Higher savings will drive down interest rates, which in turn, will raise business investment and growth.          But this roundabout chain of cause and effect falls apart at the first touch. Both the capital gains tax rate and the after-tax return to savings  have wandered all over the place in the past generation. Private savings have  barely shifted in response. Thus, each dollar of tax cuts increases private savings  by less than a dollar. The net effect of the tax cut is to lower the pool of national savings available to fund investment.  Continued hope that lowering tax rates will boost American savings and investment is the triumph of faith over experience.          The problem is that this tax cut provides an enormous windfall gain to those who have unrealized capital gains on assets they acquired in the past. The top one percent of American families with unrealized capital gains hold about half of these unrealized gains.  While many people realize a small  amount of capital gains in any given year, these few families hold trillions of dollars of unrealized gains. Good tax policies provide incentives for people  to work, save, and invest. Bad tax policies reward a wealthy few for decisions they made in the past.          A capital gains tax cut may well raise revenue in its first year or two, as people liquidate their unrealized gains before the next increase in capital gains rates. But once the first wave of selling is over, a standard guess is that the capital gains tax cut will cost about $20 billion a year. When the government decides to spend $20 billion a year on a tax incentive, shouldn't  it choose one likely to boost economic growth for everyone? And shouldn't it be part of a package that avoids further tilting our distribution of income in an unhealthy direction?          The overall effect of the Republican tax proposals on the distribution of income gives the impression that the congressional majority is waging a onesided class war: the cuts in the Earned Income Tax Credit and the details  of how the child credit is paid add up to roughly $2.2 billion a year in tax increases on families with annual incomes less than $30,000, and tax decreases of some $2.8 billion$7,000 or so per familyon those with incomes of more than $200,000.          Early in the nineteenth century, Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in the introduction to Democracy in America of ""equality of conditions as the  creative element"" that made America great. This substantial ""equality of conditions""  was under threat once, in the generation of the Gilded Age, and almost turned America into a very different and worse country. This year's tax changes are another step in a series that places it under threat again.         Brad De Long and David Levine teach economics and business at the University of California, Berkeley.    Addendum:         Due to space constraints, the editorial omitted three (sometimes offsetting) issues concerning how the capital gains tax treats time.  The capital gains tax over-taxes gains because it taxes nominal gains, including gains that are due solely to inflation.  Thus, if inflation doubles average prices over a decade, someone who sells an asset that also doubles in nominal value will face taxation although the asset's real value was constant.         The capital gains tax under-taxes gains because the tax on unrealized gains is not collected until a sale. This delay is like the federal government lending the value of the uncollected tax at zero interest; at low inflation  the under-taxation due to value of this loan is usually larger than the over-taxation due to the first effect.         Moreover, if the person dies holding the gain, the tax on unrealized gains is forgiven -- a somewhat bizarre feature of the tax system.  This  latter feature makes the tax ineffective at collecting revenue from the very wealthy, who merely delay sales of their appreciated assets.         A better capital gain tax should tax only real gains, should not forgive taxes on inherited unrealized gains, and (this is trickier) should try to minimize the value of lost tax due to holding appreciated assets.

2022-04-05 13:26:17+00:00,true,4,"  Jeff - another issue for you to sink your teeth into.  You may be aware that at San Jose we recently installed a bi-directional  meter to accommodate the PG&E power purchase agreement (PPA,sell to grid) and  the regular intake off the grid. As we positioned ourselves to be the 'buy and sell' MDMA, PG&E has informed  us, and SJSU, that the PPA stipulates that only PG&E meter data can be used  to determine power purchase payments. The PG&E ESP Relations Department has  internally protested this arrangement but the PG&E lawyers apparently  prevailed.  Since PG&E was not clear on this during the meter installation arrangement,  PG&E has now decided to disconnect the outflow channel of the customer-owned  meter and install its own meter at PG&E expense. This is a ludicrous but workable solution. Until the PG&E meter is installed,  our webpage info will be used to determine the payments to SJSU.  We are currently discussing a similar meter installation at Santa Cruz, and I  am sure that others will follow on sites where customers have generation. We  need to convince PG&E that customer-owned meters are just as good if not  better than their meters and that their position is arcane. Will this be  covered in the current proceedings before the CPUC?

2022-04-05 04:43:14+00:00,true,4,"  I have attached a memo from Don Black regarding his meeting with Duke  yesterday. As you will note,this memo outlines the factual differences  between the parties. The legal issue is one straight out of first year  Contracts class: Was there a meeting of the minds so as to create a binding  contract? When I first looked at this I was somewhat concerned. In response  to an email from Duke describing a particular index pricing, Julian responded  simply ""I agree."" But after talking to Don, Greg Whalley ,reviewing all the  email correspondence, and, most importantly, listening to the trader tapes, I  am convinced that Julian never agreed to the index that Duke is alleging. In  other words I think we can make a good argument to get around  the damaging ""  I agree"" email. It is clear that Duke's trader didn't, and probably still  doesn't understand what index she was usingin her email. The Master Agreement  provides for arbitration in Houston with three arbitrators, one of whom must  have 8 years of experience in derivatives. I'll take my chances with that  kind of panel. I estimate our liklihood of prevailing is in the 70-80% range.  Let me know if you need anything further.  ","I have attached a memo from Don Black regarding his meeting with Duke yesterday.

2022-04-05 04:47:01+00:00,true,4,"  Sara,  I hope you are having a good vacation and are not looking at your emails  until you return.  I just wanted to get you up to date on a couple of items.    Bolivia--Randy asked if we have ever done any research on whether we could do  derivatives in Bolivia.  I told him I thought we had checked on this and  determined that Bolivia was not one of the countries that  had been surveyed,  but that I would check with you to be sure.  I think he is asking since we  are looking at doing physical deals there and the next thing the business  guys always want to do is financial trades.    Colombia--There is a new group of commercial guys who want to do electricity  trading (and gas trading???) in Colombia.  I have passed this request on to  Mark who is looking at it.  I think we will run into the same problems we had  last year with the gas trading proposal.  Susan Baily found the Colombia  financial and physical trading survey for me to give to Mark and I faxed some  other memos I found in my files here.  There is a lot of memos on structures  that had to do with the earlier trading vehicles and joint ventures which I  did not send.  I also did not send the memos relating to our efforts to get  financial trading allowed.  Bob Carter worked a lot on that issue but the  commercial interest died before we saw any tangible results with the Colombia  political process.  Brazil--Don lobbed a bomb last week to Randy and then casually mentioned it  to me after the fact.  Don asked Randy to set up a swap vehicle in Brazil so  that Don can do his financial trading with Argentina from Brazil.  This is  some speculation on my part but I think Don doesn't like the current  structure of having to run his financial trades with Argentine counterparties  through Houston.  He does not have the ability to direct and control the  process of negotiating and trading for Argentina through ENA which is  problematic for him since for tax reasons we are telling him anything of  substance has to come from ENA in Houston.  Don asked Randy, who asked Andrea  Bertone, to set up a swap vehicle in Brazil to trade with Argentine  counterparties.  Obviously Don could control the negotiating and trading from  Brazil and his operational problem is solved.  As you know this may create a  whole host of other problems that cannot be solved as easily.  I will discuss  with Andrea today my initial thoughts on the issues raised by this  proposal.   First the tax issues may make Brazil a difficult place to make  any money on a trading operation, tax will need to be brought in first thing  to analyse the structure.  Second, we may not be able to trade cross border  swaps without regulatory problems, we will need to speak with Antonio Felix  and others at Tozzini to start reviewing the structure.  Third, there may be  significant currency issues involved that need to be reviewed at the same  time we look at the tax and regulatory issues.  If we are able to overcome  these issues then we will need to review the substantial legal and  operational issues raised by such a structure.  The ISDA agreement, which  would be in English, would need to be reviewed by local counsel to ensure  that all of the substantive provisions including arbitration, limitation of  liability and collateral structures would be enforceable in Brazil when  entered into with Argentine counterparties.  Operational issues such as who  will be responsible for the negotiation of masters, drafting of confirmations  etc. would also need to be addressed.   Argentina--I think the Acindar swap issue has gone away.  Pat emailed though  that they are now looking at an option structure.  I do not know what they  mean by ""option"" or what the new structure would be.  I will let you know  what I find out.  Call when you get back and I can update you on where things stand.

Further, as PG&E insisted on the bi-directional  meter, PG&E ought to pick up the incremental cost of that device versus a  standard meter. Then, once the PG&E meter has been installed (Steve thinks  there is a meter location left on the board), we will need to reprogram the  meter for which PG&E will be charged.

2022-04-05 03:46:40+00:00,true,4,"  The question is legitimate.  With the potential for exchanges among  affiliates being very real, the only possible solution is to either prohibit  affiliate participation or make iron-clad the confidentiality/non-disclosure  agreement.  Of course, once you allow the affiliate to participate, being  able to determine if an ""inappropriate"" transfer of information has occurred  is almost impossible.  The other problem is that Enron has been an advocate  of affiliate participation in the sale of assets, as long as the relationship  was arms-length and no preferential treatment was provided.  As proposed,  PG&E states that its affiliate will be treated the same as other bidders.   So, I think that leaves us with buttressing the proposed confidentiality  language to prevent such exchanges as much as possible.  We would also have to assume, for the information to be beneficial to PG&E's  affiliate, that it would result in PG&E Gen obtaining the assets.  As  proposed by PG&E, they would have to be the highest bidder, taking into  consideration certain tax benefits associated with the sale to an affiliate  (PG&E's proposal, not my assessment).  In other words, PG&E claims that the  ultimate determination of the winning bidder is price.  If the result was  that PG&E Gen paid more for these assets than anyone else, it becomes a  little more difficult to claim that the auction was unfair.    However, I believe that the ultimate determination is price, with a caveat.   The caveat is acceptance by PG&E of amendments to the attached service  agreements.  PG&E allows for bidders to submit amendments to the service  agreements, but PG&E retains the right to reject the amendments if not  acceptable to them.  PG&E Gen may know what amendments are and are not  acceptable.  That may be the inside track for the affiliate.  But again, I  think it brings us back to ensuring equitable treatment as much as possible  in the auction protocol rather than preventing PG&E Gen from participating.  If you feel this is not adequate, please let me know.

DG Consumer Education  I believe this is  a fairly comprehensive list.  However, there are some  issues that I believe should either be identified or if already identified   better defined.  First, in the Energy Division's assessment of Energy  Competition and the clear separation of monopoly and competitive services,  the Energy Division should identify all of the assymetric rules,  responsibilities, and expectations placed upon ESPs compared to those of the  UDC default service provider.  For instance, hourly interval metering  requirements only apply to direct access customers and not to standard offer  customers.  Costs to fulfill regulatory requirements by the ESP are expected  to be recovered from market transactions; whereas, the utilities recover  these costs in non-competitive service rates.  These are examples of  competitive barriers that disadvantage ESPs.  Secondly, the decisions  reference to Standby Service on page 17 inappropriate implies that Standby  Service is only available from the UDC, when in fact ESPs can supply Standby  Generation Service as well.  The issue of Standby Service needs to unbundle  Standby T&D service from Standby Generation service, where these two issues  are looked at independently.  Third,  in addressing the Distributed  Generation issue of distribution service for excess generation the issue of  bidirectional distribution service needs to be more fully explored.  In other  words, if the customer is expected to pay for distribution service as a load,  some of the costs of distribution service for excess generation should be  offset by the payments already paid for distribution charges to the load.   Fourth, the issue of voltage service levels is in part addressed with respect  to interconnection.  Discounts for voltage service levels should be addressed  with respect to both loads and generation.  Finally, the issue of  interruptible service should also be addressed, because it is an unresolved  issue that is related to the issues above about distribution system benefits.

2022-04-05 04:08:45+00:00,true,4,"  Thanks Mona, good summary.  I would like to discuss making the following  proposals to the commission:  1)  Require PG&E to submit their evaluation criteria and weighting in advance  of the auction.  This will help eliminate any subjectivity that favors their  affiliate.  If the commission is interested in a fair auction with no  preference given to pge gen, this request should be hard to argue with.  It  may also give us information about how they will try to move this process in  pge gen's favor.  It also gives us a platform to debate the auction process  and gain some additional concessions.  2)  Propose that any negative tax ramifications for ratepayers and state  residents resulting from a sale to the affiliate should be factored out of  the affiliate's bid.  This will create a more level playing field and  maximize the value to ratepayers.  We may want to get Arthur Anderson  involved in helping with this assessment.  3)  Have the bids independently evaluated by one or more third parties  selected by consensus of the interested parties.  Also, are there any market power issues with the affiliate owning this much  generation in the utility service area?  How could the affiliate  theoretically abuse this generation to benefit the utility or PG&E corp?   These issues should also be highlighted in any filing.   The outcome of this auction is extremely important to EES.  We stand to make  considerably more money the higher the sale price.  From my perspective, it's  a top priority for us to apply whatever resources are needed to ensure a fair  auction.  The other factor to consider is time, which works against us.  I would appreciate discussing our plan of action in this proceeding.  If we  need to develop a plan, we are more than happy to help.

2022-04-05 09:37:49+00:00,true,4,"  Sorry, I did not realize you were awaiting a response from me on this.  Our deal is with the subsidiary, not the parent.  So the name of the  counterparty should be Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc., (CCSI) not  Catalytica.  Regarding the credit issue (Annex B; Credit and other special provisions), I  can't see how we are exposed to credit risk; we will not sign the XONON  Implementation Agreement with GE until we have received the $9.9 million  payment from CCSI.  If CCSI does not agree to return the spark spread  confirmation upon our request, as defined per the agreement, then CCSI is in  default of the agreement and the spark spread confirmation becomes worthless.  My main concern is with the general terms and conditions of the spark spread  confirmation because I know there are some errors in there that need to be  corrected:  There are three prices for the Gas Daily index referenced - low, high and  mid.  We need to define which curve we want to reference. We need to change the name from Catalytica to Catalytica Combustion Systems,  Inc. I think ECT should now be changed to Enron North America in the agreement,  but please advise on this I need to provide the details for CCSI (e.g., name, title, payment account  information)  Also, if Lucy can review the document for any other errors that would be a  good idea.  I was looking to get these items corrected in anticipation of sending to CCSI  sometime around the end of next week.  Please feel to contact me with any other questions.

2022-04-05 04:25:23+00:00,true,4,"  Attached is an executive summary of Watson Farley & William's (WFW) opinion  prepared by their partner, Neale Gregson.    Essentially, we have no case against Hyundai as Seller. We do have one cause  of action against the Owners : for failing to set out on the voyage in such  time that the vessel could reasonably be expected to arrive at loadport  within ETA.  Success of an action against the Owners depends very much on the question of  whether the Owners reasonably believed that the ETA they set was achievable  at the time they set it. If subsequent delays were in fact ""unforseen"", the  Owners would unlikely be held liable.   Russell has advised that, from his trading experience, delays in this case  may not be unforseen. His testimony in any action would be crucial.  I understand that the loss to ECTS is in the region of USD230,000.  WFW  estimates proceedings (which entails arbitration in London and potentially an  arrest and related proceedings in Malaysia) to be in the region of  USD100,000.  Further, as the action is fact dependant, success cannot be  predetermined with any degree of certainty.  I would advise that the commercial benefits of an action be carefully  considered before a decision to do so is made.

2022-04-05 03:45:10+00:00,true,4,"  Here is a short summary of PG&E's application.  I haven't gone through the  appendices which contain the agreements that would need to be executed as  part of a final bid proposal.  There are seven agreements in five volumes.   The following represents PG&E's proposal, unless otherwise designated.  PG&E filed its application and agreements relative to the sale of its  hydro-electric facilities.  This represents nearly 4,000 MW of generating  capacity at a net book value of $1.3 billion (as of 12/31/98).  This proposal  excludes the 1,000 MW of generating capacity owned by public agencies under  contract to PG&E.  PG&E will submit testimony and a proponent's environmental  assessment (PEA) within 30 days.  The auction will be held in two-stages.  The first stage is a Request for  Qualifications.  The second will be a binding bid process.  PG&E hopes to  complete selection of a winning bidder within 21 weeks, after Commission  approval of its plan.  After valuation, the assets will no longer be subject  to Commission jurisdiction, regulation.  The sale is contingent upon CPUC  approval of contract terms acceptable to PG&E and approval by FERC of the  license transfer.  PG&E also proposes that the RMR contracts be transferred  with the generation assets.  (I would assume ISO/FERC need to approve that as  well.)  PG&E has also retained exclusive right to reject any bid or all bids  and to terminate the sale of any facility, at its sole discretion.  PG&E proposes to auction its assets by watershed (of which there are five  watershed areas) or in bundles within a watershed (of which there are 20).   This makes 25 possible bid packages.  PG&E also states that it is receptive  to other packages, including run-of-river.  The winner will be selected based  on price alone.  PG&E Gen will be able to bid under the same terms and  conditions as others with the following exceptions:  1.  PG&E Gen's bid will reflect the benefit to consumers of avoided capital  gains tax.  PG&E's application states that PG&E Gen will then have an  offsetting increase in income tax as a result of a reduced tax basis.  It is  not explicit as to how those offsetting affects will be reflected.  This  treatment would be commensurate with the tax advantage provided to municipal  bidders, who have the benefit of tax-exempt financing.  2.  PG&E Gen would be exempt from entering into a 2-year O&M agreement with  PG&E, as the sale to the affiliate will be essentially a spin-off.  PG&E Gen  would give preferential treatment to existing PG&E employees.  (We are  looking into the statute language to see if this is a correct interpretation.)  PG&E is also maintaining certain T&D facilities for reliability purposes.   PG&E will also require an ""islanding agreement"" where certain generators will  provide energy to PG&E during transmission outages.  PG&E states that ""to the  extent the islanding agreement conflicts with the mandatory buy-sell  requirement in the preferred policy decision, PG&E requests the Commission to  waive that requirement.""  (This raises an interesting question:  outside of  those islanding agreement, does PG&E envision the mandatory buy/sell  requirement would transfer to the new owners of generation?)  Some of the issues/questions that are not explicit are:  1.  The timing of the credit against CTCs.  I'm assuming it occurs only upon  close of sale and after requisite regulatory approvals.  This means interim  valuation will still be important.  2.  The interaction, if any, between a Proponents Environmental Assessment  and California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review?  3.  The consolidation of PG&E's proposal into the Commission's valuation  proceeding.  4.  The issues relative to market power, environmental, etc. is not  addressed.  While the auction might indicate a natural mitigation of market  power if the assets are sold in bundles, if the bid for the system is larger  than the accumulation of individual bids, this would allow for a total system  sale.  A quote in CEM from Steve Peace said that if the Commission tries to  incorporate other issues into the sale, the hydro issue will probably just  end up back in Sacramento.  Any questions or comments on PG&E's proposal, feel free to contact me.","Here is a brief summary of PG&E's application, which contains the agreements that would need to be executed as part of a final bid.

The transaction must be governed by a market standard master agreement or  occur on a French regulated market  2.

There are 12 categories of article 25 firms (including Bank of France,  insurance companies, broker types, etc.)  .For example, one murky designation  includes ""persons who supply an investment service which is ancillary to  their professional activity, provided the rules governing such activity do  not prohibt the carrying on of investment services"".

2022-04-05 07:56:35+00:00,true,4,"  Sara,  Attached is the last draft in our directory; believe this is the most recent  copy    Regarding the OMNIBUS agreement, I found a copy from Brad and I believe it is  a standard document.  However, it appears as if we were originally planning  to add some language to cover credit issues.  As the deal is now structured, CCSI pays us the entire amount of 9.9 MMUSD up  front, instead of in tranches.  If the spark spread swaption were to somehow  become effective, CCSI would never have to pay Enron additional funds under  any scenario, we only can pay out to them if they elect to exercise at the  end of any given month during the 2003-2013 period in which the swaption  could become effective.  If the swaption is out of the money, CCSI will never  exercise for that month.  Therefore, the only possible exposure on the credit  side that I can now think of is the initial period between the actual signing  of the deal and the actual transfer of the funds.

2022-04-05 04:18:41+00:00,true,4,"  From discussions with PACAF, USARAK and the NAVFAC Contracting Officers, we  are aware of the following procurements that are intended to be released as a  multi-base effort with a single solicitation.  This supersedes my last  transmission on this subject, because the Navy has just released a new RFI  for a grouped series of bases in California.   1.  Navy, Southwest.     a.  Pt Huneme/Pt Mugu were intended as the first procurement on a bundled  basis, but they are on hold awaiting funding for Phase 2.  They need to do  life cycle cost analysis,  system condition assessment, and inventory.  A  draft RFP will be issued to industry for comment.  The final RFP,  optimistically (according to the NAVFAC SWDiv Commander) could be out as  early as this quarter.  Doug Powell, the Contracting Officer, says a more  realistic date is April-May of 2000.  However, Ralph Torres, the NAVFAC  Business Line Manager for this procurement, is attending a PACFLT meeting  this month in Hawaii to try to hurry this up.    b.  A new RFI has just hit the street, due 15 Nov 99, for electrical, gas,  water, and wastewater privatization at 5 USN locations in Southern  California.  These are Naval Warfare Assessment Station, Corona, CA; Naval  Air Station, Fallon, NV; Naval Air Station, Lemoore, CA; Naval Weapons  Station, Seal Beach, CA (Main Station); and Naval Weapons Station, Seal  Beach, CA (Detachment Fallbrook).       2.  Marines,Southwest.      a.  NAVFAC intends to combine 29 Palms, MCLB Barstow, MCAS Yuma and MCRD  San Diego into one procurement.  We have responded to the RFI, as we have in  the case of the Navy, 1.a, above.  NAVFAC has has funding for Phase 2 for  Barstow and 29 Palms, but not for the other two yet.  The RFP is expected to  hit the street in the April-May, 2000 time frame.    b.  NAVFAC intends to combine Camp Pendleton, a large base in CA, with a  small base used for mountain warfare training at Bridgeport, CA.  The  combination is being made for funding lines and chain of command reasons.   The real plum here is the very large Marine base at Pendleton.  The RFP  is  currently scheduled for release April, 2000, but we think it will be a few  months later to have the above 4-base procurement hit the street first.   3.  Navy, Northwest.  NAVFAC intends to release virtually all their  Northwest activities in a single solicitation.  This includes the following  locations:    -Naval Subase bangor   -Camp Wesley Harris   -Olalla Housing   -Port Hadlock   -Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Keyport   -Naval Station Bremerton   -Naval Hospital Bremerton   -Jackson Park Naval Houising   -Naval Fuel Depot Manchester   -Naval Station Everett   -Naval Radio Station Jim Creek   -MWR Pacific Beach   -Naval Air Station Whidbey Island    EFSI was invited to present at their Industry forum in Seattle where this  procurement was announced on 4 Aug 99.

So here is a definitive explanation of quasi-rent.  You can also look in Besanko on pages 153-154.  Note that this definition does not change how we should solve the problems.  It is simply a definition.  I apologize for any sudden panic attacks this causes.  Quasi-rent should be considered as equal to your sunk costs.  This is the amount another business can hold you up for after your entry.  If I have to sink 5 million dollars to enter, my quasi-rent will be 5 million dollars, which I may be held up for after I enter.   Thus in solving holdup problems, you can consider it two ways.  1.  The potential holdup amount is equal to the quasirent which equals the sunk cost at that point. or 2. How much does a firm have to receive to continue to produce AFTER sinking their sunk costs.  I hope this definition has cleared the haze which I am at least partially responsible.   Once again, the explanation of how to solve these problems has always been correct.

Stuart (who was also  speaking for John Nowlan) wants to arrest the vessel as it arrives in  Kuantan, West Malaysia to discharge the PX which was to be supplied to ECTS.  According to Russell's calculations below, the vessel is due to arrive in  Kuantan on or about 11 -12 October.  The objective is to arrest the vessel while it still has the cargo for the  highest nuisance value.  Since we may be at the brink of commencing action, below is a quick status  update (also for the easy reference of Richard who reads this in copy):  Cause of Action and Damages As advised by WFW,  ECTS only has one cause of action against the vessel  owners ie., failing in their duty to reasonably despatch the vessel to arrive  within ETA.    The cause of action is highly dependant on fact. Although we have some  evidence that suggest that the initial ETA Daesan of 11/12 under the  charterparty may not have been realistic, we still do not have all the facts  as to why the vessel was delayed in the preceding port in Yantai, China. We  were told by the vessel owners that the delay was due to the preceding  charterers not having the necessary import licence ready, which if true,  works in favour of the charterers.  As advised by WFW, the quantum of damages recoverable remains an issue. ECTS  is likely to be able to recover  the difference in freight (about USD87,000),  but the difference in price of the PX (about USD141,000) is less certain as  the question of remoteness is again fact dependant. Suzanne advises that the  cases have not always been consistent.  Winning the case, therefore, is not a sure thing.  The above has been communicated to Russell as the matter developed, as well  as John and Stuart over the phone.    Arresting the vessel I took Suzanne Bainbridge's and Neale Gregson's advice over the phone earlier  this evening. I am also scheduled to meet with Neale on Monday (4 Oct) or  with both Neale and Suzanne on Tues (5 Oct), depending on Russell going  through his tapes. I anticipate the meeting to be more likely Monday than  Tuesday.  As advised, it is possible to arrest the vessel in Kuantan before the formal  commencement of arbitration proceedings.   For an arrest in Kuantan, arrest papers will have to be prepared by Malaysian  lawyers. There is no need to quantify the claim for the arrest papers under  Singapore and English law., but can only assume that the same is true under  Malaysian law (which for most part follow English law). The arrest papers  have to be endorsed by a Kuantan judge.  Under English and Singapore law (and presumably Malaysian law), the cargo  owners would have a prima facie case against the arresting party for  interfering with the sale and purchase contract. However, as ECTS has a prima  facie case for arrest. The arrest would therefore not be wrongful and ECTS  would not likely be liable to the cargo owners in that respect.  The cost for arrest proceedings alone in Singapore are typically around  SGD8,000 and is likely to be the same in Malaysia.  However, Kuantan is apparently a notoriously difficult place to arrest a  vessel because the judge is not usually accomodating and not well versed in  admiralty law.   It was initially thought by Russell and Stuart that the vessel would be in  Kuantan over the weekend. Russell has since confirmed that that is not the  case. This is fortunate because Neale advises that there would have been  almost no chance of getting an order from the Kuantan judge over the weekend.  Regards  Matt    ","Alan I spoke with Stuart Bland a short while ago and instructs that ECTS would like to commence an action against the vessel owners.

We received a  favorable PD, that should be voted out today, that denied SDG&E's request but  allowed them to make a more complete showing in their Rate Design Window  (RDW) Filing, yet another regulatory proceeding.  They have done so.  There were specific, strategic reasons why we protested SDG&E's VBU proposal  in the Post-Transition Proceeding:  1.  Specific rate design proposals that were not relevant to ending the rate  freeze were not within the scope of the post-transition filing, which is  where SDG&E made its proposal. 2.  SDG&E didn't provide a very thorough analysis for the cost reasons to  change the rate design.  The PD stated that the Commission was concerned  about rate design for ""prized customers"". 3.  We were concerned about the precedential affect such a rate design  proposal would have relative to the other utilities. 4.  At that time, we were still interested in offering facilities-based  services, like VBUs.  Distribution competition and interconnection issues associated with building  substations are within the scope of the OII on Distributed generation and  distribution competition proceeding, which seems to be the appropriate forum  for addressing the overall issue of the utilities' ability to thwart  facilities competition through anti-bypass rate design.  Despite the fact  that the overall policy will be determined in the DG proceeding, it seems  that the Commission is perfectly willing to address specific proposals in the  utility-specific proceedings (ie. PG&E GRC 2, SDG&E's RDW).  Now that it appears as though our business interest on facility-based  competition has waned, is there any interest in addressing the VBU issue in  SDG&E's RDW Proceeding?

They do have the advantage of  being in my directory and therefore available to send to you today.  I don't  think the final changes will be significant but if you want to use these as  starting points, please let me know so I can be sure you have the latest  material.  The PA is the Password Application which is the only document the prospective  counterparty actually signs by putting pen to paper.  The first time the  counterparty logs on to the system with its approved password, it is required  to agree to the ETA (Electronic Trading Agreement) by clicking on an ""I  Agree"" box after scrolling through the agreement.  The GTC's are the  contractual terms that apply to online transactions if there is no master  agreement in place.  Legal will have the ability to restrict a counterparty  to trading only certain products online if we feel it is necessary.  While  most financial transactions will be governed by GTC's that look like our  ""Omnibus"" documentation, the weather derivatives look more like a ""Deemed  ISDA.""  One final complication, the credit group has asked us to create two  sets of documents: one for highly creditworthy counterparties which will have  no credit provisions included and a second set for counterparties credit is  not quite comfortable with which will contain a provision allowing us to call  for collateral if we choose.

I would appreciate it if you will call me at  9.15am SGP  8 Oct (still your 7 Oct) to discuss the matter and to let me have your  instructions.  I have faxed to you Rajah & Tann's advice received tonite. I have also just  spoken with Toh Kian Seng, the lawyer who has been advising. He works with  Steven Chong and has written a book on admiralty practice. His advice in a  nutshell :  1. According to Lloyd's Maritime Information Services, the vessel is bareboat  chartered to MTM Ship Management (""MTM"") for 3 years from June 1999. MTM is a  Singapore incorporated company.   2. On the face, our action should be against MTM in personam. However, since  MTM is not the beneficial owner of the vessel, she cannot be arrested in  Singapore (Singapore law does not allow it).  3. Malaysian law apparently allows for the arrest. But as previously advised  and discussed, arresting in Malaysia (especially in Kuantan) is procedurally  difficult. Russell estimates that the vessel is due to arrive in Kuantan over  the weekend. I am not certain about the shipwatch facilities in Kuantan and  their reliability.  Malaysian lawyers would have to be engaged.  4. A remote possibility exists that MTM may have sub-time chartered the  vessel to another party. In which case, the proper party to an action would  be such sub-time charterer and an arrest would not be possible. Rajah & Tann  advises that the broker should be able, in the ordinary course, to give us  that information. I will ask Russell to find out in the morning. However, I  am not encouraged by the fact that the broker was not able to even tell us  that the vessel was bareboat chartered to MTM.  5. If we proceeded to arrest the vessel and there is a sub-time charter, the  arrest will be set aside. We are not likely to have any other liability, but  that is a matter of Malaysian law.  6. MTM is not a small player. They manage about 8-10 vessels but we do not  know presently whether they own any.  They may have other substantial assets.  I will conduct a company search on MTM.  7. If we decide not to arrest in Malaysia, an action can be brought against  MTM in personam. A letter of demand can be sent to them first. If they are  not the proper party, they would be in a position to tell us and is likely to  do so (if not for anything else, to save legal costs).  I will also try to ascertain the legal costs and disbursements incurred  todate. With the urgent attention we have required of WFW and Rajah & Tann, I  imagine it would not be insubstantial.

ENA, formerly ECT,  purchased the NDF's and then did a back to  back NDF with Enron International for the identical risk.  The gain or loss  associated with the NDF thus was reflected on EI's books.    Now that EI is no longer an operating entity, I understand that the same  transactions are still being handled on a back to back basis with EI from  ENA..  Do you foresee that this will be a long range approach to these sorts  of transactions or will each of the regions have to execute an ISDA agreement  with ENA in order to get the gain or loss on the appropriate regions's books?   From a tax perspective, the income is all US source income and therefore  leaving the income on EI's books while apportioning the gainor loss to the  various regions for financial reporting purposes if fine.

Thida contributed this article on unemployment from the Economist, 2-Oct= -99  The economy: Work ethic   ON THEIR way to winning the general election in 1979, the Conservatives put up posters claiming that =0F""Labour isn=0F't working=0F"".=  Next time, Gordon Brown told the Labour Party conference this week, the message =0F""Labour is working=0F"" should be splashed across the nation=0F's billboa= rds. Since Labour returned to office in May 1997, the number of people in work has risen to 27.4m, a record high, and unemployment has tumbled. No wonder that the chancellor had the confidence to proclaim that =0F""Britain can deliver,=  in our generation, employment opportunity for all... full employment for our country.=0F"" Were the unemployment figures your guide, you might think that Britons were already fully employed. The proportion of the workforce claiming the dole, 4.2%, is the lowest since February 1980. The proportion who are =0F"" ILO unemployed=0F""=0F-the definition used by the International Labour Organisat= ion in Geneva which, in essence, means those looking for work=0F-is 5.9%, the lowe= st since records began in 1984.  There is, however, more to the labour market than the unemployment rate. Th= e government=0F's Labour Force Survey divides the population into three: the employed, the ILO unemployed, and the =0F""economically inactive=0F""=0F-ie, = those who are neither in work nor looking for it. Statistics for all three groups taken together paint a less pretty picture than do the unemployment data alone.  Start with employment. Although the number in work is higher than ever, the proportion is lower than at its peak in 1990. Then, 75.2% of people of working age (men aged 16 to 64, women aged 16 to 59) were employed. Now, 74= % are. With the employment and unemployment rates both down, it follows that inactivity is higher=0F-by 2% of the working-age population=0F-than in 1990= .  In part, this is because youngsters are spending longer in education. Their absence from the labour market is temporary, and they should join it better equipped. However, inactivity has also increased among workers (actually, men) over 25.  As the shows, the unemployed comprise a smaller share of the population tha= n in 1990. Women are more likely to be in work and less likely to be inactive than they were. But men have become less likely to work and more likely to be outside the labour market altogether. Much of this is a hangover from th= e recession of the early 1990s: since 1990, the male inactivity rate has rise= n by 4.4 percentage points: half of this rise had occurred by 1992, and more than two-thirds by 1994.  Many of the men who lost jobs in the early 1990s never returned. Plenty retired early. Many were pensioned off as long-term sick or disabled rather than continuing to seek work. Although the population as a whole was no les= s healthy, the number of long-term sick rose from about 300,000 in 1992 to more than 750,000 last year.  How much has this depleted the labour force? It is impossible to be exact, but suppose that the same proportion of men aged between 25 and 50 was economically active now as in 1990. Then labour supply would be higher, by around 330,000. Were the employment rate for these men the same as it was then, an extra 218,000 would be in work. For men aged 50-64, labour supply is short by 152,000 and employment by 64,000.  This trend is not peculiarly British. Most developed countries have seen me= n =0F's employment and activity rates fall and women=0F's rates rise. And Bri= tain has fewer inactive men, relative to its population, than most other OECD countries. Nonetheless, Britain still wastes too many workers.  The government=0F's main answer to long-term joblessness, the New Deal, has=  so far mainly been aimed at those aged under 25, and at those of that group wh= o say they are seeking work rather than the inactive. Ministers claim that this programme is achieving great things. In fact, it is too early to tell. Yes, long-term unemployment has fallen among the young since Labour took office. But then it has fallen for all age groups, and most of the decrease came during the party=0F's first year, before the New Deal was in operation= .  So far, however, less has been done for older workers. A programme to help them into work, New Deal 25-plus, has been running in pilot form since June= . A scheme is also being set up for over-50s. In his conference speech this week, Mr Brown promised to extend the New Deal to become a =0F""Permament De= al=0F"": a recognition, perhaps, that =0F""full employment=0F"" as the chancellor defi= nes it may be a long time coming.

2022-04-05 20:20:47+00:00,false,5,"  Claude Huss found this article on whether a government program to promote training is using marginal incentives   Should California Media Firms Get State Funds for Training?  By SHEILA MUTO >From The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition   For years, the state Employment Training Panel gave little attention to two renowned California enterprises -- multimedia and entertainment.  But then both industries started complaining of a tight labor market and stiff competition from outside the state. As a result, a raft of companies, including Seagram Co.'s Universal Studios, Walt Disney Co. and USWeb/CKS Corp., have been the beneficiaries of $9 million from the Employment Training Panel. The eight-member board metes out about $100 million annually to attract and retain businesses and jobs by improving workers' skills.  And while California clearly has an interest in promoting a healthy climate for business -- including an able work force -- some are questioning whether multimedia and entertainment are really the kind of struggling industries that couldn't make it without state assistance.  The funds doled out by the Training Panel amount to ""corporate welfare,"" says Naomi Lopez, a policy analyst at the Pacific Research Institute, a free-market-oriented think tank in San Francisco. And ""just because there's a labor shortage in entertainment and multimedia doesn't mean we need to be using government resources to alleviate {it}.""  According to Brady Bevis, director of San Francisco's Bay Area Multimedia Partnership, that's exactly what the Training Panel should be doing to ensure the health of the state's economy. ""These industries and jobs can go anywhere,"" she adds, noting they are already moving to Canada, India and  Japan.  Training Panel funds come from a special tax collected from businesses, which amount to a maximum of about $7 per employee. Businesses or training agencies apply to the panel to underwrite their training programs, and can be reimbursed for them after employees complete the training and stay with their jobs for 90 days. The bulk of panel funds -- between 60% and 70% -- go to manufacturers.  Kathleen Milnes, a senior vice president at the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. in Los Angeles, estimates that entertainment companies fork over about $4 million annually to the panel fund, but until recently hadn't benefited from it. ""We were subsidizing other industries,"" she says.  So in 1996 Ms. Milnes's and Ms. Bevis's organizations prompted the Training Panel's venture into the celluloid and digital realms. The two economic-development nonprofits devised a program called SkillsNet, which aims to keep cutting-edge, high-paying entertainment and multimedia jobs in the state. The effort has received about $653,000 from the panel to study which skills companies are looking for, set up a Web page, and help firms tap into state training funds, among other things. Later this month, SkillsNet plans to unveil a new report on the post-production industry, plus an online posting of internships.  But misgivings about the panel's new focus are being unveiled as well.  Though he hasn't looked at the impact of state training dollars spent on multimedia and entertainment companies, Richard W. Moore, a management professor at California State University-Northridge, says that panel funds are most effective when used as an incentive for employers who typically ""underinvest"" in training. In contrast, entertainment and multimedia companies ""tend to invest in training anyway,"" says Prof. Moore, who was commissioned by the panel to assess its effectiveness. He released reports in 1994 and 1995; his next study is set to come out later this summer.  In general, he says, the panel ""works."" Based on his 1995 report, Prof. Moore found that the training provided by panel funds meant that after two years, employees who received retraining increased their salary by $4,910, and new hires increased theirs by $6,038. Considering the panel spends only about $1,500 a participant, he says that's a healthy payoff.  Still, Sen. Patrick Johnston, the Stockton Democrat who wrote the legislation that created the Employment Training Panel in 1982, is attempting to reel in the agency through Senate Bill 43. Among other things, the bill, which has already passed the Senate, reduces the panel from a grant-making agency to an advisory commission to the state Employment Development Department.  While the panel has ""helped some workers and boosted some businesses that are important to the California economy,"" in other instances, it has made less than stellar funding decisions, Sen. Johnston says, pointing to funds given to hotels, law firms and other service industries that ""clearly weren't going anywhere."" But he believes that the agency's focus on multimedia and entertainment will prove to be ""an effective use of state funds.""  During the past three years, the panel has awarded $8.9 million for retraining about 5,000 workers and training 320 new hires on the latest computer systems, software, and techniques in the multimedia and entertainment fields. For example, state records show that Universal Studios was granted $1.1 million last year to retrain 1,423 employees in management and computer skills. And Video Symphony Entertraining Inc. in Los Angeles, received $1.4 million to retrain workers from companies including Walt Disney on techniques such as video editing and digital animation.  The entertainment and multimedia industries need the funds, says Charles Lundberg, the panel's marketing director, because ""competition keeps getting tougher and the software and hardware keeps getting upgraded.""  Indeed, Paul Sidlo, chief executive of REZN8 Productions Inc., which does everything from Web design to visual effects for film and television, says his Los Angeles firm has lost out to Canadian companies on a handful of contracts because they underbid him by nearly 40% -- thanks to government subsidies. Given that, the 3-D animation training that 15 of his employees received last year through funding from the state -- which he estimates was worth about $40,000 in instruction costs and employees' time -- went a long way toward reducing the $700,000 he spends annually on retraining workers.  The training subsidy, he says, ""really helped.""   My comments:  Trainin funds are most useful it they go to folks who would not pay for the training themselves; perhaps due to difficulties borrowing.  Also, if the skills are useful at many employers, no single employer wants to pay for the skills that workers walk away with to competitors.  Do you think the multimedia training subsidies meets these critera?  If not, how could one target the training better?   David I.

2022-04-05 16:34:31+00:00,true,5,"  This gives a little flavor of how we factor into the backbone capacity market.    Category:   Backbone, DWDM, Enron Communications   Description Building A Better Backbone - And Business Plan  :   Detail:    By Carol Wilson, Inter@ctive Week September 6, 1999 6:23 AM PT    The numbers are staggering: Six major new national fiber-optic networks will come on line during the next two years at a cost of $18 billion. Those new networks are in  addition to those already built and operated by the Big Three of long-distance: AT&T, MCI WorldCom and Sprint.  Thousands of miles of fiber-optic cable are being installed in ducts to which new fiber can be easily added by companies such as Enron Communications, Frontier  Communications, IXC Communications, Level 3 Communications, Qwest Communications International and Williams Communications.  And that's just a piece of the story.  While competition in the backbone network business is booming, new  technologies coming into the market will make it much easier to increase bandwidth available on any fiber-optic network tenfold or more. Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) systems now  exist to put data traffic onto 160 different wavelengths on a single fiber-optic cable.  Technology exists today to enable each of those wavelengths to transport 10 gigabits per second of data. Within two years, that will reach 40 gigabits per wavelength per second.  ""In effect, the backbone of the Internet is being rebuilt. The next step: Recover all those costs of construction,'' says analyst Peter Bernstein at Infonautics Consulting. ""And that step may be more difficult than building the networks themselves.''  The combination of major new network construction and new technology for  adding network capacity has led industry analysts and executives to predict a bandwidth glut that is likely to drive down prices in backbone transport of data much as the price of long-distance telephony has plummeted in the past few years. Frontier Communications admitted as much earlier this year when its second-quarter earnings weren't up to expectations.  Rather than a free fall in prices, however, expect the market to quickly find new ways to use bandwidth, both in terms of network-based applications and bigger backbone networks to support the rapidly growing field of faster access via Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and cable modems. The challenge for network operators is to create new business models that capitalize on something other than cheaper bandwidth.  ""I think the danger isn't so much of a glut as a lack of planning for the backbone network that could cause some major problems,"" says Claudia Bacco, an analyst at TeleChoice who studies the development of DSL. ""Once DSL starts selling as a volume service, it will very quickly increase the demand for bandwidth in the backbone. Service providers need to have  planned ahead.""  It's not surprising, then, to see a growing number of alliances between the  new backbone builders and the competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) that have been building  DSL networks in major markets across the U.S.  Qwest invested in both Covad Communications and Rhythms NetConnect-ions, for instance, and a third data CLEC, NorthPoint Communications, includes Enron, Frontier and  Level 3 among its strategic partners.  That doesn't mean, however, that all of the companies investing billions in burying fiber-optic cable stand to reap rich rewards, cautions Bernstein at Infonautics.  ""The problem isn't a glut of bandwidth, but a glut of service providers,"" he says. ""If everyone has the same business model and is going after the same customers, that's a  problem. In addition, there are timing issues . . . If you build it, they will come - but not necessarily when you need them to.""  At least nine players have built or are building national fiber-optic backbone networks. These look very similar, says Fred Harris, director of network planning and design at Sprint. ""There are generally three East-West routes and three or four North-South routes that everyone builds,"" he says. ""New York to San Francisco, Atlanta to Los Angeles, Seattle to Boston - everybody has fiber either in or near those corridors.""  In earlier network deployments, the fiber was buried, never to be exhumed. But today's fiber cables go into ducts, allowing fibers to be pulled out or slid in later. Capacity can be added without any backhoes.  Today's newer fiber-optic cable, from companies such as Corning and Lucent Technologies, is designed to support higher transmission speeds without the light dispersion problems that limited speeds or distances on other fiber-optic cables.  DWDM technology and optical amplifiers, which boost the power of a laser's signal over a given wavelength, enable bandwidth to be added and allow signals to travel farther without the need for as many repeaters to boost signals along the way. Eliminating repeaters in a long-distance network wrings out installation, maintenance and power costs.  As Harris points out, if every company building a national backbone has 30 fibers along each major route, and each fiber can carry 80 different wavelengths of light,  that's more than 20,000 different signals. Today, most of those signals would be powered by  Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) gear, which operates at 2.5 gigabits per second, but a growing number have moved up to gear that operates at 10 Gbps.  Both Lucent and Nortel Networks have announced equipment that supports 160 wavelengths on a single cable, and other vendors will have similar equipment within the next two years.  Also coming into the market by 2002 will be new SONET gear that quadruples the current transmission rates from 10 Gbps to 40 Gbps. MCI WorldCom is testing these systems, known as OC-768 transmission systems, and expects to have one commercially available by early 2001, says Rama Nune, senior manager of optical and data network technology development.  Nune stresses, however, that what's more important than having all the  bandwidth is knowing ""how to intelligently provision services over it and manage it.""  New Models  Not surprisingly, most of the newer network operators have quickly moved to talking about services, not bandwidth.  There are exceptions to this: Enron is building a network that transmits Internet Protocol (IP)-based traffic directly over a fiber-optic network, with no intervening transport systems or protocols. But its network is built to provide backbone bandwidth for Internet service providers and content providers, says Stan Hanks, vice president of research and technology at the company.  At Level 3, falling backbone service prices would be good news, says spokesman David Powers. ""We want to drive prices down by reducing the underlying cost of the network,"" he says. ""We think we can do it because we are building a green-field network that doesn't have the cost of legacy technology like circuit switches."" Most other network operators are looking to add services to their mix, including Web hosting, to create a differentiated service. MCI WorldCom through its UUnet subsidiary, Frontier, Qwest and others have announced Web hosting services.  Greater bandwidth and lower prices also will enable new video services to be delivered over the Internet, says Vab Goel, vice president of IP engineering and technology at Qwest.  ""One of the things Qwest is doing is building its own access rings in 25 major markets,"" Goel says. ""We think this network will drive cost down and increase performance for value-added applications which can be delivered over an IP network. Today, most video is compressed. With faster access speeds, you can watch TV shows over the Internet. This becomes interesting when you talk about having access to any TV show broadcast anywhere around the globe.""  In addition to enabling new services, however, the sudden availability of bandwidth will dramatically change the way services are priced and sold.  ""It's the next great challenge of the Internet - deciding how you are going to bill customers and what they will be willing to pay for,"" analyst Bernstein says. ""I'm not sure anyone knows yet.""  Part of that challenge is matching a service that customers value with the  need to recover the high costs of expanding a network.  ""George Gilder likes to say that bandwidth will be free - well, putting in 20,000 channels of OC-48 [2.5-Gbps transmision] isn't free; it costs billions,"" Sprint's Harris says. ""And the same thing goes when you build up the local copper network to do DSL or cable modems.""  Already, however, DSL prices are dropping to $30 to $40 per month for a  consumer service that offers up to 1.5 megabits per second. Businesses still typically pay $125 to $400 per month for higher-speed services that offer the same bandwidth in both upload and  download modes. That compares very favorably to the $2,000 per month most companies paid for a T1 line until the past two years.  But with customers assuming bandwidth will be cheap, how will nine backbone network providers recover their billions in investment?  ""I don't have a crystal ball,"" says Nune at MCI. ""With the access speeds going up - whether it be ADSL [Asymmetric DSL] or gigabit Ethernet - we anticipate many rich  applications to drive the bandwidth of our customers.""  Providing those applications - or at least building into the network the right hooks for new services - is the best hope for building a new revenue base, Harris agrees.  There will still be room for charging higher rates as well for levels of reliability and transmission speeds, says Qwest's Goel, but those charges will likely be packaged as part  of the application cost.  In a world where everyone has access to the same technology, it will be the business issues that ultimately decide who succeeds at building - and sustaining - the backbone of the next Internet.

E259-2; Leading Change and Leveraging Culture; Chatman Professor Jenny Chatman has taught both the day and evening core OB courses  consistently earning above a 6.0.  Jenny has taught this elective course in  the Executive Program numerous times and, again, gets consistently high  ratings.  This course will likely be focusing on leadership skills, cases,  and a fair amount of self-assessment in the leadership area.    E296-5; European Financial Markets; Portes Professor Richard Portes is visiting from London Business School.  He is an  expert in the European Monetary Union and will spend considerable time on  this topic.  The difference between this course and Professor Rich Lyons'  International Finance course is that this course will focus on Europe, will  be a bit more ""macro"", and study the institutional implications of the common  currency.  Rich Lyons' course will be focusing more on international  corporate finance relevant to multinational treasurers, CFO's, etc.    E234; Corporate Finance; Das Professor Das is visiting from Harvard this year and is currently teaching in  the day program.  I have heard he's a great teacher and, as you might  suspect, this course will be case-based.  E-296-3; Foundations of E-Business; Tachibana We have detailed course outlines in the office for Tachibana's course.  Ken  is a Haas MBA and has an MS in computer science and in engineer-economic  systems from Stanford University.  He is Vice President of Services of  RAINfinity, which is a startup focusing on scalability and reliability  solutions for e-commerce.

BA296-6; International Business and Japan; Lincoln This course offered on Mondays from 6:00 - 8:00 pm.  Course description now  on the web.  Remember, for evening students this course can only be taken for  one unit and counts as an academic one-unit course.

2022-04-05 18:00:16+00:00,true,5,"  SPRING FEES and FINANCIAL AID NEWS  Spring Fees CARS Billing Statements with assessed spring registration fees will be printed the weekend of  November 20 and  mailed before the Thanksgiving holiday.  You should receive it by  December 3, but are nonetheless responsible for paying fees by the deadline of December 15 even if you have not received a bill. Ensure that your local address is correct on Bearfacts. Fees can be read on Telebears if you do not receive a bill.  Health insurance fees are automatically waived in the spring semester if they were waived in the fall term.  However, the assessment for health insurance will show under New Charges.  Do not panic because the waived health insurance amount will show in the next section of the CARS bill.  You have the option of paying your bill in full or electing the Deferred Payment Plan (DPP), wherein your fees are paid in five equal monthly installments.  There is a $40 participation fee each semester for the DPP.  Students who entered in fall 1999, please be aware that your spring 2000 fees will appear $500 higher than fall semester as your deposit no longer offsets the total.  Financial Aid and Spring Fees If you are a financial aid recipient and there are no holds on your CARS account, you have enrolled for at least 6 units in spring semester and  returned all aid documents, then financial aid will credit your CARS account by the December 15 deadline.  If your aid is not sufficient to fully pay your registration fees, you must pay the remaining balance by Dec. 15 to avoid a late CARS charge or a $40 Deferred Payment Plan charge. If your financial aid amount exceeds your reg fees, then the remainder will be disbursed to you hopefully according to the following schedule:  Thursday, January 13 - if your Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) request has  been processed To sign up for EFT, download the form http://fbs.berkeley.edu/DISB/eftinfo.htm Tuesday, January 18 - checks will be mailed to local addresses for those students not signed up for EFT.  It may take up to 5- 7 business days to receive the check.  Be certain your mailing address is current with the University (database is different than Haas). You can update it on Bearfacts https://bearfacts.berkeley.edu  NOTE: Although Berkeley may credit your CARS account with aid in December, the official disbursement date for your federal student loan is not until mid-January 2000.  So interest does not begin to accrue on the second disbursement of your Unsubsidized Direct Loan until then.  Also, if your company is paying registration fees, you will not receive a refund of your student loan until the third week of January.  Individuals expecting their second disbursement of private loans checks can anticipate that the check will be available for pick-up or mailed to you (same arrangements as for your fall private loan disbursement) by the third week of January.

Should Nissan consider lowering the wages of some workers in order to layoff fewer workers?  I have attached a word 6.0 version of the article.  Also please note that section is in C135.

MTM is a Singapore incorporated company. On the face,  our action should be against MTM.  2. Because MTM is not the beneficial owner of the vessel, Singapore law does  not allow ECTS to arrest it for a claim against MTM. Although arrest in  Malaysia is possible, it is procedurally very difficult (especially over the  weekend in Kuantan).  3. There is a strong possibility that MTM has substantial assets sufficient  to meet ECTS's claim. MTM manages about 8 - 10 vessels but are not likely to  own any.  4. I have discussed the matter with Alan and Richard. Our proposed plan of  action is as follows:  (a)  ECTS will not arrest the vessel in Malaysia over the weekend. If  necessary, the vessel can still be arrested on its next cycle or at the next  port which allows for arrest.  (b) I have instructed our external Singapore lawyers (Rajah & Tann) to do a  full search on MTM and EPTS (the agents) to determine their assets. A search  with the Singapore Registry of Company will reveal paid up capital and annual  accounts which will give us an indication. Such a detailed search, however,  is likely to take 2 or 3 working days.  (c)  Once the searches are received and we have confirmed MTM (and less  likely EPTS) to have substantial assets, I will instruct our external English  lawyers (Watson Farley & Williams) to give a full opinion of the merits under  English law and subject to that, commence arbitration proceedings against MTM  and possibly EPTS as well.  5.

2022-04-05 22:20:37+00:00,true,5,"  Thida also contributed this article from the Economist 25-Sep-99  A new economy for the New World: Inflation may not be as dead as it seems  ONCE upon a time sailors went to sea in the belief that the earth was flat, putting them at risk of dropping off the edge. Fortunately the discovery that it was round solved that problem. Economic thinking about monetary policy and inflation has undergon= e a similar about-turn. In the 1960s, the conventional economic wisdom was that monetary policy could reduce unemployment. The theoretical underpinning for this was the Phillips curve, named after Bill Phillips, an economist from New Zealand based at the London School of Economics. Mr Phillips, also a trained engineer, constructed a machine to demonstrate the workings of the economy, using water to represent liquidity. In 1958 he published a study showing that between 1861 and 1957 some kind of trade-off between wage inflation an= d unemployment seemed to have been operating in Britain: when unemployment wa= s high, inflation was low, and vice versa. This seemed to suggest that centra= l banks could permanently reduce unemployment by tolerating a bit more inflation.  A decade later, however, two American economists, Milton Friedman and Edmun= d Phelps, challenged this theory. The trade-off between inflation and unemployment, they argued, was only short-term, because once people came to expect higher inflation, they would demand higher wages, and unemployment would rise back to its =0F""natural rate=0F"", which depended on the efficien= cy of the labour market. There was no long-term trade-off between inflation and unemployment: in the long run, monetary policy could influence only inflation. If policymakers tried to hold unemployment below its natural rat= e (also known by an acronym, NAIRU , the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment), inflation would be pushed ever higher.  Just as Messrs Friedman and Phelps had predicted, the level of inflation associated with a given level of unemployment rose through the 1970s, and policymakers had to abandon the Phillips curve. Today there is a broad consensus that monetary policy should focus on holding down inflation. But this does not mean, as is often claimed, that central banks are =0F""inflati= on nutters=0F"", cruelly indifferent towards unemployment.  If there is no long-term trade-off, low inflation does not permanently chok= e growth. Moreover, by keeping inflation low and stable, a central bank, in effect, stabilises output and jobs. Don Brash, governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, explains how this happens, using 4. The straight line represents the growth in output that the economy can sustain over the long run; the wavy line represents actual output. When the economy is producing below potential (ie, unemployment is above the NAIRU ), at point A , inflation will fall until the =0F""output gap=0F"" is eliminated. When output=  is above potential, at point B , inflation will rise for as long as demand is above capacity. If inflation is falling (point A ), then a central bank wil= l cut interest rates, helping to boost growth in output and jobs; when inflation is rising (point B ), it will raise interest rates, dampening dow= n growth. Thus if monetary policy focuses on keeping inflation low and stable= , it will automatically help to stabilise employment and growth.  The Fed clearly understands this relationship between inflation and the output gap, but initial signs suggest that the ECB may underestimate the extent to which it can safely hold interest rates low in the short run to boost output and jobs. It has repeatedly said that lower interest rates cannot reduce unemployment. That is undoubtedly true in the long run, but i= f an economy is operating below potential and the jobless rate is above the NAIRU , then interest rates can safely be cut, and hence output boosted, without pushing up inflation. Statements by ECB officials often appear to suggest that all of the 10% unemployment rate in the euro area is structura= l and none of it cyclical. However, estimates from the IMF suggest that outpu= t in the area is currently almost 2% below potential, ie, the economy is operating at point A . With growth in the euro area starting to pick up, th= e ECB is already muttering about a rise in interest rates. But it is far too soon: the area still has a significant output gap that will continue to hol= d down inflation.  Is a bit of inflation good for you   When inflation was in double digits, central banks had a simple rule: bring it down. But now that the rate in almost all rich economies is 2% or less, they are being forced to ask: how low? This is hotly debated, because some economists believe that inflation has economic benefits as well as costs.  Consider, first, the costs. When inflation is high, people find it difficul= t to distinguish between changes in average prices and changes in relative prices. For example, a firm cannot tell if a rise in the price of copper reflects general inflation or a scarcity of the metal. This distorts important price signals, leading to a misallocation of resources. Inflation also creates uncertainty about the future, which reduces investment. And lastly, because of the way inflation interacts with tax systems, which are never fully indexed for inflation, it reduces the real return on saving and hence reduces future growth.  Inflation in double digits clearly does considerable harm, but what about lower rates? And does 5% inflation do more damage than 2%, or zero? Yes, answers Martin Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research*. He believes that even modest inflation can do significant damage through its effect on saving. Tax is levied on nominal interest income, so as inflation rises, the real after-tax return on savings comes down and people save less, which depresses future growth rates. Mr Feldstein estimates that in America a cut in inflation from 2% to zero would permanently increase the level of GDP by 1%. To reduce inflation by two percentage points would involve a one-off loss in output of 5% of GDP , but the discounted present value of the future annual gains, of around 35% of GDP , would far outweigh the loss. Zero inflation, he concludes, is a worth= y goal.  Yet there is little empirical evidence that lower inflation rates do noticeably improve growth performance once inflation is below 5%, say. A scatter plot of inflation against growth for a range of countries shows no clear trend (see 5). A study by Robert Barro, an economist at Harvard University, found that a reduction in inflation of one percentage point increases the annual growth rate by a paltry 0.02 of a percentage point.  Some economists go much further, arguing that modest inflation, of perhaps 3-4%, is good for growth and employment. Nominal wages, they say, tend to b= e rigid downwards. Workers may be prepared to put up with flat wages when the inflation rate is 3%, which amounts to a decline in real income, but they are reluctant to accept a pay cut in money terms. So if the inflation rate is zero, real wages cannot be adjusted downwards in declining industries or regions, which means that unemployment will rise. Inflation, the argument runs, greases the wheels of the labour market, allowing real wages to adjus= t more smoothly.  A widely cited study by the Brookings Institution=0F+, which examined pay i= n America since 1959, confirmed that very few people take nominal wage cuts i= n any year. However, the problem of wage =0F""stickiness=0F"" may be overstated= . There have been few periods in the past when inflation has been less than 3% for an extended period, so it is not surprising that falling wages are rare. If inflation were to remain low, resistance to wage cuts might fade. Indeed, i= n Japan wages have been falling over the past two years. And as long as productivity is rising, allowing unit labour costs to fall, there may be no need for nominal pay cuts anyway. America=0F's recent experience certainly suggests that nominal wage rigidities are no cause for concern: unemploymen= t has continued to fall even though average inflation over the past three years has been only 2%.  A second common worry about zero inflation is that interest rates cannot fall below zero, so there is no way of allowing real interest rates to become negative to help the economy out of a recession. But the need for negative real interest rates may be exaggerated. Mervyn King, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, argues that negative real interest rates have been rare in America during the past half-century=0F?. During most recessions, low real interest rates have been enough to boost demand. The only time when there might be a problem is if the economy suffers a shock when the output gap is already large and inflation below target because policymakers have failed to react to a previous slump in demand. A pre-emptive policy which aims to prevent inflation going below target as well as above, argues Mr King, minimises the need for negative real interes= t rates.  The final and most serious concern is that if central banks aim for zero inflation, prices are more likely to fall for brief periods, and the experiences of the 1930s and Japan today show that deflation can be more dangerous than modest inflation. But falling prices are not necessarily a problem. Before the first world war, a decline in the average price level was quite common during periods of rapid technological change, such as the late 19th century; yet these were also periods of strong growth. This is quite different from the harmful sort of deflation seen during the Great Depression. Moreover, the odd year of falling prices does not matter so lon= g as it does not feed expectations that they will continue to fall, causing households to delay spending.  On balance, the benefits of retaining some inflation are probably overstated. Price stability reduces uncertainty and so offers the best economic environment for firms and households. So why do central banks not invariably aim for zero inflation? The answer is that official consumer-price indices tend to overstate the true rate of inflation in all countries, because they do not adjust fully for improvements over time in the quality of goods and services. Estimates suggest that in most countries the official consumer-price index overstates inflation by around 0.5-2.0% a year. This is the best reason why central banks should aim for a slightly positive inflation rate.  Flat-earth economics   With rates of consumer-price inflation of 2% or under, most rich countries have therefore more or less achieved =0F""price stability=0F"". However, that=  does not mean that central bankers can go out on the town and celebrate. Despite subdued inflation, the big three central banks all face their own particula= r dilemmas. Japan=0F's economy is still at risk from deflation. The ECB is ha= ving to deal with the added uncertainty of a completely new currency, which has made the bank=0F's monetary policy extra cautious at a time when output in = the euro area is stuck below its potential. As for the American economy, the Fe= d is baffled because inflation is currently lower than any economic model would have predicted.  Under the old economic rules, if unemployment fell below the NAIRU (thought to be around 5.5%), inflation would start to rise. This, in turn, implied that the maximum rate of growth the American economy could safely sustain (adding up growth in the labour force and in productivity) was about 2.25-2.5%. Today America=0F's jobless rate stands at a 30-year low of 4.2% = and GDP has grown at an average rate of almost 4% a year over the past three years. According to the textbooks, inflation should be rising. Instead, America=0F's underlying inflation rate has remained subdued. Hence all the = talk about the Goldilocks economy=0F-neither too hot nor too cold.  One popular explanation of why strong growth has not pushed up inflation is that the American economy is undergoing a paradigm shift. In this =0F""new economy=0F"", it is argued, information technology and increased global competition have opened up new investment opportunities and boosted productivity growth. Mr Greenspan himself frequently sings the praises of the IT revolution, and talks of a =0F""once-a-century phenomenon=0F"". Other economists go further and argue that in this new era of low inflation the Fed can throw away its rulebook: the notions of a NAIRU and a maximum sustainable rate of growth have become redundant. Inflation is dead.  Then again, perhaps not. America=0F's productivity growth in the non-farm sector has indeed increased, to an annual average of 2% over the past three years, twice the average over the previous 25 years. The big question is whether this is just a cyclical blip or a permanent increase in trend growth. If (a big if) this increase is maintained, it may raise the economy= =0F' s non-inflationary speed limit to 3% a year, say. But that does not mean there are no limits to growth: if it continues at its recent pace and the labour market continues to tighten, inflation is bound to rise.  Some people may want to believe in economic miracles, but there is an alternative explanation for America=0F's low rate of inflation. The country=  has benefited from four favourable factors. First, weak oil and commodity price= s until earlier this year, and a strong dollar and weak overseas demand, especially in Asia, have held down import prices. Second, an investment boo= m has created excess capacity which has made it hard for firms to pass on wag= e increases in higher prices. Although unemployment is at a 30-year low, America=0F's capacity utilisation is well below its historical average. Thi= rd, non-wage labour costs have been curbed by a booming stockmarket, which has allowed firms to reduce their contributions to employee pension plans. And fourth, the inflation rate has been nudged down by changes in the way of measuring it.  By holding down prices, these factors have in turn helped to restrain wages= . But the old relationship between a tight labour market and wage growth remains alive and well: real wage growth has accelerated over the past few years, as you would expect when the unemployment rate is below the NAIRU . This may have been temporarily offset by the favourable factors, but as these effects wear off, inflation is likely to creep up again. Oil prices are already rising; the dollar has slipped; and recovery in the rest of the world will push up import prices. There are also signs that nominal wage costs are now starting to pick up. Goldilocks is in danger of burning her tongue, and the Fed may come to regret that it did not raise interest rates sooner. Despite the increases this summer, real interest rates still remain lower than a year ago.  Reports of the death of inflation are therefore much exaggerated. Far from being dead, inflation may have taken on a new, more dangerous guise.  *=0F""The Costs and Benefits of Going from Low Inflation to Price Stability= =0F"", by Martin Feldstein.

For this week, please be sure you have read a story on determinants or  costs of long-term or very high inflation and/or on very high or long-term unemployment.  Later in the course we will examine changes in unemployment and inflation (and their relation) in the short run; this week we focus on definitions and long-run determinants and costs.  (Hint: for unemployment,  what has happened to the workweek in France?)  2. Concerning growth, you might want to look at:  Report: Corruption Ruining Economies Of South Asia         http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/19991101/wl/asia_un_1.html (a Reuters story)  3. Concerning measurement of ""The New Economy,"" a fellow student recommends  the Economist article at http://www.economist.com/editorial/freeforall/current/index_fn8276.html will all the pretty pics and graphs, or the plain text version below.   E-xaggeration: The digital economy is much smaller than you think  NEWSPAPERS and magazines are packed with stories about the digital economy, the information-technology (IT) revolution and the Internet age. That their pages are filled with advertising from IT firms presumably has nothing to do with it. Such firms account for a quarter of the total value of the S&P 500, and this week Dow Jones announced that Microsoft, Intel and SBC Communications will be included in its industrial average from November 1st. Not before time, many say, for high-technology businesses now account for a huge chunk of the economy. Actually, they don't. New figures published on October 28th by America's Department of Commerce appear to support the view that IT is very important to the American economy. The department now counts all business spending on software as investment (previously, it was a cost). This has both increased the apparent size of IT investment and boosted America's rate of growth in recent years. But measuring the size of the ""new"" economy is a statistical minefield. The most generous estimate comes from the OECD, which tracks the ""knowledge-based economy"". It estimates that this accounts for 51% of total business output in the developed economies-up from 45% in 1985. But this definition, which tries to capture all industries that are relatively intensive in their inputs of technology and human capital, is implausibly wide. As well as computers and telecoms, it also includes cars, chemicals, health, education, and so forth. It would be a stretch to call many of these businesses ""new"". A study published in June by the Department of Commerce estimates that the digital economy-the hardware and software of the computer and telecoms industries-amounts to 8% of America's GDP this year. If that sounds rather disappointing, then a second finding-that IT has accounted for 35% of total real GDP growth since 1994-should keep e-fanatics happy. Perhaps unwisely. A new analysis by Richard Sherlund and Ed McKelvey of Goldman Sachs argues that even this definition of ""technology"" is too wide. They argue that since such things as basic telecoms services, television, radio and consumer electronics have been around for ages, they should be excluded. As a result, they estimate the computing and communications-technology sector at a more modest 5% of GDP-up from 2.8% in 1990. This would make it bigger than the car industry, but smaller than health care or finance. In most other economies, the share is lower; for the world as a whole, therefore, the technology sector might be only 3-4% of GDP. But what, you might ask, about the Internet? Goldman Sachs's estimate includes Internet service providers, such as America Online, and the technology and software used by online retailers, such as Amazon.com. It does not, however, include transactions over the Internet. Should it? E-business is tiny at present, but Forrester Research, an Internet consultancy, estimates that this will increase to more than $1.5 trillion in America by 2003. Internet bulls calculate that this would be equivalent to about 13% of GDP. Yet it is misleading to take the total value of such goods and services, whose production owes nothing to the Internet. The value added of Internet sales-ie, its contribution to GDP-would be much less, probably little more than 1% of GDP. This is not to deny that the Internet is changing the way that many firms do business-by, for example, enabling them to slim inventories-but, in the near future, as a proportion of GDP, it is likely to remain small. A Luddite's lament  If measuring the size of the technology sector is hard, calculating its contribution to real economic growth is trickier still, because the prices of IT goods and services (adjusted for quality) have fallen sharply relative to the prices of other goods and services. For example, official figures show that America's spending on IT has risen by 14% a year in nominal terms since 1992, but by more than 40% a year in real terms. This figure is so high partly because it is extremely sensitive to assumptions about the rate at which the price and quality of IT is changing. The Commerce Department calculates that the technology sector has contributed 35% to overall economic growth over the past four years. But because such figures are based on spending in real terms, the Goldman Sachs study reckons they are misleading. In nominal terms, IT has accounted for a more modest 10% of GDP growth in the past four years. Another popularly quoted figure is that business spending on IT has risen from 10% of firms' total capital-equipment investment in 1980 to 60% today. But again, this is based on constant-dollar figures, and so it hugely exaggerates the true increase. In terms of current dollars (and before the latest revisions), Goldman Sachs calcuate that business investment in computers accounts for 35% of total capital spending, not 60%. And even this exaggerates the importance of IT, because much of the money goes to replace equipment which becomes obsolete ever more quickly. The share of IT in additional ""net"" investment is much smaller. Computers still account for only 2% of America's total net capital stock. For years economists have been seeking in vain for evidence that computers have dramatically raised productivity. One explanation for the failure of productivity to surge may be that official statistics are understating its growth. Another is that much investment in IT has been wasted: hours spent checking e-mail, surfing the Net or playing games reduce, not increase, productivity. A third may simply be that IT is still too small to make a difference: for the moment, appropriately enough, you can count the digital economy on the fingers of one hand. That is changing, and firms are learning. And note this: if you add in all computer software and telecoms (on the widest definition), the share of IT in the capital stock rises to 10-12%. As it happens, this is almost the same as railways at the peak of America's railway age in the late 19th century. Railways boosted productivity and changed the face of Victorian commerce. Hype is hype-but the new economy may yet happen anyway.

The main idea is that there  is no standard recipe.  What I think is that we have to go to the policy  makers and try to convince them about change towards competitive electric  markets.  Then we can help them think through about the benefits of change  and the opportunity costs of not changing.  After that we would try to  understand, together with them (and they should know more), the difficulties  or challenges to achieve a vision of the electric inductry (that we should  try to develop with them).  Then we would help them design a strategy for  change and with implementation.  I am convinced that the closer we work and  the more we know about what is going on the better.    The document finally addresses specific issues and presents some discussion  points related to those isues as well as possible solutions.    You will recognize big chunks of this document as it builds upon your  Electric Continuum and on Mark Shroeder's group Competitive Electric Markets,  Key Factor For Success.

We will be discussing the pros & cons of each region's rise.  Try to decide if the ECB or the FT editorials (today pp. 12 & 13) are correct on the need for the ECB rate increase.  II) You might also glance at articles on falling real estate prices in Japan (p. 4), and the article on Daewoo's bankruptcy (p. 12).  III) Yesterday's FT had a long editorial on markets for the inputs into global warming (Thurs. 11/4, p. 14).  What are the pros and cons of markets for controlling externalities of this global sort?  IV) Hint: A typical set of exam questions might be... Consider one of the following nations that have had special sections in the FT this term: Ireland, Brazil or Ghana. 1. What is are 1 or 2 of the most serious threats to short-run growth in GDP for this nation? 2. What short-run fiscal or monetary policies are appropriate? 3. What is are 1 or 2 of the most serious threats to short-run growth in GDP for this nation? 4. What longer-term policies are appropriate?

2022-04-05 13:35:34+00:00,true,5,"  Thanks for your note - hope you have time for a little fun while you're in SF  - or at least some good food.  The Moorings said they should be able to put your part on the credit card if  you want.  Their number is 800-535-7289; our contract number is 507645 and  it's under my name.  The guy I talked to said he'll have to call during  regular business hours when the bookkeeping department is open.  Each  person's share is currently $905.33.  That includes one night in the Moorings  hotel so will go down by 55.50 or so if you decide not to stay there at all.   Beverages are covered by a separate payment.  I'll be glad to fax the invoice  when you get a number for me.  If you want to send me your check, that's  fine, or Bruce can do it - makes no difference to me.  Regarding ""connectedness,""  there were no internet cafes the last time I was  there.  While that may have changed, there won't be more than one or two in  the entire place, I'm sure.  Were you planning on bringing your laptop?  If  so, it would make sense to find a 12 volt charger cable that will plug into a  lighter socket or bring extra batteries - we won't have 110 volt current on  the boat except the first - and maybe one other - night.  It will be easy to  check voice mails since we will have a cell phone on board.  But it's not  cheap (as I remember it it was $1/min. to receive a call from the States and  $2/min. to place one) and I'm reasonably comfortable that you won't be able  to plug into it.  I'm not sure if your US cell phone will work there or not.   We can find out from the Moorings.  I have an international cell phone I'm  bringing along that also has infrared capability.  Does your laptop have one  of those ir receivers?  If so, I can bring along the software you need to  work it with this phone.  Not to be defeatist and I'm sure the times have  changed but I remember one trip 7 or 8 years ago where a friend needed to  receive & send some faxes so we stopped at a little island hotel and asked if  we could use their fax machine - they said yes but had never seen anyone send  or receive more than a 2 or 3 page fax before and our 50 and 60 pagers soon  ran the machine out of paper.  When we asked for more paper it turns out we  had used the last piece on the island - they were not amused.    Ted asked me to remind you to be thinking about music.  Let me just add in  the spirit of self-preservation that it's a good idea.  It's not safe to  ignore this issue since if we leave him to his own devices we may not hear  much other than Van Halen and Iron Maiden.  Obviously feel free to bring as  many of your own cd's as you want & if you let us know what types of tunes  you like we'll try and bring ours (if any) that match.  Don't worry too much  about Ted's taste - I always insist that he bring along a Walkman &  headphones!  Glad to hear the company is doing well, but just in case you need some ideas  with some of your projects, I got this from a friend this morning:  The tribal wisdom of the Dakota Indians, passed on from one generation to the next, says that when you discover you are riding a dead horse, the best strategy is to dismount.  However, in modern business, because of the heavy investment factors to be taken into consideration, often other strategies have to be tried with dead horses, including the following:       1.   Buying a stronger whip.      2.   Changing riders.      3.   Threatening the horse with termination.      4.   Appointing a committee to study the horse.      5.   Arranging to visit other sites to see how they ride dead horses.      6.   Lowering the standards so that dead horses can be included.      7.   Appointing an intervention team to reanimate the dead horse.      8.   Creating a training session to increase the riders load share.      9.   Reclassifying the dead horse as living-impaired.      10.  Change the form so that it reads: ""This horse is not dead.""      11.  Hire outside contractors to ride the dead horse.      12.  Harness several dead horses together for increased speed.      13.  Donate the dead horse to a recognized charity, thereby deducting           its full original cost.      14.  Providing additional funding to increase the horse's performance.      15.  Do a time management study to see if the lighter riders would           improve productivity.      16.  Purchase an after-market product to make dead horses run faster.      17.  Declare that a dead horse has lower overhead and therefore performs           better.      18.  Form a quality focus group to find profitable uses for dead horses.      19.  Rewrite the expected performance requirements for horses.      20.  Promote the dead horse to a supervisory position.",Thanks for your note - hope you have time for a little fun while you're in SF or at least some good food.

I advised Argentina that we were making no other changes to our format other  than removing the CSA since this seems to be the major issue for TGS.   However, we may want to hold off on sending the 2nd draft until commercial  has a chance to advise TGS of our position.  I want to make sure that the CSA  is really the only hurdle for them before we send the revised draft down.

2022-04-05 21:13:19+00:00,true,5,"  I am visiting Haas this year and will be teaching 'European Financial Markets' (BA 296-7, E 296-5) in the spring. Since this is a new course, I thought I should draw it to your attention. The move to monetary union (EMU) in Europe has created a newly integrated financial area comparable to the US, with consequences that anyone doing business or advising businesses in Europe needs to understand. Just consider:  'The dollar's supremacy has been challenged in the global debt markets.' (FT, 6/14/99).  'The large funds have indulged in a frenzy of cross-border buying...with the volume of paper launched by European companies rising five-fold over 1998.' (FT 10/28/99)   '...a doubling of European-based staff at Lehman Brothers, a 50% increase at SSB, and up to 20% at other banks...follows Europe overtaking the US in M&A activity...' (FT 10/25/99)  I shall address questions such as: How does the European Central Bank differ from the Fed? Will the euro compete with the dollar as an international currency? Can European capital markets challenge the US for international portfolio managers and for non-European issuers? Will Europe soon have serious venture capital and junk bond sectors? Will the European banking sector experience a deep wave of cross-border restructurings? Will there be a shift from domestic to cross-border M&A in Europe - and will competition authorities try to restrain it? How will the East European emerging markets fit into the picture?  If these issues interest you, I look forward to seeing you in January.  -- Richard Portes Distinguished Global Visiting Professor Haas School of Business University of California at Berkeley Berkeley CA 94720-1900 Email: portes@haas.berkeley.edu Tel. 1 510 642 8032 Fax 1 510 642 4700 (on leave from London Business School, 1999-2000) ","I am visiting Haas this year and will be teaching 'European Financial Markets' (BA 296-7, E 296-5) in the spring.

2022-04-05 14:50:41+00:00,true,5,"  As presently drafted the ETA provides that if a master agreement is in force  covering a particular transaction, the master controls.  I don't think we  ever adequately resolved the multiple Enron entity issue, though.  For  example, if a counterparty has an ISDA Master Agreement in place with ENA,  that master agreement could easily cover a trade based on UK gas prices.   However, it is not the commercial people's intent that the system work that  way.  They want every trade for a particular product to be with a single  Enron entity (e.g. all UK gas transactions are with Enron Europe), regardless  of what master agreements are in place.  To resolve this I suggest that the  long descriptions be revised to state the Enron trading entity for each  product type (this is already in place for European derivatives) and that the  ETA be revised as follows:  revise the fifth line of paragraph (a) of Section 3 such that Transactions  are governed by the short and long definitions in respect of a product  ""...and any master agreement between Counterparty and the Enron entity  trading in such product on the Website which is in effect as of the date of  the execution of such Transaction...""

2022-04-05 18:25:21+00:00,true,5,"  Jeff I am responding to your question to Ben Campbell regarding the October 26, OFO.  Below is a portion of the explanation I prepared so the Customer Services folks could respond to others who had questions.  Following is a partial recap of the Plans, Plan versions, and times that lead to calling the OFO on Monday for the gas day of Tuesday, October 26. Plan 1 prepared at 06:38 AM on October 25 was used to make the decision to call for the OFO effective on Tuesday.  The version of the plan printed at 6:38 AM was used to make the OFO decision but this plan was not posted to the Pipe Ranger.  After the OFO decision was made and announced to the market, the Golden Gate Market Center called to inform the Sr Transmission Coordinator that non core customers had request approximately 205 Mdth of total non core withdrawal rights so this request was included in the planning process even though the gas had not yet been scheduled.  This version of the plan with the tentative (but not scheduled) non core withdrawal was posted to the Pipe Ranger at approximately 8:08 AM. The additional withdrawal increased the system inventory to a level above that which we would call for an OFO.  It has been our policy not to recind OFO announcements once the market has begun to make adjustments and in this case the additional withdraw had not been nominated or scheduled.  If the OFO had been recinded it is quite possible the the withdrawal may not have been scheduled.  Our criteria for calling OFOs remains what was outlined in the OFO Settlement agreement which was met according the Plan produced at 6:38 AM but not posted to the Pipe Ranger.  The later Plan which was posted to Pipe Ranger incorporated later information and therefore indicated that the OFO criteria that we are using was not met - hence the confusion.  > To make sure that the market sees the information we use to make OFO > decisions, we  have issued explicit instructions to the Sr. Transmission > Coordinators to post the plan they use to make the OFO decision. > Please call or email if you have additional questions.   <<...>>      Jack Dunlap 223-2039","Jeff, I am responding to your question to Ben Campbell regarding the October 26, OFO.

2022-04-05 22:32:29+00:00,true,5,"  By Michael Rieke  11/02/1999 Dow Jones Energy Service  (Copyright (c) 1999,  Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)       HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) is currently testing hardware and  software in order to start trading telecommunications  bandwidth capacity early next month.    The installations, in New York City and Los Angeles, are key steps in a  pioneering proposal that could create a market worth ""hundreds of  billions of dollars a year,"" Tom Gros, Enron Communications vice president  of global bandwidth trading, told Dow Jones Newswires.    Enron has proposed trading Time Division Multiplexing, or TDM, and Internet  Protocol, or IP, bandwidth. TDM is used mostly for voice  transmission and IP is used mostly for data transmission.    In non-technical terms, TDM and IP have been compared to two different  systems for moving commuters. TDM is comparable to a rail  system moving commuters by train, with only one train at a time moving on  the track between two points. IP is comparable to commuters  moving in smaller groups in several cars between the same two points. The  route between those two points can be used by other  commuters (or other data) at the same time.    In other words, TDM sends one signal at a time between two points. IP breaks  a single transmission of data into packets of data, moves  them to another point where they are reassembled into one message. With IP,  packets of many separate data transmissions can be sent  simultaneously over a path.    Trading of TDM bandwidth will start in December and trading of IP will start  early next year, Gros said. Trading will begin with TDM  because it's a more liquid market.    Three types of TDM bandwidth will trade: DS-3, OC-3 and OC-12. DS-3 moves  about 45 million bits per second, OC-3 moves 155.52  Mbps and OC-12 moves 622 Mbps.    Enron's proposal would establish a master agreement covering quality  specifications and the delivery mechanism for trading bandwidth as a  commodity.    After companies sign that agreement, all their trades would be covered by  it. Individual deals could then be negotiated over the phone to  cover price, time period, segment and quantity in a few minutes, Gros said.    The standard terms and conditions Enron has come up with should make deals  happen more quickly, said Amanda McCarthy, an analyst  for Forrester Research, a technology research company.    Each deal's contract would be confirmed the same day by facsimile or  electronic communication between the buyer and seller. They would  be unregulated, over-the-counter transactions.    If a company fails to make or take delivery according to the deal  specifications, it would be subject to liquidated damages.    By installing the hardware and software needed for trading, Enron will  become the first pooling point developer called for in its proposal.  The hardware and software will establish connections with other carriers,  enabling trades of TDM bandwidth capacity between New York  and Los Angeles.    The path between New York and Los Angeles is the most liquid in North  America, Gros said. It's also an excellent launching point to  connect with European and Asian markets.    Because that path is volatile, it will motivate industry players to mitigate  price risk and will give speculators trading opportunities, according  to Enron's proposal.    Developers will build up to 100 other pooling points in North American  cities in the next 24-36 months, Gros said. Those pooling points  will allow bandwidth between other pairs of cities to trade under the  standard terms and conditions.    As many as 100 more pooling points will be built outside of North America,  particularly in Western Europe and the Pacific Rim, creating a  global market for bandwidth, he said.    Enron Chairman Ken Lay said recently that bandwidth would be trading under  Enron's proposal in Europe by the first half of next year and  in Asia by the second half of next year.    Enron is willing to build all the pooling points, at a cost of ""a few  million dollars"" each, Gros said. But other companies also are interested in  being pooling point developers. ""Once we build the first two and prove the  concept, we're looking forward to pretty healthy competition  for people who want to be pooling point developers.""    Having Enron own any of the pooling points is a problem, said Forrester's  McCarthy. ""Enron is not a disinterested party. It has its own  network and (it) owns hubs, so a company like AT&T won't fully participate  in that market. The idea of a neutral third party is important,""  she said.    Gros said Enron has addressed that potential problem with the concept of a  pooling point administrator, or PPA. The PPA, a neutral third  party, would help to arrange physical delivery of the bandwidth. The PPA and  both parties to the trade would monitor quality of service  and other terms of the deal as it runs its course.    Enron is talking to PricewaterhouseCoopers about being the pooling point  administrator. PricewaterhouseCoopers already has been  working with Enron for months to develop the role of the pooling point  administrator.    Pooling point developers will have to build to meet specifications of the  bandwidth trading organization, or BTO, Gros said. The bandwidth  trading organization will be made up of traders in industry and will be  authorized to approve pooling point developers and the pooling point  administrator.    ""We hope that...by the end of the first quarter of 2000, we (will) have the  founding members of the trading organization,"" Gros said. ""That's  not a firm date but a reasonable time frame.""    The BTO wasn't part of the original trading proposal Enron released in May.  It was added recently to help allay any fears about Enron or  any other company developing and owning pooling points.    Some skeptics doubt there will be a rush to sign up for the BTO or to accept  Enron's proposal for trading. They cite what they call a poor  turnout at Enron's ""industry summit"" in September in California.    Gros wouldn't name specific companies that attended the meeting. He said  only that it was attended by telecommunications ""carrier firms  that have significant physical capacity in the Pacific, Atlantic and North  American segments."" There were also hardware firms and ""a couple  of consulting firms represented.""    An attendee, who didn't want to be identified, said only two carriers  attended, Global Crossing Ltd. and Williams Communications Group.  ""They were having a tough time with (the proposal),"" he said.    Gros said Enron had the turnout it expected. Attendance was limited  purposely so the meeting would be a round-table discussion. ""We  turned away dozens who had asked to come,"" Gros said.    He isn't bothered by skeptics. Enron encountered skeptics when U.S. natural  gas and electric power markets were commoditized in the  last two decades, he said. The company worked to establish both of those  markets and now it is the largest player in each of them. It also  plans to be a ""first-mover"" in the bandwidth market.    When trading starts in December, Enron will be a market-maker, buying or  selling as needed to get the market moving, Gros said.    And he won't be discouraged if the market doesn't grow quickly. The  commodity market for gas and power each took off slowly, he said.    Instead, he continues to promote the benefits of a bandwidth commodity  market. ""Even if you don't own any physical capacity, it will be so  easy for you in...a couple of phone calls to effectively nail up a national  or possibly international telecommunications grid.""    If the market develops as Enron has predicted, it could prevent major  headaches for telecommunications carriers and their customers.    When Uunet, a unit of MCI Worldcom Inc. (WCOM), had a system problem  recently, the Chicago Board of Trade, one of its customers,  lost its online trading system for a few days.    ""If bandwidth had been trading as a commodity when MCI had its problems last  month, it would have given the company a range of  choices to solve the problem,"" said Forrester's McCarthy.    Gros agreed. A real-time market in bandwidth could develop. If that market  had existed when Uunet had its problem, the CBOT would  have been able to get its online trading system back up ""in a matter of  minutes or hours,"" he said.    -By Michael Rieke, Dow Jones Newswires, 713-547-9207  michael.rieke@cor.dowjones.com ","By Michael Rieke 11/02/1999.

2022-04-05 20:20:41+00:00,false,5,"  Srikanth Hari sent the following BusinessWeek ANALYSIS & COMMENTARY I thought others might want to read...   Software: A New Calculus for the New Economy How reclassifying it as an investment boosts growth  The U.S. truly has seen the birth of a New Economy over the past several  years. That's one way to read the results of a comprehensive revision of historical data on the gross domestic product released on Oct. 28 by the Commerce Dept.'s Bureau of Economic Analysis.  The most stunning data in the report are about the acceleration of  productivity in the 1990s. Official revisions of productivity data, incorporating the  latest output figures from Commerce, won't be released by the Labor Dept. until Nov. 12. But a BUSINESS WEEK analysis of the new data from the Commerce Dept. shows that nonfarm business productivity growth in this decade will likely be  revised upward, to roughly 2% a year, from 1.4%. Productivity growth will be boosted for the 1980s as well, but not by as much (chart).  What's even more striking is the upward revision in productivity growth for  the last three years, from 1.9% to a stunning 2.6% rate. That explains how the  U.S. has been able to grow at a 4.2% rate over that stretch without creating inflationary pressures.  KEEPS ON TICKING. While the rate of increase in economic output in the 1990s isn't as impressive as the growth in productivity, it is not as low as the old statistics indicated. From 1990 through 1998, the Commerce Dept. statisticians say, the economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1%--about even with the 1980s growth rate of 3.2%. And, the report confirms what everyone senses: Growth has accelerated recently. Commerce revised the economy's growth rate for 1996-98 upward to an average of 4.2% from a previously reported 3.8%.  By comparison, annual average GDP growth for the entire 40-year span covered  by the revisions was pushed upward to 3.4% from 3.2%. The implication of the revisions: The U.S. economy may now be able to sustain a higher rate of growth without inflation than was previously believed.  The Commerce Dept. now says that the GDP last year was $8.76 trillion, which  is about $250 billion--or 3%--higher than previously believed. A new calculus for software investments accounted for about two-thirds of the upward revision in GDP. And since software sales are growing far faster than the economy as a whole, adding them into the GDP raises the economy's official growth rate--and will likely continue doing so for years to come.  Indeed, the biggest factor in the Commerce Dept.'s revisions is the new way of accounting for software, the poster product of the New Economy. The government now treats software purchases by business and government as investments, which are part of GDP. Until now, the only software sales that counted toward GDP were sales to consumers and the sale of software that came bundled with computers and was included in the computer's purchase price. Now all software sales are factored into the GDP figures.  The new treatment of software isn't just some statistical trick. Until now, software spending by business and government was considered an expense, and expenses are left out of GDP to avoid double-counting. For instance, it would be double-counting to list the steel that goes into a car as part of GDP and count the car, too.  But software is not consumed in the production of new goods and services. And the government is acknowledging now that software shouldn't be considered an expense such as steel or stationery. It's being reclassified as an investment, like a machine tool, in recognition that it has a useful life of at least a year.  PIGGY-BANK BLOAT. By recognizing software as an investment instead of an expense, the Commerce Dept. also increases the national savings rate. Savings are the mirror image of investment. While the national savings rate was  revised downward for 1959-73, it was revised upward for the years since. The biggest revision was for the most recent year covered: 1998. The government now says that total national savings were 18.8% of gross national product last year, a jump of 1.5 percentage points from the previous calculation. Of that increase, fully 90% was accounted for by the government's recognition of business and government software purchases as an investment.  The Commerce Dept. also rejiggered the composition of the national savings accounts, raising personal savings while lowering government savings by an equal amount. That's because of a new way of accounting for government pension plans, contributions to which are now considered a form of personal rather  than governmental savings.  The reshuffling means that the personal savings rate is now calculated as 3.7% for 1998 instead of a previously reported 0.5%. The new methodology will undoubtedly turn the current personal savings rate from negative to positive. But since the government's savings fell by a corresponding amount, the reshuffling had no impact on the overall national savings rate. And the downward trend in personal savings is still in place. By the new measure, the personal savings rate declined from 10.9% in 1982 to 3.7% last year, instead  of from 9% to 0.5% as had been previously reported.  KINDER HINDSIGHT. The GDP revisions were wide-ranging and included hundreds of large and small tweaks. For instance, the government is now using a better way to measure the value of banking services such as automated teller machines and electronic funds transfers. That increases the sector's official output and productivity. Also, new inflation measures developed by the Labor Dept. are being incorporated all the way back to 1978, not just since 1995.  One footnote: The government now says the recession of 1990-91 was milder than previously thought. From its peak in the second quarter of 1990 to its trough in the first quarter of 1991, GDP fell 1.8%. The old figure was a 2.7% drop.  The Commerce Dept.'s rewrite of economic history doesn't mean that the Federal Reserve can afford to be any less vigilant about inflation. Regardless of the official growth rate, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has to keep his eye on the same warning signs: tight job markets, busy factories, rising commodity  prices. The real significance is that government statistics are finally reflecting the reality of the high-growth, high-productivity, low-inflation New Economy.  By Peter Coy in Washington   My comments:         The article is a bit unclear on whether software was ever counted.   The key point is that the value of software not yet depreciated is a percent or  2of GDP.  Thus, GDP is a few % larger than the old accounting system that expensed all software immediately.  Consider your own desktop: What % of your salary is the market value of the software you have on the machine?  (Not the original cost, as Word95 has a very low market cost, even if it was $500 4 years ago.)  David I.

As you probably already know, the flight from Beijing was a record  first for the GV into Houston.  I have met and discussed the possibility of the GV replacing a 900B or a  total fleet transition at length with John Stabler, Ron Fain and Keith  Jones.  I have prepared a spread sheet showing the affect on budget as well  as our thoughts and recommendations.    Although the cabin size of the Global Express is larger, Gulfstream is a good  two years ahead of the Global in deliveries and fleet size.  They have  overcome the mechanical problems that were experienced earlier in the  program,  problems that  the Global Express may still be facing.  Worldwide  support and operational experience have the Gulfstream far ahead of the  Global Express.

What is the minimum size or price which can be transacted on EnronOnline?  The minimum and maximum size is different for each product and is specified  by the Enron trader who is responsible for that product.  It may vary from  time to time.

The OPIC  authorization bill was passed by a big margin, the Defense Appropriation bill  giving the President authority to extend the exemptions on India sanctions,  success with the Trade Adjustment Act language important to a problem raised  ""recently"" by PGE, good news on Cong. Barton's willingness to consider some  positive language in the electricity restructuring bill, etc. Yesterday,  Sudaker Rao called me from the Indian Embassy to read me a letter Ambassador  Chandra wrote to Dean O'Hair , chair of the US-India Business Council  thanking them and Enron by name for the success on the sanctions effort. Our  US WTO Energy Services Coalition grew to 40 members and next week we lead the  US-Bolivia Business Partnership on its trip to Bolivia to meet with President  Banzer and others in the Bolivian political and business leadership.   At Enron, Ken frequently cites the Enron people who involve themselves in  making things happen. I think the items cited above are examples of what Ken  says to all of us. Ken and Rosalee are always ready to get involved as they  did in moving the position letter signed by Ken in the OPIC issue. My group  did the preparation of the letter and moved it to the Hill in a timely  fashion.

This over-all effort on the OPIC  issue was repeated on all of the other matters assigned.  It is very rewarding to be part of an organization that constantly works to  win. Ken's right; people do make the difference at Enron. Thanks to all.

Some amendments  were passed, however, none of them were ""killers"" for Enron interests.  The  bill will now go to conference and we hope to have final legislation in the  immediate future.  More information to follow.  Thought you'd like the most up-to-date news.  Chris Long     ",Joe Hillings: I think that I speak for the rest of the team when I say how grateful we are that we are there to help us in WDC. All of this would not be possible without the hard work and initiative shown by you and your team in DC. Thank you. Sanjay Hilling

2022-04-05 09:07:41+00:00,true,6,"  The attachment to the below message from the law firm of Winthrop, Stimsom,  Putnam &Roberts is a very well done summary of the Kyoto Protocol.  I  attended  the American Society for Quality Energy and Environmental Division  conference last week and was impressed by this presentation.  Enron is  mentioned significantly in this paper and since I was the only Enron employee  in attendance I got a lot of questions from other conferees about who we are  and what we do.  Thank goodness I paid attention at the new hire orientation  last month.  I believe there are many others at Enron who would enjoy reading  this and will let your office make that distribution.  It looks best printed  on a good color printer.  ","The attached to the below message from the law firm of Winthrop, Stimsom, Putnam &Roberts is a very well-documented summary of the Kyoto Protocol.

2022-04-05 09:15:10+00:00,true,6,"  Ken,  Attached is the agenda for Enron's upcoming Management Conference.  I've  received valuable input from numerous members of Enron's management team and  this is the result.  While it is quite a departure from the traditional  conference agenda, I think it will prove to be engaging and  thought-provoking.  I'll look forward to your input.  If you are comfortable with the agenda, I'd like to send a copy of it to the  Executive Committee accompanied by a memo from the Office of the Chairman  explaining the goals and objectives for the conference.  It is important that  senior management understand the change in format and their role, if any, on  the agenda.  (I recognize that some executives look forward to presenting at  this conference and their absence from the agenda may be an issue for them.)  I am working with some talented people to create a slide template for all  presenters.  We're also asking that all presenters use PowerPoint.  A  standardized template and format will ensure that all the presentations, even  those from external presenters, have a similar look and feel.   I'll run that  template by you as soon as it is finalized.  Please let me know if you have any questions, comments or concerns.

2022-04-05 10:23:32+00:00,true,6,"  I wanted to provide you an update on where we stand related to several recent  contribution requests.  Tom Delay's Request -- We did fulfill the $10,000 request that came to us  from Tom and Christine Delay for the Fort Bend Child Advocates.  In addition,  we've arranged with Heather for your family's foundation to match Enron's  gift.  I spoke directly with Christine Delay several times and they are very  appreciative of the gifts and our efforts to correct the initial oversight.  YMCA --  I've had multiple conversations with Heather about a combined  Enron/Lay Family contribution to the YMCA.  According to Heather, you and  Linda have agreed to contribute $500,000 and ask that Enron match.  We are,  of course, willing to do that.  I am scheduling a meeting with Bill Phillips  of the YMCA to discuss the gift.  We will be talking to him about naming  opportunities as well as the YMCA's consideration of extending services to  Enron employees at the downtown YMCA, as well as outlying facilities.  (FYI:   The downtown YMCA recently chose to cancel the agreement we'd had with them  allowing Body Shop members to utilize the facility.)  Other Capital Campaigns -- We are currently evaluating several other capital  contribution requests.  Each is outlined below.  We are proceeding in several  ways.  First, I am scheduling a meeting with Marty Sunde to discuss EES's  interest in pursuing energy service agreements with these not-for-profit  institutions.  As you know, EES is focusing its current efforts on much  larger scale energy portfolios.  Secondly, I am working to evaluate these  requests based on the leveraging opportunities associated with each.   Finally, we want to be equitable in our giving to these local campaigns as  well as consistent in our giving philosophy.  We are working to balance these  requests relative to each other and to our goal to transfer dollars away from  multi-year gifts toward programs.  Texas Heart Institute -- I had breakfast yesterday with Bob Devlin, Dr.  Denton Cooley, Jack Doherty and Meredith Long.  They shared with me plans for  a new Texas Heart Institute building in the Medical Center.  (The building  will bear a striking resemblance to our buildings -- oval in shape and bluish  glass.)  They are conducting a $75 million campaign -- $42 million to build  and equip the building and $33 million to sustain programs in research and  education.  They are requesting $1 million from Enron and will allow us to  specify how the gift is spent.  American General and Shell Oil Foundation  have each contributed $1 million  Baylor College of Medicine -- Amy Lee and I had lunch last week with several  folks from Baylor.  They are in the midst of a campaign to fund their many  programs in research and education.  We discussed opportunities to expand our  existing medical-based literacy program - Prescription for Reading.  They  also outlined for us numerous other sponsorship opportunities.  No specific  dollar amount was requested.  While several pharmaceutical companies have  contributed in the $500,000 to $1 million range, most of our local peers are  within the $100,000 to $500,000 range.  University of Houston - MD Anderson Library and the Honors College -- As you  know, the University is requesting $500,000 from Enron over 5 years to  support renovation of the library.  Since our call with Harriet Latimer, I've  conducted some research to determine what other local corporations are  contributing.  Currently, no companies have made a financial commitment.  In  fact, only Compaq and Shell have committed at all with in-kind  contributions.  While I am confident that we will support this in some way, I  am particularly interested in speaking with Steve Barth and Chet Gladchuck at  the University to determine if the library could be rolled into the energy  services agreement we are currently evaluating with the University's athletic  department.  On a separate note, you'd forwarded to me a request from the University to  fund a publication ""The Future of International Education:  Directions &  Opportunities.""  Elyse Kalmans discussed this with her contacts at U of H.   They indicated that this was not a high priority for them and would rather  have Enron commit its resources to other University endeavors, such as the  library.  We have chosen to decline this request.  I apologize for the length of this memo.  However, I did want to keep you  updated on the status of these various requests.  I will present  recommendations to you on each of these pending requests in the coming  weeks.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or comments, please  contact me.
