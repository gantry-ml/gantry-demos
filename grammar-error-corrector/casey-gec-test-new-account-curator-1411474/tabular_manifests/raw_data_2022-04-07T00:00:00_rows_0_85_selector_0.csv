From:  Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon   In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the=20 implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the=20 continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our=20 people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets= ,=20 and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both=20 within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the= =20 corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce th= e=20 following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the= =20 Commercial Transactions Group within ENA.  1) Coverage/Origination:  To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product= =20 technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20 businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated= =20 under the leadership of Dave Delainey : a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals,= =20 co-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s; b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a= =20 broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20 including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an= d=20 mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,= =20 textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20 Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.  Downstream Coverage/Origination  As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha= t=20 the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both= =20 ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand= =20 its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20 solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron= =20 Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function= =20 will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener= gy=20 commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti= es=20 but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic= als,=20 plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional= =20 capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels= =20 groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper= =20 will be returning from Portland to manage this business.

We hav= e=20 asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20 formerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of= =20 Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join= =20 this newly formed business.  2) Commercial Transactions:=20  The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20 Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of= =20 transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex= ecuting=20 transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity= =20 of client coverage.

The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,= =20 execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction= =20 with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of= =20 which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This= =20 dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service= =20 and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20 resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to= =20 the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:  a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and= =20 Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20 include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy= =20 Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the Vice-President of= =20 Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today= =20 from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20 origination. b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr= ial=20 origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20 Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is= =20 established.  The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay= =20 Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.  We anticipate announcing= =20 two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks. c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant= =20 Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.  The seni= or=20 members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a= nd=20 John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the= =20 Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.  We= =20 anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few= =20 weeks. d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20 Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of this team inclu= de=20 Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition= =20 of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.  Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and= =20 Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary= =20 responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.  Andrea Reed will= =20 continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior= =20 commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua= l=20 responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20 Capital Structuring Group.  The remaining four groups within CTG will remai= n=20 largely unchanged.  In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20 Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located= =20 together.  We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag= e=20 and industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri= al=20 markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe= en=20 the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20  Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor= th=20 America by working with us to implement these changes.","To: Enron North America Corp.

2022-04-07 04:04:31+00:00,true,1,"  Vince-  I have a simplified version of Brad's model in mind.  The ""no arbitrage"" condition equates trading margins across the country.  Costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network. Wellhead supply is  almost completely price- elastic, while burner-tip demand is almost  completely price inelastic. Storage is rationalized as a perpetual call  option.  The least time-variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing  gas from storage to the pipeline, followed by the costs of delivering gas  from the wellhead to the pipeline. The intermediate-variant parameters are  the capacity-dependent costs paid to the pipeline (above shrinkage) for  transmission. The most time-variant parameters are the trading margins and  the valuations of the storage option.  There are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork.  They are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways: using a short  time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability  mentioned above, or point-estimates (""calibrations"") using only today's data  based on a node-based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with  the same region of origination, albeit markedly different terminus, price  versus capacity similarly, ""competing"" for outflows.  I will write this up for you in Scientific Word and present it to you at your  earliest convenience.  Clayton","Vince- I have a simplified version of Brad's model in mind.

2022-04-07 01:07:22+00:00,true,1,"  Based on the attached, NBP is extremely cheap!  While the level of required  premium over the current market price to buy back the shares is difficult to  determine, I wonder why we wouldn't take a hard look at buying Duke's units  (at no premium).  I see basically two paths:  First, a strategic investment  made in contemplation of buying the remainder of the NBP units back  (presumably at a premium over current prices)  and then contributing the NBP  investment into the new regulated entity structure (at higher values).    Second, at these prices the investment in NBP units compares favorably to  other acquisitions GPG is looking at, e.g. East Tennessee.  Even if the  contribution to the new entity doesn't occur, GPG could hold the Duke units  for an indefinite time period, report reasonably good incremental earnings  and cash flow and sell them back to the public at an opportunistic level.    What do you think?   ","Based on the attached, NBP is extremely cheap! While the level of required premium over the current market price to buy back the shares is difficult to determine, I wonder why we wouldn't take a hard look at buying Duke's units (at no premium).

2022-04-07 00:28:26+00:00,true,1,"  Vince and Vasant:  Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at  the East Desk, related to gas transmission:  Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example  might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay  $12.00 per month per 10,000 decatherms of capacity ($0.40 per day), a fixed  payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs (""shrinkage"") and 6.5% for  overhead expenses.  A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a  delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 (""basis""), and might call Brooklyn  and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 .  The trader's spread is  $0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would  offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.225 for firm capacity tomorrow.   As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have  an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity.  Also, many pipelines don't discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum  (""it's not worth their time to haggle"") (There is a further issue of  ""secondary markets"" not important to the model yet).  For South Texas and  Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take  (pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc).  And, once the trade is in the  system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline,  in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.

There are three 10-day peaking contracts for 50,000 Dthd each or a total of 150,000 Dthd of peaking  capability by delivery from the Cove Point pipeline into the east side of TCO's system. The gas can also go directly into Washington Gas Light or into PEPCO's Chalk Point electric generation facility.  The variable transport cost on Cove Point LNG is less than $0.005/Dth.  This gas was hedged by CES as baseload  withdrawal during the January 1999, but can be withdrawn any time before the end of the contracts which is 2/29/2000.  2.  The TCO storage is the CES retail storage.  Enron's contract with CES retail contains the withdrawal schedule for this storage.

2022-04-07 01:13:04+00:00,true,2,"  I will commit to writing the three items that I had hoped to discuss with you  today.  Feel free to get back with me via voice mail (x35926).  If you would  prefer to discuss any of these with me, you can reach me at home from  December 20-23 while I am on vacation.  My home number is 281-370-8568.  I  will be back at work for the week between Christmas and New Years.   1)  January 1:  Do you want me to call you that day after we have tested all  systems to give you a status update?  I can leave a voice mail for you at  your Enron number.  Or if you prefer, I would be happy to call you if you  will provide me with a number where you will be.  Cliff Baxter and several  key commercial personnel have asked that I call them after we have completed  our testing of all systems that support each commodity and product that we  trade in North America.  I will make these phone calls myself, and will  naturally treat all phone numbers that I have been given as confidential.   Please let me know your preference for notification.    2)  Definition of a global focus for trading operations:  Attached is a draft  memo that Rick Causey proposes to send.  This memo describes a coordination  role that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that  should be coordinated in all trading locations.  Please let me and/or Rick  know if you have any comments or suggestions.  I had hoped to briefly discuss  this with you in person, as I would want you to understand two points:  (1)  This role will not prevent me from continuing a very strong focus on the  needs of ENA.  I have worked very hard to assure a level of accuracy, control  and service in ENA operations.  Through that hard work, I believe that I have  your confidence in my ability to deliver results.  I  would do nothing to  jeopardize that.  (2)  There is a need for this coordination function, and  some one will play that role.  If I play that role, I can be in the best  position to influence outcomes with ENA's needs in mind.        3)   Gas Logistics:  I will talk with Whalley about my thoughts on this, but  I had wanted to make you aware that Jeff Shankman believes that he wants  logistics to report to him.  His stated reason to me is that he wants it to  ""look like power"".  I had wanted to discuss with you your thoughts on what   the criteria should be on which we make that decision.  I will propose to  Greg and Jeff that gas logistics should be located in direct proximity to the  regional traders in order to facilitate the flow of commercially viable  information about the pipes and capacity.  ( We have that now for the Central  and West desks, and should be able to make this happen as the 32nd floor is  built out for gas.)  I believe, however, that gas logistics should now report  to Brent Price, my business controller over gas for the East, Central and  West regions.  Brent would then have operations truly front to back (risk,  confirmations, scheduling and invoicing) and he sits on 31 and works very  closely with Jeff.   Also, Brent would be in the best position to ensure that  the logistics team meets requirements for timeliness and accuracy of  volumetric information so that we can achieve our target headcount reduction  in gas operations of 52 by year end 2000.  Without a continuing focus in  logistics on the downstream information needs, I will be concerned about our  ability to deliver our projected cost savings.  I also believe that Brent  will be in the best position to ensure minimal flash to actual variances.   While Greg and Jeff were certainly both with ECT in 1996 when we had an  earnings hit as a result of flash to actual variances, I am not sure that  either one was involved closely enough to appreciate the need for a strong  front to back focus to prevent these problems, and that includes holding  logistics accountable for their part in this.    I will let you know the outcome of my conversations with Greg and Jeff on  this issue.   ","I will commit to working on the three items that I have hoped to discuss with you today.

Since I value my friendships too much, I don't generally recommend people unless I really believe in who they are and what they are doing.  Bob is top notch, which is why I would feel comfortable recommending him to you and would be very pleased to introduce you to Bob because you are top notch as well.  I thought Bob had closed his fund already but he said he was going to have a second closing in about 30 days so there is still time to get in if you are interested.  The typical investment is in the $500k to $1m range although I know of one person who got in for $250k. ( I introduced him to Frevert and Rice and they have both invested.)  Bob is still in Houston and offices over in the Galleria area.  If you would like to talk to Bob, let me know when and where you can be reached and I will forward your information to him.

We are going to have to be able to put FTS-3 and FTS-1 capacity  into separate buckets for purposes of allocation (that is, allocation due to  circumstances such as, say, windowing by SoCal, &c.).  Here's why.  If  capacity became constrained on a given day and we allocated FTS-3 and FTS-1  together, FTS-1 service would essentially be enjoying the use of capacity  created by EFBH.  This is all well and good until EFBH cancels at the last  minute. Then you know what would happen:  FTS-1 would get cut because EFBH  cancelled.  I am told that this would necessarily happen because once FTS  schedules, it gets flowing gas rights.  To keep this scenario from happening,  we feel that FTS-3 will have to be put in its own bucket and not get cut  unless EFBH doesn't show up.

Rather than paying a reservation charge, the negotiated agreement  specifies that KGS will pay a volumetric rate.

I take issue with TVA's statement regarding denial of firm transmission to  our CA's (Enron CA is the sink).   TVA is correct with their statement  regarding netting of firm transmission (ie, very few transmission providers  net firm transmission).  However, TVA, in the implementation of the NERC  Policy letter, stated that they will make firm transmission available to and  from each control area equal to the capacity capability of the generation and  non-firm transmission availability from our control areas equal to TVA's own  ATC to and from each interconnected control area.  TVA's denial of firm transmission sinking to our control area for the reason  stated in Bill's e-mail is wrong.  Although the majority of our firm  transmission requests utilize the 3 control areas as sources (with POD's of  SOCO, EES, and AMRN), we should not tolerate denials of firm transmission  into our control areas because that is completely inconsistent with the NERC  Policy ruling.  By the way, what is the status of the transmission Terry requested from  Com-Ed to TVA (through Ameren)?  This would be a situation where our control  area would be a sink.  If TVA is, in fact, denying those firm transmission  requests where we are the sink, we need to print out a hard copy of the OASIS  denial and send a letter to NERC and FERC.

2022-04-07 03:37:09+00:00,true,6,"  Msg. from Rick Shapiro  I know how eagerly everyone is awaiting the formation of the Resource  Allocation Working group*.  Below is a brief description of the group's  purpose and initial steps we will be taking.  I want to thank everyone in  advance for what I know will be a successful effort.  What this group is about:       Identifying best practices within Public  Affairs for prioritization of efforts and allocation of resources and  documenting the best practices for implementation as soon as possible  throughout Public Affairs.  How we're going to do it:  Quickly and efficiently.  Why we're doing this:  Because we have finite human and financial  resources.... because we have an obligation to direct those finite resources  to their highest and best use.    When we're going to start this process:  Initial meeting in Houston, January  7, 2000 from 8:00am - 11:00am (call in participation is perfectly acceptable).  What's required for initial meeting:  A one page or less description of how  your group prioritizes its efforts; how both human and financial resources  are allocated, and how all of this fits within your budgeting process (should  be distributed to all group members two (2) days prior to meeting).  Finally:  I am attaching material that my group has used over the last year  to implement a resource allocation/issue priortization process.  I will  provide a more detailed explanation at the initial meeting.  Please feel free  to call me if you have any questions before then.  *  You've either been nominated or selected, or volunteered for this working  group.  Congratulations.   Copy of E:mail sent on 12/15/99 Please read the attached memo from Rick Shapiro along with the attachments.  Thanks.

Click on this link  -->     > Gov Affairs  > Projects  > Contacts  Instructions:  -->     Copy of E:mail sent on 8/25/99 Upon further reflection after the recent staff meeting, I have made the  determination that any and allengagements of outside resources, e.g., outside  counsel & consultants, public relations firms, etc... must be approved  through the Resource Commitment Review (RCR) process.  Accordingly, the $2500  trigger that had been in place is no longer.  To ensure that the process  works in a more timely manner, I am creating weekly RCR meetings (Harry, Jim  & myself) at which all pending RCR's will be acted on.  I will deal with  emergency RCR's as they may arise between the weekly meetings.  Bottom line, the RCR process is of enormous value to the group as it helps to  document that we are properly focusing the company's resources in the places  where it is of most value.  I firmly believe that whatever minor  inconveniences this change will entail, they are minor in relationship to  ensuring the success and credibility of the RCR process.

Articles 19 of the GATT requires that the WTO make progress on agriculture and services issues although it does not identify a date certain to achieve agreement..  Ambassador Barshefsky is committed to beginning services negotiations beginning in January.  A Committee on Specific Committments is charged with the responsibility to draft issues. The USTR wants to have a definition of issues from the ESC by the end of January to be submitted to the USG representatives on the Committee.  A second significant group in the process is the Working Group On Domestic Rights.This group is chaired by Peter Collins. Peter needs to know what are the domestic regulatory issues that could be raised by other WTO members as reasons not to liberalize various sectors. This information is to be supplied in the first half of 2000.  In late spring after group one and two have done a significant part of their work the USTR will be deciding what additional principles are needed to be tabled in the negotiation. They expect these working groups will begin to meet at the WTO by the end of next summer.  Three basic columns headed by (1) Market Access, (2) National Treatment, (3) Additional Committments (Could be proposed annex such as the process Tim Richards has proposed in our Electricity Working Group listing examples) is the format to be developed for the two groups.  Carol advised us that whatever we develop should be with the intention of getting Less Developed Countries (LDCs) supporting our basic principles in case a multilateral negotiation is not launched. We should work the current liberalization process being prosecuted in the APEC and FTAA negotiations..  The next phase of Carol's presentation addressed the recent response USTR received to the questions they submitted to DG 17 (it no longer exisits under the new commission) asking the EU to address their feelings about the liberalization of energy services.  We have not been given a copy of the EU response and Carol has asked Ms. Klinkers of the EU if the response can be shared with the ESC to secure industry responce. Carol and others from the USG attending the meeting are trying to ascertain just who drafted the responses which they characterized as ""confusing and not indicating a real understanding of the current practices and developments in the energy services sector.""  We do know that the USG has called this office to ask how they need to respond to the EU response that electricity is a good and not a service. Our immediate response is that this is a matter of some disagreement among EU members and the EU staff. The movement of electricity across national boundries may be a good but the sale and trading of electricity is definately a service.  The EU response we were told makes the agrument that in their view that many of the items raised in the October paper of the USTR were GAT covered such as construction, engineering, etc and therefore, may not need to be raised in the services negotiations although these items will at least need some sort of annex to make sure they are included.. The EU believes that if you own or operate electricity producting  then its a good but if you operate an IPP to sell electricity to various parties, its a service.  We were told that the EU response does not seem to understand or cover renewables such as wind and solar both of which are important in Europe's plan to diversify and develop green energy.  They also believe that price/risk management should be considered under finance services not energy services.   The session was then open to general discussion. Bob Fisher commented that the EU does not seem to understand the scope of today's energy services industry. That we now have a seemless web of energy services that has been developed. What about environmental services? Again, the EU response is confusted and incomplete. Apparently they feel that environmental services can be considered elsewhere in the negotiation.  Who from the EU drafted this paper? The staff has changed and we don't know how ""high"" in their heirarchy this was considered. Carol Balassa responded that she is trying to determine who drafted the response..  Brian Petty advised that his intelligence is that energy services is being discussed and considered at the highest levels of the Commission.   Carol told us that she is trying to get everything together before ""talking"" to the EU in January when she hopes to specifically respond and discuss their current returned response. Therefore, she is asking the Energy Services Coalition to complete the work of our four Working Groups which will allow the Hills people to develop the definition and basic negotiating position papers.  The DOS representative then suggested that we engage in some""capacity building."" This was defined as an outreach program to brief WTO member delegations on the meaning of energy services. Carol suggested that after her January meeting the EU could be agreeable to having our industry group meet with their representatives to explain how energy services has evolved and what is included in energy services.   We moved to a discussion of the definitions paper itself. Bob Fisher reminded those present that the current matrix developed for the APEC process was still an excellent guide to definitions although items such as renewables, heating and certain trading and financial services would need to be added. To meet some EU concerns that they are not a party to APEC and therefore suspicious of any such document, we should remove the reference to APEC.  Our group pointed to the Tim Richards paper developed for our Electricity Working Group which gives a broad definition but then contains a footnote known as the illustrative list which lists the various items that we believe constitute energy services under that heading. Bob Fisher said that this was the likely format we would ultimately adopt in the material prepared for USTR and others in the WTO process.  Bob said that once negotiators agree on the need for liberalized energy services they can ""fit"" whatever they want under the broad definition.  The last question raised was what happens to the ATL (accelerated tariff liberalization) which also covers some energy matters which WTO countries had contemplated being approved in Seattle. Carol said that she did not know.  The meeting then adjourned.   The ESC needs to complete the Working Group process and complete the questionaire at the earliest possible time to allow the Hills people to prepare the basic document. Working Group chairs are to be asked to complete this process by mid January.
