The Scheduling Procedure is the same one used in 2001.   CAISO Scheduling Procedure for Daylight Savings Time Transition   The following is a brief explanation of how SC's should prepare schedules for submission to the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure (SI) system for the upcoming conversion to Daylight Savings Time commencing on 4/7/02.  When submitting preferred or revised preferred schedules for Trade Date 4/7/02, which is considered a ""Short"" day, SC's should  schedule all 24 hours of information with the data for HE03 being zero.  The ISO's System Applications (SA) do not read or write data from/to the SI database for the ""Short"" day's HE03.  Therefore, no data will be sent to settlements for this hour.  Consequently, settlements will have only 23 records for this ""Short"" day, Trade Date 4/7/02.

2022-04-28 03:26:01+00:00,true,3,"  E-tag 1.7 Source and Sink Registration  The North-American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) has scheduled the implementation of E-tag 1.7 for April the 10th. One of the many enhancements in E-Tag 1.7 is the attempt to eliminate typographical errors. Therefore, NERC has urged every PSE to register their resources prior to the implementation of  E-Tag 1.7. If you are a pure marketer, with no direct ability to schedule a generator or serve a load, then you are not required to register. However, if you own generation, if you have an obligation to serve, or if you have the direct ability to schedule a resource, then you must register that resource. Entergy is encouraging our valued customers to register their sources and sinks. When registering your sources and sinks on the NERC website www.tsin.com, please follow the already existent Source/Sink naming convention.

The transition to Daylight Savings Time is rapidly approaching.  In preparation ISO Market Operations has provided the following Scheduling Procedure to help assure a smooth transition.  The Scheduling Procedure is the same one used in 2001.     CAISO Scheduling Procedure for Daylight Savings Time Transition     The following is a brief explanation of how SC's should prepare schedules for submission to the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure (SI) system for the upcoming conversion to Daylight Savings Time commencing on 4/7/01.    When submitting preferred or revised preferred schedules for Trade Date 4/7/01, which is considered a ""Short"" day, SC's should  schedule all 24 hours of information with the data for HE03 being zero.    The ISO's System Applications (SA) do not read or write data from/to the SI database for the ""Short"" day's HE03.  Therefore, no data will be sent to settlements for this hour.  Consequently, settlements will have only 23 records for this ""Short"" day, Trade Date 4/7/01.    If you have additional Scheduling questions for this trade date, please contact Alek Kandybenko, ISO Market Operations, @ (916)351-2213.     CAISO Metering Procedure for Daylight Savings Time Transition     The ISO receives all Settlement Quality Meter Data (SQMD) in PST, year around.    Therefore, the transition to DST should require no modification to meter data submission.    However, please confirm and assure that all SQMD meter data continues to be submitted to ISO MDAS in PST.    If you have additional ISO Metering questions for this trade date, please contact  ISO MDAS OPERATIONS, @ (916) 351-4431.   For any other questions please contact your Client Representative.

2022-04-28 12:11:34+00:00,true,3,"    Greetings:   Brad Carson and I had a productive telephone conversation with Caroline Emmert this morning. We agreed to proceed as follows to begin untangling the puzzle:   Bouse will forward the Excel file that recaps the payments and kWh's since the start of the Enron supply of electricity, November 2001. Note, that even though we have been far apart on a monthly basis, payments and invoices from November 2001 through February 2002 are very close together -- $2,500,850 compared to $2,500,912.  The Excel file with that information is attached.   Caroline has the ISO charges for November, December and January, and she will forward those to me via e-mail today.   Lisa Gang is now our Enron scheduler, and Caroline will check with Lisa to ascertain if she is using the daily input information from the Hanson Permanente cement plant. The cement plant has been forwarding information on the day ahead and week ahead usage on a routine during the whole period of Enron delivery. Caroline or Lisa will report to me if that information is being utilized.   The monthly billing from Houston (Gwen Williams) has not reflected actual usage at Hanson Permanente.  The invoice amounts from Enron reflect only the base numbers from CY 2000 that were imbedded in the contract for annual balancing.  Caroline will check to see what information Gwen is using for her monthly billing and to see if any of Lisa's or the cement plant's daily scheduling make their way to Gwen in Houston.   Hanson Permanente must know who is administrating this contract from the Enron side. By interpolation, we are assuming that the responsible party is Murray O'Neil who is Caroline's manager.  Do we have that right?  Lisa is our scheduler, Caroline is working with the ISO and PG&E true ups, Gwen is issuing Invoices based on Lisa's input and Murray is responsible for both Lisa and Caroline. Does that then mean that Murray is where the buck stops.    We may need to meet in the next 30 days to untangle this puzzle, and it would be beneficial for all parties to understand the organizational structure of each organization.   We look forward to working with you!   Sincerely.

April to May HLH drops from 1250 MW's to 1100 MW's while LLH drops from 900 MW's to 800 MW's. However, please plan on making May purchases today at a level equivalent to 50% of April forecast levels. I have provided a cash forecast to Kim Nelson based on 50% of April load forecast incorporating May forward prices, i.e., Kim is expecting to wire up to $15 million out this afternoon. As discussed before, you and M. Driscoll should plan on purchasing the remainder of EES base HLH and LLH needs next Tuesday (4/23). If May prices hold steady, Kim Nelson should expect to wire out another $10-$11 million on Tuesday (4/23). Just a reminder: please attempt to limit purchases from Avista.  EPMI May purchases: hold off executing purchases until I give the word. We should have a green light from the cash committee shortly.  Thanks.

2022-04-28 15:12:27+00:00,true,6,"  As Steve Cooper has mentioned in his voicemail messages, there will be an All-Employee Meeting this Thursday, April 11.  The meeting will be held at 8:30 a.m. (CST) in the Imperial Ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  Unfortunately, the full ballroom was not available until late May, but we did not want to put off the meeting until then. Capacity at the Hyatt will be limited to 1,400 people seated, with additional room for approximately 200 people standing.  As an alternative to attending the meeting, employees in Houston will be able to listen to a live audio stream and view the slide presentation on their computers at http://home.enron.com/employeemeeting/.  The question and answer portion of the meeting will not be broadcasted.  Shortly after the meeting, the audio broadcast and the slide presentation will be available for all employees at home.enron.com. Given the current environment and continuing media interest surrounding Enron, we will take extra security precautions at the Hyatt.  Employees attending the meeting will be required to show their current photo employee badge and each badge will be crosschecked with a current employee list.  No one will be permitted into the meeting without their badge.  Due to space constraints, contract workers will not be permitted to attend the meeting.  We recognize that this security process will take time, so check-in will begin at 7:45 a.m. We apologize for any inconvenience this process creates and appreciate your understanding and patience. We encourage you to submit questions for the meeting in advance.  Please send them via email to ""Office of the Chief Executive"".","As Steve Cooper has mentioned in his voicemail messages, there will be an All-Employee Meeting this Thursday, April 11.
