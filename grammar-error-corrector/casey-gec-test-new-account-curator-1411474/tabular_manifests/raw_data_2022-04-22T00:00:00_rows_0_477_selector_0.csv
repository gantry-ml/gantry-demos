Can I buy it for a 3-5 year period? Is there a published rate?  Marcos seemed to indicate he thought it would be available but it was unclear as to whether it would be sold term or what the price was - he made it seem like it was a case by case basis.

2022-04-22 00:01:11+00:00,true,2,"  Well, my holiday has almost ended and it has been both enjoyable and memorable.  I have met so many cool people over here, and seen so many awesome places.  Since the time of my last writing, I spent five days sailing around the Mediterranean with six other auzzies and kiwis.  The boat wasn't very full, and we had four crew members to ensure the seven of us were adequately fed and rested.  Morning started with breakfast, and was followed by long spells of sleeping, reading and swimming.  It reminded me alot of Torys cabin, except I didn't have to cook or clean the dishes (Tory, work on it...).  It was difficult to get off the boat, and the group spent several days afterwards laying around and doing next to nothing to ease ourselves back into the real world.  After the sailing, we spent four days in this awesome little town called Fethiye, and visited places such as the blue lagoon and hiked up to a waterfall in the Valley of the Butterflys.  We also went to a hike in this gorge, that was completely incredible.  At this point in the holiday, I was quite happy for the lax safety standards over here, because we climbed up many places in the gorge using nothing but the old ropes that someone had conveniently tied in place.  In one spot, we even had to climb vertically up a rope through a small waterfall!  I was quite pumped to head to this place called Olympos, where they have these treehouses to sleep in, but let the others go a day ahead while I finished my stuff in Fethiye.  When I got to Olympos, there wasn't much to do and one of the guys was pretty sick, so I only stayed the evening, and we carried on to the next place.  In hindsight, my decision to arrive late and leave early was a good one, because I was the only one of the seven who didn't end up getting really ill, whew!  We spent several days in this quant little village in the middle of the country, waiting for everyone to get better to travel, then headed to this place called Cappadocia, where they have these awesome hoodoo type rocks everywhere.  After arriving, I went exploring some really old churches carved into these rocks with a couple of girls from the hostel.  On the way home, we decided that hitchin would be easier than waiting for the bus, and met some really nice turkish men who were looking for a couple of nice women.  After several detours and a long journey, we were able to talk them into taking us back into town!  Last time I hitchhike in Turkey.  The next day, I headed off to explore the valley with the group of people from the sailboat.  We got lost for a while, and found an awesome house carved into this rock (kinda like a cavehouse).  It was many stories high, and we went exploring and ended up on the roof of the house, which was at the top of the valley.  I also got to sleep in one of these caves at the pansion where I was staying, which was quite a treat considering the caves are quite cool, and it was smoking hot outside!  The next day, we went to take a tour that we had arranged through another hotel, and ended up getting pulled over by the Jandarma (Turkeys version of the special police force). Turns out that our guide wasn't certified, and that we weren't supposed to be with him.  After a while of waiting, and some discussion, we were driven back to town and refunded our money.  We ended up finding another guide, and toured an underground city, saw some thousand year old churches, and saw where they filmed some scenes of the first starwars.  Our final day in Cappadocia, and one I will never forget, was quite scary. After a long hard night of partying in the Flintstones Cave Bar for my sendoff party (the others were going another direction and I was heading to Istanbul), we got up and decided to go for a hike down this place called the pigeon valley.  There were five of us, including two other auzzies that we had met the day before (four girls and one guy).  We hiked down this valley, and ended up coming to a very steep section that we had to climb down.  It wasn't very safe, and we were all pretty worried, but figured it was the only way down.  The girl was crouching on this thin trail, and slipped.  She ended up sliding down this rocky/sandy slope about twenty five feet on her belly, and managed to stop herself on the edge of a thirty foot cliff, all while the rest of us watched in horror.  A turkish guide had just shown up before she slipped, and he helped to get her back up an to safety.  Myself and another guy ended up climbing back up the rest of the cliff (we were only partway down), and found another turkish guide who led us down an easier way.  She was pretty shaken up, and had taken all of the skin off her elbows, knees, and finger tips (trying to gain a hold).  We got her back to town and spent several hours cleaning her up.  The two of them then came with me to Istanbul, and hopped on a plane back to London.  Very crazy!  The last couple of days I have been in Istanbul, and have seen the Royal palace, several really old mosques, and some amazing jewels (if you like 86 carat diamonds), and the bones of St. John the Baptiste.  I am going to tour again tomorrow, and maybe shop a little, then head back home to Calgary. Will see you all then!  Take Care!

2022-04-22 02:36:43+00:00,true,2,"  An event of Force Majeure occurred on Northern Border (NBPL) on July 13 at = Station 8 resulting in curtailment of deliveries through Ventura from July1= 3-18.  As a result, ENA was not able to take full delivery of firm volumes = from EC at the Monchy upstream interconnect.  EC and ENA hold divergent views on how to implement the curtailment.  We ne= ed to reach a common understanding.  The view of EC is that a force majeure event, as defined by Article 5 of ou= r master agreement with ENA (see Attachment) or superceded by amendments co= ntained in individual confirmation letters, implies that all firm transacti= ons must be curtailed ""by the same percentage that the applicable transport= er interrupts or curtails firm delivery service..."" (language in parenthese= s was directly lifted from a Monchy confirmation letter dated November 1, 1= 997 signed by Julie Gomez). =20  The view of ENA, as articulated by Martin and Lisa, is that Northern Border=  sends scheduled volumes back to Unify via EDI with a service agreeement pa= thed to a firm supply deal.  The pipeline scheduled volume for the path dri= ves how much each individual  deal is curtailed  even if some supply deals = are cut by a different percentage than others. My apologies if I have not e= xpressed this properly.  In other words, we agree on the magnitude of the curtailment but not how to=  allocate cuts to individual deals.  Because we have desk to desk deals (since earlier this year), ENA and EC mu= st agree on scheduled volumes.  In the past our deals were Physical Forward=  and if our volumes did not agree it was not discovered until invoicing, at=  which time the accountants would duke it out.  Now, Logistics quite proper= ly has to deal with it within the month.  This has implications at all poin= ts where ENA transacts with EC such as Kingsgate, Empress, Eastern Canada.  EC  has reluctantly agreed to accept ENA's non-proportional scheduled volum= es for this event so that the schedulers can move on but I would appreciate=  a policy resolution to this issue prior to the next downstream curtailment= .  Kevin Heal Enron Canada Corp. 403 974-6727  Attachment  Legal Opinion dated July 20, 2001  Kevin, further to your voice-mail, as indicated to you yesterday, our physi= cal gas master agreement with ENA is in their form of Enfolio master agreem= ent and not our form of master.  What that means is that, although the mech= anics of declaring force majeure, etc. are the same, the definition of forc= e majeure under our Enfolio master with ENA is not restricted to delivery p= oint force majeure as it is in ECC's standard form, but is rather a broader=  based force majeure.  However, it must be kept in mind that, depending on = the transaction, the definition of ""force majeure"" may be amended in the te= rms of the particular confirmation letter.  The application section (which = is basically the same as in our form) is as follows:  This Article 5 is the sole and exclusive excuse of performance permitted un= der this Agreement, and all other excuses at law or in equity are waived to=  the extent permitted by law.  Except with regard to payment obligations, i= n the event either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Ma= jeure to carry out its obligations hereunder, it is agreed that upon such P= arty's giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure to the othe= r Party as soon as reasonably possible (such notice to be confirmed in writ= ing), the obligations of the Party giving such notice, to the extent that t= hey are affected by such event, shall be suspended from the inception and d= uring the continuance of the Force Majeure for a period of up to 60 Days in=  the aggregate during any 12 Month period, but for no longer period.  The P= arty receiving notice of Force Majeure may immediately take such action as = it deems necessary at its expense for the entire 60 Day period or any part = thereof.  The Parties expressly agree that upon the expiration of the 60 Da= y period Force Majeure shall no longer apply to the obligations hereunder a= nd both Buyer and Seller shall be obligated to perform...  I will send a copy of the agreement over to you which also contains the def= inition of Force Majeure, but again it must be remembered that such definit= ion may be amended in the particular confirm.

We need to be sure what the Enron position is for purposes of the RTO settlements.    The concern that I am hearing from Dick is that Enron should not be supporting any process which requires disclosure of ultimate source or sink until time of scheduling.  From what I understand of the solution MISO proposes, there will be at least one leg with a ""fixed"" source and sink to be disclosed at time of reservation in order for a request to be approved.  Transmission redirect after approval and confirmation of this ""fixed"" leg could be a plausible solution - but I understand this won't be in place initially.  Dick, please let me know how to contact you on Wed and at what times.  Thank you all.  Charles 713-853-0348","Andy.

2022-04-22 00:38:13+00:00,true,3,"  NERC's Control Area Criteria Task Force (CACTF) paper on the Reliability Model ""unbundles"" definitionally the functions of a control area.  Today's control area is required under NERC policy to meet many reliability requirements for short-term, daily and real-time operations.   NERC CACTF identified 4 major areas of function:  1) Security Authority  Performs short term security analysis for interchange schedules (between control areas) Administers curtailment procedures (NERC TLR)  2) Interchange Authority Responsible for maintaining a net of interchange schedules that balance at control area interfaces in real-time  3) Balancing Authority Provides real-time dispatch to match energy demand and supply Maintains performance measures such as frequency, and voltage requirements Maintains accounting balance sheets for inadvertent energy between control areas  4) Transmission Service Provider Offers transmission access through a tariff Calculates ATC/TTC and other transfer capability amounts Responsible for accounting line losses  5) Market Participants Includes Purchasing Selling Entities, Generators, and Load Serving Entities  It is important to remember that the NERC CACTF Relibility Model describes only FUNCTIONs and does not attempt to restructure a vertically integrated control area that may perform any and all of these functions.  The CACTF developed these concepts and explored how to provide comparability and eliminate competitive advantages of control areas.  This entailed specifiying indpendence requirements on certain functions.  Unfortunately, in order to eliminate the competitive advantages, transmission companies (particularly SERC members and small municipalities) successfully argued that NERC lacked the authority to order or mandate restructuring of organizations to accomodate the CACTF model and its independence requirements.    It is Enron's position at NERC that the Security Authority, Transmission Service Provider, and the Balancing Authoirity must be divorced of the market participants - i.e. - ""independence"".  Today, Enron and other entities have obtained certain control area advantages through formation of control areas to specifically obtain the abilities provided under the Interchange Authority.  It was the attempt of the CACTF to unbundle the control area such that all market participants had comparable access to the Interchange Authority advantages.  The Grid South problem: Their current proposal is to have the RTO perform the Interchange Authority function.  For tags (PTP service) that are submitted that utilize the Grid South tariff, GridSouth will approve and clear those tags for scheduling.  However, the 3 existing control areas would continue to perform the control area functions for its own transactions and native load schedules (inadvertent accounting, balancing, and performance criteria CPS, remains in the control areas).  In other words, the proposal only delegates the bare minimum of control area functions to the GridSouth operator, those needed to administer the tariff for PTP service customers.  Except for the Secuirty Authority functions which will be performed by GridSouth, the operational advantages of control areas, will remain at the transmission company level.   FERC must mandate the independence requirements and  force GridSouth members to restructure to remove all competitive advantages.

2022-04-22 04:21:02+00:00,true,3,"  Ok,Y'all, Texas has given all those complainers plenty of time to get used to the results. After seeing the whiners along the inauguration route, We Texicans have decided that we might just take matters into our own hands. Here is a solution:  #1: Let Al Gore become President of the United States (all 49 states).  #2: George W. Bush becomes the President of the Republic of Texas.  So what does Texas have to do to survive as a Republic?  NASA in Houston, Texas (we will control the space industry).  We refine over 85% of the gasoline in the United States  Defense Industry (we have over 65% of it). The term ""Don't mess with Texas,"" will take on a whole new meaning.  Oil - we can supply all the oil that the Republic of ! Texas will need for the next 300 years. Yankee states? Sorry about that.  Natural Gas - Again we have all we need and it's too bad about those northern states. Al Gore will figure a way to keep them warm....  Computer Industry - we currently lead the nation in producing computer chips and communications: Small places like Texas Instruments, Dell Computer, EDS, Raytheon, National Semiconductor, Motorola, Intel, AMD, Atmel, Applied Materials, Ball Semiconductor, Dallas Semiconductor, Delphi, Nortel, Alcatel, Etc,Etc.  The list goes on and on.  Health Centers - We have the largest research centers for Cancer research, the best burn centers and the top trauma units in the world, and other large health planning centers.   We have enough colleges to keep us going: UT, Texas A&M, Rice, SMU, University of Houston, Baylor, UNT, Texas Women's University,<B! Retc. Ivy grows better in the south anyway.  We h! ave a ready supply of workers (just open the border when we need some more).  We have control of the paper industry, toilet paper, plastics, insurance, etc.  In case of a foreign invasion; we have the Texas National Guard and the Texas Air National Guard. We don't have an army but since everybody down here has at least six rifles and a pile of ammunition, we can raise an army in 24 hours if we need it. If the situation really gets bad, we can always call Department of Public Safety and ask them to send over a couple Texas Rangers. As a last resort we can always raise an army of Mexicans.  We are totally self sufficient in beef, poultry, hogs and vegetable produce and everybody down here knows how to cook them so that they taste good.  Don't need any food.  This just names a few of the items that will keep the Republic of Texas in good shape. There isn't a thing out there that we need a! nd don't have.  Now to the rest of the United States under President Gore: Since you won't have the refineries to get gas for your cars, only President Gore will be able to drive around in his 9 mile per gallon SUV. The rest of the United States will have to walk or ride bikes.  You won't have any TV as the space center in Houston will cut off your communications. You won't have any natural gas to heat your homes but since Mr. Gore has predicted global warming, you will not need the gas.  Just a few notes on REAL election results:  Total Counties won by Bush: 2,434 Total Counties won by Gore: 677  Population of counties won by Bush: 143 million. Population of counties won by Gore: 127 million  Square miles of country won by Bush: 2,427,000 Square miles of country won by Gore: 580,000  States won by Bush: 29 States won by Gore: 19  And an even more remarkable finding....  Avera! ge Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Bush:<BR!0.1 Average Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Gore: 13.2  Researchers found one more interesting fact that might help explain these disparate murder rates. Gun ownership in the counties won by Mr. Bush is much higher than in the counties won by Mr. Gore.

Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can find the perfect present yet again!  6.) If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.  7.) Sometimes, we're not thinking about you. Live with it. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as navel lint, or the shotgun formation.  8.) Sunday = Sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.  9.) Shopping is not a sport, and no, we're never going to think of it that way.  10.) When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.  Really.  11.) You have enough clothes. You have too many shoes.  12.) Crying is blackmail.  13.) Ask for what you want. Let's be clear on this one: Subtle hints don't work. Strong hints don't work. Really obvious hints don't work. Just say it!  14.) No, we don't know what day it is. We never will. Mark Anniversaries on the calendar.  15.) Peeing standing up is more difficult. We're bound to miss sometimes.  16.) Most guys own three pairs of shoes. What makes you think we'd be any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?  17.) Yes, and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.  18.) Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do.  19.) Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.  20.) A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.  21.) Foreign films are best left to foreigners. (Unless it's Bruce Lee or some war flick where it doesn't really matter what they're saying anyway.  22.) Check your oil.  23.) It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz together.  24.) No, it doesn't matter which quiz.  25.) Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All comments become null and void after 7 days.  26.) If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.  27.) Let us ogle. We're going to look anyway; it's genetic.  28.) You can either tell us to do something OR tell us how to do something, but not both.  29.) Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.  30.) If it itches, it will be scratched.  31.) Beer is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.  32.) If we ask what's wrong and you say ""nothing,"" we will act like nothing's wrong.  33.) We know you're lying, but it's just not worth the hassle.

But, I do not think that the trend has changed.  In my humble opinion, I think that the number was probably an adjustment of over statements of inventory over the past 8 weeks. I do not believe that the number should have any baring on the numbers going forward.  I still expect us to trend down, but it will probably take an extra week to recover from this move.

Dick will attend the upcoming WSCC EPITF meeting (not sure of date, but think in the next two weeks).  My recommendation is that Steve Walton attend with Dick and become the lead.  We may not get a voting seat after Dick leaves, but we should try and cover.  Ray Alvarez should attend the WSCC Board Meeting on Aug 27 with Dick to pick up these responsibilities.  Charles Yeung should pick up coverage for the FlowBased discussions.  Dick will not attend the next meeting in Chicago that takes place on Aug 30.    Andy Rodriguez should pick up the Security Coordinator Subcommitte discussions that take place Sept 25 - 27.  Dick will not attend.  I think that Charles, Ray, Dick and I should attend the NERC Stakeholders Mtg on Oct 15 - 16.  Finally, Dave Perrino should go with Dick to the next WSCC OCTPG meeting.

Thank you. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- On  preliminary review of the Draft Proposal,  I wonder whether, if adopted by the Chargeback Complainants and the Participants Committee, it should be submitted to the Commission in the Chargeback Docket, not in Judge Birchman's proceeding under the July 25 Order.  That order limits Judge Birchman to making findings of fact and certifying the record on ""(1) the mitigated price in each hour of the refund period; (2) the amount of refunds owed by each supplier according to the prescribed methodology; and (3) the amount currently owed to each supplier (with separate quantities due from each entity by the ISO, the investor owned utilities, and the State of California."" (Mimeo at 42).  If the settlement were submitted in the Chargeback docket, the Commission could refer it to Birchman with appropriate instructions as to how he should treat it when he certifies the record and his findings.  Or FERC could hold the settlement until after Birchman's report.  This brings up timing questions.  The July 25 Order directed the ALJ to certify the record and findings 45 days after receiving the CAISO's hour-by-hour reconstruction of mitigated prices between October 2, 2000 and June 20 2001.  Under Judge Birchman's Order of August 14 establishing a trial schedule (attached), final ISO data won't be submitted until September 17, which pushes the certification and finding date to November 2.   We need to think about how the schedule shown in the attached order impacts the timing and method of bringing the settlement before FERC, assuming that the proposal's  wording and substance are accepted by all Chargeback Complainants and the Official Committee.

2022-04-22 14:15:46+00:00,true,4,"  MEMORANDUM  TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee        Power Marketers Working Group        Legislative Affairs Committee  FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair             Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair             Scott Weiner, Legislative Affairs Committee Chair             Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy             Donn Salvosa, Manager of Government Affairs  DATE: August 16, 2001  RE: Reliability Legislation  We are providing you with this memo to provide some information and perspective on the important issues relating to federal legislation in advance of our August 20th joint Regulatory Affairs and Legislative Affairs meeting on reliability legislation.  Reliability Legislation  S. 2071  S. 2071, sponsored by Sen. Slade Gorton (R-WA), was approved by the Senate in the last Congress.  The House of Representatives did not act on the bill.  S. 2071 represents the only consensus bill to be approved by either chamber.  This legislation would establish a national electric reliability organization (ERO) with the authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability standards.  FERC would have primary jurisdiction over:  ? the electric reliability organization (ERO);  ? all Affiliated Regional Reliability Entities (entities to which authority would   be delegated to enforce compliance with reliability standards);  ? all system operators; and  ? all users of the bulk-power system.  The bill prescribes procedural guidelines for FERC approval of applications competing for status as the ERO and ERO standards. It would also require all users of the transmission system to comply with such standards.  What causes us some concern are a number of provisions in the legislation that would delegate authority to different entities.  The bill would:  ? Allow the ERO, subject to FERC approval, to delegate authority to a   requesting regional entity to implement and enforce compliance with   standards.  ? Include a broad savings clause which preserves state authority to ""ensure   the safety, adequacy and reliability of electric service within each state.""  ? Not ensure that the boundaries of ARREs and RTOs are the same,   although it would instruct ARREs to cooperate with RTOs to ensure   enforcement of standards.  A similar bill - H.R. 2602 - was introduced in the House last session by Rep. Albert Wynn (D-MD). No action was taken on this bill.  The same language is included in the comprehensive energy bill introduced by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM).  Other Developments  Last year, in response to failed attempts by the Congress to pass comprehensive electricity legislation, a number of groups headed by NERC, sent a letter to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-IL), calling for the passage of stand alone reliability legislation.  The letter is attached.  A number of groups, including public power groups, the California ISO, Edison Electric Institute, NARUC and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association all signed the letter.  EPSA was strongly pressured to sign the letter to add more weight and credibility to the effort.  However, we did not sign the letter.  While we stated that we did not oppose the letter, EPSA's position at the time was the advocacy for comprehensive federal legislation.  Last month, a number of groups with interests in reliability legislation met in Washington in an attempt to forge an agreement on legislation that can be supported by industry stakeholders.  Efforts were made to shorten the existing legislation similar to the bill introduced by Rep. Albert Wynn without changing the intent of provisions in the language.  In addition to EPSA, other groups in attendance included NARUC, the Pennsylvania PUC, Entergy, PJM , Public Power Groups, Consumer Groups, ELCON, Mirant and Enron.  The meeting produced a realization among the participants on the wide difference of opinions on how best to proceed.  The state PUCs lobbied for a continued state role in reliability language.  Entergy supported the original language contained in the Bingaman bill.  Still, a number of other groups favored the shorter PJM version.  PJM Proposal  PJM recently circulated condensed reliability language.  The 4-page bill would give enforcement authority to FERC.  If you would like a copy faxed to you, please contact Michael Reddy (mreddy@epsa.org) at EPSA.  Additionally, FERC would establish reliability standards and will maintain primary jurisdiction.  FERC would designate a national reliability entity composed of a number of regional entities for the purpose of developing reliability standards for the transmission system.  Some concerns over the PJM language include:  ? Formation of regional entities that would be a ""bottoms up"" organization.   These entities would have no regard to how they conform with RTOs.  ? Reliability standards would be developed as voluntary consensus   standards  ? The regions and the national entity would be on equal ground.  Revised NERC language  Just last Thursday NERC convened another meeting for the purposes of attempting to shorten the original NERC language.  Working off of the language found in the Wynn bill, the new language was shortened to 16 pages.  The red-lined version is attached.  Among the noteworthy changes:  ? p. 6, applications for approval to become the ERO, strikes language to   specify funding mechanisms and requirements.  ? p. 13, changes in filings of funding and funding procedures, language   deleted on specifics on changes to funding.  ? p. 21, additional language added to state that neither the ERO nor FERC   will have the authority to order construction of additional generation or   transmission if it determines a need.  ? p. 22, language on coordination with RTOs deleted.  Status and Prospects of Legislation  The Republican House and the leadership of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Rep. W.J. ""Billy"" Tauzin (R-LA) and Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality Chairman Joe Barton (R-TX) has maintained the position that electricity should be addressed in a comprehensive fashion.  This is a continuation of the position held by Former House Commerce Chairman Tom Bliley (R-VA).   Staff for Chairman Tauzin are in the process of developing electricity provisions during the August recess.  It is likely that one of the titles will be on reliability.  The Senate, with its recent switch in control, remains uncertain on the overall view of stand alone reliability legislation.  In its present version, Senate Energy Chairman Bingaman's bill contains the same reliability provisions found in the Wynn bill.  Chairman Bingaman also plans to markup legislation in the Fall.  Regulatory/NERC/GISB Developments  While the timing and details of reliability legislation remain uncertain, NERC has continued its effort to transition to NAERO.  When first envisioned several years ago, the legislative objective was to establish NAERO as a self-regulatory organization with authority to enforce mandatory reliability standards.  Legislative delays, however, led the NERC Board to take unilateral steps to advance the transition, beginning with its governance structure.  Last February, the 38 member board was replaced by a new board of ten independent board members.  Members of the former board then were reconstituted as the new Stakeholder Committee with an advisory role, in addition to authority to participate in funding, board member changes and a few other general matters.  Also, the board implemented a compliance program based upon contracts to be executed by the Regional Reliability Councils.  Funding for NERC, presently administered by the regions, remains an extremely problematic, open question, as is the continued dominance of transmission providers in the current NERC Standing Committee voting structure.  The GISB proposal to include a wholesale electric quadrant in the new Energy Industry Standards Board (EISB) has provided an alternative that didn't exist at the time the NAERO concept, and related legislative effort, began.  The EISB model, which would combine the development of gas and electric retail and wholesale standards, initially viewed as a remote prospect when it was floated in early 2000, has gained substantial momentum.  During FERC's June 19th technical conference on Function 8 and interregional coordination, the Commissioners compared the circumstances in the gas industry that led to the formation of GISB with those of the electric industry today.  In separate letters to GISB Executive Director Rae McQuade dated August 13th, Commissioners Massey, Wood and Brownell observed the need to develop uniform rules and standards and expressed enthusiastic support for a new EISB to do it.  Those letters were distributed during an industry conference hosted by the Department of Energy (DOE) on August 14 - 15th, further contributing to the credibility of the EISB proposal.  Meanwhile, the pressure that the EISB proposal is generating clearly appears to have become part of the overall context for NERC's reform effort, as well as the reliability legislation.  A task force set up by the NERC Stakeholder Committee is reviewing how to make the three Standing Committees more ""open and inclusive,"" including possible recommendations to change the voting structure from the current 50/50 (transmission provider/transmission customer) to a sector approach.  The NERC board may receive those recommendations, and other possible NERC reforms, including a new Organization Standards Process, when it meets in October.  The effort to launch an EISB is expected to come to a head when the GISB board meets on September 19th.  There are indications that the board will approve going forward with the proposal.  Such action would considerably raise the stakes for the NERC board, and present challenging issues regarding how to set up the voting sectors within the wholesale electric quadrant.  Additionally, the industry will need to consider how to more precisely define the types of standards the new organization would develop.  The emergence of a new EISB, if it occurs, could potentially diverge from legislation that presumes that NERC/NAERO will be the only standard setting organization.  Granting a new NAERO authority over ""reliability"" will beg serious questions regarding its scope of activities, and create the specter of multiple organizations that many hope to avoid.   - Hastert Letter Final 091200 - Attachments_1.doc   - Hastert Letter Final 0912002_1.doc   - Wynn Bill with Red Line Changes - 080901_1.DOC ","MEMORANDUM TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee Power Marketers Working Group Legislative Affairs Committee FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair Scott Weiner, Legislative Affairs Committee Chair Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy Don"

We will be circulating Richard's draft testimony on economic issues later this afternoon for TFG review.  Also, please be advised that the Steering Committee suggests that Ripple Claim testimony that TFG members may file individually contain an aggregate gross refund number, and refer to the number of sellers who would be responsible for the refunds.  To keep peace in the family, the Steering Committee recommends that individual sellers with refund responsibility NOT be named.  Since this testimony will not be admitted into evidence and will not be subject to cross, but will be placed in the record as an offer of proof, the Steering Committee believes that work papers need not be supplied.  So the identities of the first wave Ripple Claim respondents  need not be revealed under this approach.

Salvosa, Manager of Government Affairs  DATE: August 31, 2001  RE: August 20th Joint Legislative/Regulatory Affairs Meeting       on Reliability Legislation       -Summary of EPSA Position       -Exploration of Future Initiatives  The August 20th Meeting  On August 20th, the EPSA's Legislative and Regulatory Affairs Committees met to review and discuss existing proposals on reliability legislation.  Dave Nevius of NERC explained the current draft of the so-called stakeholder ""consensus"" bill, and Bobby Lamb presented the competing proposal being advanced by PJM.  After these presentations, Nevius and Lamb responded to numerous questions.  Thereafter, EPSA members discussed the relative merits of the two proposals, concluding with a straw poll indicating support for exploring an alternative to NERC's bill.  Specifically, EPSA members expressed general dissatisfaction with the new, ""streamlined"" version of the NERC bill.  Additionally, serious doubts exist regarding the possibility of revising the language in the NERC bill in any way that would make it acceptable.  General observations about the fundamental aspects of the NERC bill indicated that people are not comfortable shifting authority away form FERC to an overly complex, prescriptive organization with uncertain delegations of enforcement authority to regional entities (apparently successors to existing Regional Reliability Councils).  Regarding alternatives, there was consensus that the general approach contained in the PJM proposal, subject to additional work to resolve several weaknesses, could become an acceptable vehicle for addressing reliability issues.  While EPSA members clearly are ""leaning toward"" the PJM  bill, the proposals raises serious questions concerning: (1) the states' role regarding ""adequacy"" and their right to adopt ""more stringent"" standards based upon ""compelling need,"" even if inconsistent with national standards; and (2) limited provision for coordination with Canada and Mexico.  The PJM Proposal  PJM's proposal contains a number of positive aspects, including:  ?Its simplicity: it is only 5 pages long.  Members and staff on Capitol Hill have repeatedly pleaded for a shorter version of reliability legislation.  The PJM proposal is at least 10 pages shorter than the NERC bill.  ?FERC and the RTOs would have primary jurisdiction over development and enforcement of reliability standards.  The NERC language gives substantial deference to the ERO (in all likelihood, NERC, reformed in ways that are not yet clear or certain) and accompanying ARREs (successors to the Regional Reliability Councils).  ?EISB - With the expected approval of the formation of EISB at the upcoming meeting of the GISB Board on September 19th, coupled with strong support from FERC Commissioners Wood, Brownell and Massey, the PJM proposal allows an opportunity to incorporate EISB.  The NERC bill is unclear how an EISB would be accommodated, if at all. Some issues raising concern which need to be addressed, include:  ?State role - the language contains a savings provision which would defer to each state to enforce standards within their boundaries.  Only through applications from affected parties can FERC review state actions and may delay such state action, although it does not specifically state that it can prevent it.  ?International issues - specifically interfaces with Canada and Mexico.  The language expresses the need to establish ""harmonious"" reliability standards with each country throughout the North American region.  While simply instructing FERC to do so, PJM's proposal may need to more clearly explain how to this would be accomplished.  ?Variances - The NERC language presently allows for interconnection wide variances.  The WSCC favors this approach and the Senate Energy Committee, with the bulk of its membership from the west region, may have something to say about the lack of ability for a region to request a variance.  Whether or not a compromise can be formulated is something we will need to explore.  Next Steps  The game plan is to open a dialogue with proponents of the PJM bill in order to discuss how best to improve the language to remove potential obstacles to it's attracting wider support.  While this memo summarizes several key issues, there may be others which will need to be discussed.

2022-04-22 04:54:17+00:00,true,4,"  Here are some of the ERCOT explanations for operations that past few days.  These come from Sam Jones, the COO of ERCOT.  Also, if we have not started to do so, we need to catalogue, irregularities that we see or perceive in the market.  Especially, in the time that we are communicating with ERCOT and the Commission, specific well documented examples are compelling and assist us as we further our advocacy  Pre Day One-Scheduling/Bidding.  In the bidding of ancillary services at least two QSEs (Dynegy and TXU), did not bid into the market.  The price cleared however, there was an insufficiency was declared and the market was re-opened and cleared at 80% by rule.  Day One Operations.  The ERCOT main server failed and market participants were asked to schedule via the OASIS and the portal when it became operational.  Market participants were asked to schedule via the OASIS and Portal/API.  ERCOT cancelled certificates that allowed them to look at QSE data and systems, in doing so they also cancelled the certificates that allowed internal systems to communicate.  Balancing Energy Problems.  There have been continued problems with the balancing energy and the first issue is the way it is being calculated.  When calculating balancing energy requirements, the operator looks at the load forecast and the QSE schedules and an initial amount is determined.  Then the system will look at the resource plans which have not been updated frequently and then will override the previous calculation for balancing energy.  The reason the system looks at the resource plan is to control/relieve local congestion.  The problem is that settlements are based on the schedule and not the resource plan and ERCOT has not had the ability to override the system to account for the error in the resource plan.  One, ERCOT has determined a way to override the system to account for the inaccurate resource plans.  Two, ERCOT has discussed with ESCA changes to the system so that the system will look as SCADA data rather than the resource plan for clearing local congestion.  Part Two.  Recently there have been discrepancies on the price awarded for B/E in the market and the amount credited to the settlement statement.  Also, deployment was based incorrectly on unit specific instructions that were supposed to be zonal or ERCOT wide.  The incorrect coding was located and corrected.  Subject to what happens today, the systems seems to be operating correctly.","The following are some of the ERCOT explanations for operations that occurred in the past few days.

2022-04-22 17:46:48+00:00,true,4,"  Per your request, here is the status of two issues we are addressing which are currently on the radar screen at FERC.  Reporting Requirements for Sales to California  On July 25, 2001, FERC issued an Order imposing reporting requirements on natural gas sales to California.  The order affects transporters and LDCs as well as sellers.  FERC has provided templates which parties must use in compiling the reports, which are due thirty days after the end of the month.  Sellers are required to report all their sales that are made either at the California border or within the state on a daily basis.  They must also report separately the transportation component and the gas commodity component of the price for each sales contract.  In essence, the FERC requirement assumes that sellers can track individual packages of gas from the wellhead to the point of sale.  ENA/EES are filing a request for rehearing of the Order, arguing:  1. That it is an error to formalize the reporting requirements.  They should only be in place on an ad hoc basis to allow FERC to collect and review data for the periods of time that an actual situation deserving of analysis exists.  The formalized and generally applicable requirements adopted go far beyond the scope of FERC's authority. 2. That FERC must properly assess the time and work burden on the companies subject to the requirements.  Neither ENA nor EES manage their business in a way that would allow them to extract the required information without making arbitrary, after-the-fact determinations of which purchases were made for which customers, and this would involve significant manual intervention.  The Gas Operations group, who have been evaluating our systems to determine how we could comply, believe that it may be necessary to assign at least one person full-time to the task of compiling the data.  Therefore, reporting entities should not be required to supply ""manufactured data"" simply to complete the forms. 3. That FERC should extend the deadline for reporting to 45 days from the end of the reporting month.  The personnel in gas accounting who will have to extract the data are busiest at the first of the month.  Extending the deadline to mid-month would make compliance easier and more accurate.  The first two arguments are generally the same ones we made when we filed comments in the original NOPR.    Marketing Affiliate NOPR  It is almost certain that FERC will issue a NOPR sometime in September to address possible changes in the marketing affiliate rule.  Some issues that we expect to be addressed include expanding the definition of marketing affiliates to include electric generators and some further tightening of the regulations in response to the ""funny money"" issue that certain parties keep bringing up.    We have gotten informal feedback that certain staff persons at FERC are questioning why they have not been hearing from marketing affiliates while the pipelines and their association have been coming in arguing against any changes to the rule.  Therefore, we have tentatively scheduled a meeting next week, while we are in D.C. for a technical conference on the El Paso Reallocation issues, to meet with selected staff personnel to discuss the reasons we do not see any need for changes, although we are willing to accept a designation of affiliates engaged in electric generation development as marketing affiliates.  This position should not disadvantage us in any way, since we fall under the designation anyway because of our organizational structure.  We are also developing data on our firm contracts with the Enron pipelines in anticipation of responding to the NOPR.

2022-04-22 12:20:01+00:00,true,4,"  Thanks for the feedback.    Your model now assumes a modification to the Distribution tariff to include a new rate element.  That may get around the Settlement (although OCA in PA will think that now D is going up and there is no offset in the G rate so consumers are getting screwed because they won't switch).    Also, can the PaPUC implement this charge and direct the EDCs to transfer the funds to third-party generators?  Seems like that would require legislative changes.    I like the idea that there should be fixed charge for ICAP - one way to get that number would be to go back to the EDC stranded cost cases and look at their filed testimony - remember if they are earning more from the market than that $ amount, they are overearning on their stranded costs.

2022-04-22 10:24:16+00:00,true,4,"   I wanted to summarize the conclusions from our meeting on Wednesday, August 8th.  Please let me know if I have misrepresented anything.    Below is a description of four proposals which may help resolve issues associated with PX credits or mitigate Enron's exposure to PX credits.  Steve Swain has the responsibility for evaluating each proposal, and his goal is to have recommendations for EWS/EES management on August 14th.    Current Issues: 1)  The methodology for calculating PX credits after January 18 is undetermined (SCE and PG&E have implemented different methodologies) 2)  Applicability of the 1 cent surcharge to direct access customers (PG&E is passing thru to DA customers, SCE is not) 3)  Impact to Enron if  FERC implements  retroactive changes to the CAL PX clearing prices from Oct 2, 2000 thru January 18th which result in revised PX credits  4)  Recoupment of outstanding PX credits against future payments for T&D 5)  Uncertainty surrounding future tariffs (CTC or other pass through charges), making it difficult to hedge price risk in forward positions 6)  Large uncollected receivables from both PG&E and SCE   The four proposals are as follows:  SCE Recommended Approach   This approach assumes no PX (or PE) credit effective from January 18, 2001 forward.  Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the  gross PX receivable (as billed by each utility)  which would  be reversed.   This approach will ensure that only charges for T&D (no  generation/commodity costs, CTC charges, or surcharges for CDWR, including the 1 cent)  will be applicable to Direct Access customers.     Enron would request the following:  1) Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to EES or EEMC  2) SCE will support our historical PX  credit receivable as an ""allowable claim"" at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if possible.    3) PG&E will support Enron's recoupment argument   4) Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit Balances on utility bills and agree to a netting arrangement at the utility parent  level.   5) Both utilities agree to not adjust the historical PX credits, if/when an adjustment of historical PX clearing prices is mandated by FERC    Other consideration:  Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concern re CTC or other surcharge amounts.     PG&E Recommended Approach  This approach assumes the PX calculation methodology effective January 18, 2001 would include an ""avoided cost""  component.  This avoided cost    component would include, owned generation, QF purchases, actual CDWR purchases for the utility, bilateral purchase contracts, and ISO purchases.   This resulting ""avoided cost"" would be used in lieu of the PX clearing price in the old PX formula through March, 2002.    If the actual CDWR purchase  costs are not included, then the surcharge (along with the embedded gen costs)  should be included in the calculation.      Enron would request the following:  Same as above   Other Consideration:  Enron  would continue to be exposed to ""price"" risk attributable to the actions of the utility at a minimum through March, 2002.  This would hamper  Enron's ability  to hedge the positions in the retail portfolio.   Hybrid Approach  This approach assumes that the PG&E approach is applicable from January 18, 2001 through September 1, 2001 and that the SCE approach is  applicable from September 1st forward.   This approach might be necessary as a compromise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposal.    Enron would request the following:  Same as SCE and PG&E approach   Other considerations:  Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concern re CTC or other surcharge amounts.     Enron Model   This approach assumes we continue to support a market based (NP15 and SP15) calculation methodology for the PX credit.      Enron would request the following:  It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from either PG&E and SCE.   The consensus from legal, regulatory, and EWS commercial is  the probability of getting this approach approved is low.   However, understanding this amount, at a minimum, can be used to help defend the ""value"" Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utilities and CPUC.   Other considerations:  This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge ""price"" risk, but this is somewhat offset with  incremental credit exposure associated with the  actual collection of the PX credit.   Again, please let me know if this does not clearly represent what we concluded in Wednesday's meeting.  Thanks, Wanda Curry ","I wanted to summarize the conclusions from our meeting on Wednesday, August 8th. Please let me know if I have misrepresented anything.

2022-04-22 13:31:04+00:00,true,4,"  At yesterday's FERC-faciliated meeting, stakeholders were successful in voicing concerns regarding constitution of an Advisory Board that would report to a non-independent entity, i.e. Bridgeco.  As a result, Alliance floated a proposal to constitute an interim independent board which stakeholders responded to, demanding signficant changes including an expanded scope of authority for that board.  Details of the discussions are included in the attached Word document.    On the matter of affilate representation on the Advisory Committee, Alliance agreed that the corporate entity must decide which segment it wishes to be represented in, and that the corporate entity could be represented via its affiliates in only one sector.    As the discussions were lengthy and mult-focused, I have captured most of the salient points in the attached document.  A meeting is scheduled for August 21st at 10am in Cincinnati, at which time the Alliance will present its interim independent board proposal incorporating to the extent it can stakeholders' concerns.  Where those concerns (identified in the attachment) cannot be incorporated, the Alliance promises to explain the reasons why.  Alliance hopes to circulate its revised proposal by close of business on the 20th, but if not will bring a written revised proposal to the meeting in Cincinnati.  I will attend the meeting if you wish.  The self-designation process initiated on the Alliance website to begin to constitute the Advisory Committee is being suspended, in view of the discussions yesterday.  The FERC facilitators are putting language to that effect together which Alliance intends to post on its website.

""There is evidence tha= t DWR is attempting to overcharge electric customers in PG&E's service area=  by over $1.4 billion in 2001 and 2002 alone, but DWR is refusing to hold a=  hearing on whether its costs are reasonable and supportable,"" said Roger P= eters, Pacific Gas and Electric Company's senior vice president and general=  counsel. ""DWR should not be given a blank check to pay for its high-priced=  power contracts. The public needs to be able to review DWR's contracts and=  hold them accountable for the billions of dollars they are spending.""  Bas= ed on limited information provided by DWR, PG&E's analysis indicates that D= WR has padded its revenue requirement for 2001-2002 by more than $3 billion=  due to overestimating the cost for spot power purchases and natural gas. A= s a result, PG&E's customers would overpay over $1.4 billion in the next tw= o years alone.  DWR determined that its revenue requirement was just and re= asonable without providing any type of prior notice and without conducting = a full and complete public review of its costs or revenue requirement.  Und= er the California Administrative Procedure Act, Water Code, Public Utilitie= s Code, and the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions,=  DWR must hold a hearing to allow utility customers, consumer groups and al= l other interested parties an opportunity to comment on the justness and re= asonableness of their revenue demands. DWR's determination of its revenue r= equirement must then be based on those comments and the overall evidence in=  the record. Ultimately at stake are $68 billion of costs to utility custom= ers over the next ten years under DWR contracts which have never been revie= wed in a public hearing. This works out to an average of $6,800 for each of=  the 10 million electric customers within the service areas of PG&E, Edison=  and SDG&E. Pacific Gas and Electric Company, along with consumer groups an= d other utility companies, has urged that DWR's revenue requirement receive=  the appropriate level of public comment and review prior to adoption and i= nclusion in rates. DWR has repeatedly refused the requests for additional i= nformation and public hearings, saying it is exempt from any review by the = public or the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) regarding the b= asis or reasonableness of its request or costs.  The petition filed today r= equests the court to order DWR to withdraw its determination that its reven= ue requirement is just and reasonable until it complies with federal and st= ate laws and holds a public hearing to determine if their power costs are ""= just and reasonable.""

2022-04-22 16:41:07+00:00,true,4,"  To All,  Attached is a clean version of the comments to be filed with FERC today (8/20) relating to the WSCC-wide price mitigation.    Highlights:  EPMI requests that the caps be removed, using arguments that caps are not beneficial to development of a robust market in the west. If - a cap is necessary we suggest an alternative where the highest cost unit in the entire west set the price. Price certainty - we explain how the market needs price certainty and that the price cap with the potential for changing hourly is detrimental to a functioning energy market We point out the lack of independence of the CAISO and their board.  The fact that the ISO operates with the vested interest of CA and not the entire west. Marketer cost recovery - we describe the current problem where marketers are excluded from ""above-the-cap"" bidding and justification.   FYI, our comments line-up closely with those being filed by PGE and other PNW entities, so the Commission will be getting a consistent message from many WSCC entities - remove the cap.  I have briefed Tim on the content of the filing and Ray has spoken to Kim Curry of Bracewell/Patterson and approved this be filed on our behalf today 8/20.

2022-04-22 08:33:44+00:00,true,4,"  Folks:  We're getting down to the wire.  The Legislature has failed to come up with a solution.  The Treasuer (Angelides) has been marketing the bond issuance.  The key component of his sales pitch to investors is his guarantee that the PUC will suspend DA at its August 23rd meeting, period.  Loretta's in a box with few options other than suspension.    Attached is a proposal that Sue and I pulled together yesterday (all defects, errors, lapses of judgment, etc., included in the proposal are mine, not Sue's).  It's got two options:  Option A Cap DA at the net short position for the next 12 months on a first-come-first-serve basis.  ""New"" DA customers would pay fixed charges for 1) utility past debt and 2) the bonds to cover DWR purchases from Jan to present.  ""New"" DA customers would be exempt from DWR long-term charges, however.  ""Old"" DA customers would be exempt from everything.  Absent legislation addressing DA, PUC would revisit in 12 months.  Option B No cap on DA eligibility.  However, ""New"" DA customers would pay fixed charges for 1) utility past debt, 2) the bonds to cover DWR purchases from Jan to present, and 3) above-market costs of DWR contracts. ""Old"" DA customers would be exempt from everything.  Absent legislation addressing DA, PUC would revisit in 12 months.  Clearly, these are not ""first best"" DA constructs.  But the situation we face is arguably binary----DA suspended altogether, or a significantly compromised DA market, but a market, nonetheless.  Tomorrow is a meeting of the Direct Access Coaltion, where Sue and I intend to present the options and attempt to get ""everyone"" on board.  If successful, we would file the proposal (as a very large coaltion) with the PUC on Friday, accompanied by a noisy press release.  Please review and determine if there are defects in the options that would prevent us from going forward.  We'd like to discuss further on today's 1:30 (CDT) California call.

2022-04-22 20:23:53+00:00,true,4,"  Jamie --  Thank you for keeping me in the loop on your activities.  While I am always supportive of more public statements pushing competition, neither I nor Enron can sign on to the letter.    First, I am concerned that having Enron sign on will distract from your messages.  Enron is a ""hot button"" in DC and will change the proper focus.  In addition, I would argue that the recommendation for a national commission is out of place with the current timing of FERC and Congressional action -- which is imminent -- while a commission would delay action on the Hill and at FERC, thus supporting the forces against competition.  Let's not study this too much - we know what to do.  Move away from the commission.  Also, I'm not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that promote competition supports our efforts.  Making GA pay for PA is a distraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill.  Finally, I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies will only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry.

The data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for, and for the most part, Enron's internal systems did not track the information in the format requested.  Since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money, it was imperative that (1) the data be pulled together, even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible; (2) the data be as accurate as possible, and; (3) it be done in a very short period of time.  The amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive.  Utilizing Cara's comprehensive, and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems, we were able to accomplish this task.  There were many instances where we hit a ""brick wall"".  Specifically, it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset, although it was imperative we do so.  Cara was instrumental in bridging this gap.  As a result of her efforts, we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in DC, and subsequently for our FERC filing.

Inventory of commonly used Universes and their data structure (4 hours)  2.  Description of the canned reports that currently exist and how they are being used.  (2 hours)  3.  Q&A and assistance in developing reports (2 hours).

The biggest ""contributor"" of this hit is the restructured Modesto deal # 520328.3, which alone caused -$130K in Other Changes (a.k.a. 2nd Order in financial terms).  I believe what happened is that Matt re-marked the daily volatility curves down by a significant magnitude on 8/13/01 (* please see curve managers for the change).  Usually when volatilities changed drastically they would disrupt financial evaluation models and more likely to cause a change in deal value by factors which cannot be explained (i.e. Second Order).  This doesn't necessarily mean that the evaluation is incorrect but just that there will be some value change for which the models cannot pinpoint the reasons.  Anyway, for this basis option deal you lost $94K on 8/13, and this -$94K can be broken down into Curve Shift (-$19K), Gamma ($1.5K), Vega (70K), Theta (-16K), and Second Order/Other Changes (-$130K).    I looked at the curve change and interest rate change between 8/10 and 8/13 and they are relatively insignificant, but the drastic volatility mark down makes me feel that your losing money in this deal is somewhat consistent w/ what we should expect.    I am still working with IT to see if we can nail this down to give you a more specific explanation.  In the mean time, if you have any thoughts or concerns, please feel free to let me know.

The text is a slightly modified version of what Powerex filed at the July 9 hearing in the settlement conferences before Judge Wagner.

Also, please be advised that the Steering Committee suggests that Ripple Claim testimony that TFG members may file individually contain an aggregate gross refund number, and refer to the number of sellers who would be responsible for the refunds.  To keep peace in the family, the Steering Committee recommends that individual sellers with refund responsibility NOT be named.  Since this testimony will not be admitted into evidence and will not be subject to cross, but will be placed in the record as an offer of proof, the Steering Committee believes that work papers need not be supplied.

He met with the Governor's folks and spoke to Loretta Lynch last week to discuss undercollection strategies, the MOU, and direct access.  He is not optimistic that any of these issues will be resolved to the Chamber's satisfaction.  The Gov's folks truly believe that the successful bond issuance depends upon an end to direct access.  Even if Bowen gets cooperation on her legislation,  Allan believes she doesn't really want to do it and is not sure she can get a signature.  I told him that Burton said he would sign off on a direct access bill if Bowen agrees to it.  That gave him little encouragement because he doesn't see much motivation for Bowen to press on the Governor and Angelides. Allan's view corresponds with everyone we've spoken to whobelieve that nothing major will happen legislatively.  A subsequent conversation with Hertzberg's office confirms that they feel unable to move an energy agenda at this time, although they have not given up.","I spoke to Allan Zaremberg, Pres. of the Cal.

2022-04-22 17:48:47+00:00,true,4,"  Three comments (""severe"" concerns?) which I am sorry I was unable to deliver before the draft order went out to all parties:  1.  I share Robert Fallon's concern.  Although the judge did say at Monday's prehearing conference that she would accept a party's ""ballpark estimate"" of its ripple claims, the express inclusion of a procedure for ripple claim offers of proof could later harm a party that remains silent on this issue, despite the draft order's statement that offers of proof are ""not required.""  2.  The draft order might benefit from an up-front definition of ripple claims.  First, though, we need to make sure that we all agree on the meaning of the terms that we are using.  Depending on how we define ripple claims, it seems to me that a counterclaim or a cross-claim could indeed be a ripple claim, and we need to be sure that we are not prejudiced by failing to assert such claims now.  A counterclaim is my claim against somebody who has asserted a claim against me.  A cross-claim is my claim against a third party who has NOT asserted a claim against me.  (As for ""offset,"" I have been under the impression that we have been using that term to describe a deduction that may validly be made from a refund amount that I am deemed to owe another party -- particularly, a deduction occasioned by that other party's unpaid bill from me.)  Presumably, each of us knows who sold power to us and the prices for those sales.  Therefore, should I so choose, I already have the ability to assert a refund claim against any of the entities that sold to me -- whether the seller has made a claim against me (making my refund claim a counterclaim) or has not made a claim against me (making my refund claim a cross-claim).  But given my opposition to ANY refunds in this case, I would prefer to refrain from asserting my own refund claims (whether counterclaims or cross-claims), while reserving my right to do so in the future should the need arise. Perhaps we should define a ripple claim simply as any refund claim that could potentially be asserted by a party that has expressed an opposition to refunds in this case.  That way, we could maintain a unified front of opposition to refunds without being prejudiced in any way from seeking our own refunds if it should come to that.  In testimony and other filings, we would make it clear that any refund directive would open the Pandora's box of wave after wave of ripple claims, but we would not need to quantify them now.  3.  The draft order, in the title, ""defer[s] ripple claims to a later phase in this proceeding.""  We want this proceeding to die -- not to live on in later phases.  Shouldn't the order simply EXCLUDE ripple claims as beyond the scope of the proceeding?   ________________________________________                                  Kevin J.

However, I question why the Judge wants the sentence at the end of the first full paragraph starting with ""In lieu of such claims..."".  That sentence totally destroys  what I thought she was trying to accomplish, i.e. keep ripple claims out of this proceeding.  It says that you can submit an offer of proof estimating the amount of ripple claims and she will certify that to the Commission.  In order to protect themselves, won't that just mean that market participants will submit their estimate of ripple refunds due and we will back in the same boat we were trying to get away from?  Thanks  Robert Fallon  ","1. I share Robert Fallon's concern. Although the judge did say at Monday's prehearing conference that she would accept a party's ""ballpark estimate"" of its ripple claims, the express inclusion of a mechanism for a ripple claim could indeed harm a party that"

2022-04-22 12:54:49+00:00,true,4,"     Q. What is the most likely approved methodology for calculating the PX credit after Jan 18?  A.  The utility's weighted average acquisition cost, excluding DWR.  Will include retained generation, ISO purchases, QF purchases.  Will exclude DWR because these were not purchases made by the utility.  Q.  What is the likelihood that the CPUC will order the utilities to implement the post-January 18 PX credit methodology by re-billing rather than prospective adjustments?  A.  Credits are likely to be calculated on a customer specific basis and applied to future billings for that customer.    Q. Will the PUC allow PG&E and SCE to modify the historic PX credit calculations (from Oct 2000 through June 2001) based on the FERC refund decision for California energy markets?  A. Yes.  Agree with Sue's comments. Implementation should be same as above question.  Q.  What is the likelihood that the CPUC will order PG&E and SCE to reinstate Enron's outstanding Net Bill amounts if the utilities fail to?  And, will the CPUC order PG&E and SCE to allow this Net Bill amount to be applied against future payments for T&D?  A. Credits will be re-instated but on a customer by customer basis.  In other words, the credit shows up on a customer's bill, not some Enron bill.  Q. What is the likelihood that the CPUC will modify its application of the 1 cent surcharge to direct access customers (a) retroactive to January 4, 2001 or (b) retroactive to March 27, 2001 or (c) prospectively?  A.  Very low.  At best, PUC makes the change retroactive to June 1, which is when the 3 cent surcharge was billed.  If the PUC reversed itself, most likely would be prospective.","Q.

2022-04-22 10:19:53+00:00,true,4,"   A few thoughts before the NG meeting --  1. Maybe we should (as a team) call Transelect (Paul Buckman) before our NG meeting.  You may remember that Transelect sent an initial letter into Skilling to try and solicit our support for stopping the NG application to be managing member of the ARTO.  I think that it would be good to call Buckman and ask if he has a better idea than NG.  We are right now stuck between two very bad answers - let AEP and FE construct a managing member or have NG.  Maybe Transelect has a better solution.  2. Chief Issues with NG -- a. are they ""really"" independent?  having a short position in NY and owning generation in NE effectively makes NG into a ""market participant"" - I think that Enron should make as a hold firm position that to operate an RTO there can be no agreement with anything less than almost perfect independence. b. who do they feel the customer is?  maybe we want to get Paul Dawson's take on their business model from the UK.  it is critical that the new RTO operators across the country view traders/marketers and generators as their key customers.  what form of regulation for cost recovery of their operating expenses do they want - pass thru, PBR, etc.?  c. who writes the tariff?  I would make a strong argument that the problem with most of the RTO work to date has been that FERC has allowed the current incumbents to first write a bad tariff and then assign the provision of service under that tariff to someone who has very little (if any) control over future changes.  the RTO operator must be free to make changes to the tariff with only two constraints - (1) must not restrict the ability to pay facility revenue reqts and (2) must not damage the assets.   d. do they intend to build/own transmission and how does this impact the energy markets?  will their planning and construction processes impact any long term positions that EPMI may take in the energy market.  how do they manage to allow other merchant transmission into the business? e. how do they intend to provide balancing energy?  the flip side of our fight on congestion management involves the pricing of energy imbalances.  what is NG intending to do on this issue?  does NG believe that multiple control areas makes sense for a single RTO?  does NG support unbalanced/uncovered schedules day-ahead?    Also, just to let people know, Kerry Stroup will also be working on the Midwest RTO efforts going forward.  Please keep him included on the e-mails.

2022-04-22 16:39:09+00:00,true,4,"   14:54 20Aug2001 RSF-Quebecers should have own citizenship - report      By Marianne White     QUEBEC CITY, Aug. 20 (Reuters) - In order to reaffirm the ""precarious"" status of French in North America, Quebecers should have their own citizenship, a provincial task force studying the status of the French language reported on Monday.     But Quebecers would not get a new passport or be asked to choose between Quebec or Canadian citizenship, the report added.     The goal is to make everyone, including new immigrants, English-speaking residents and native peoples, feel that they are part of Quebec, a French-speaking island in an English-dominated North America.     ""We want to do that in a way in which people know that linguistic policy is a fundamental characteristic of this society,"" said the chairman of the task force, Gerald Larose, a trade unionist who favors Quebec's separation from Canada.     ""As far as language is concerned, living in Quebec is not like living in Canada,"" Larose added.     The Quebec government reacted with caution to the recommendation of Quebec citizenship, saying on Monday that it shared the ideals that underlie the recommendation.     ""We do need to have a welcoming ritual for immigrants in order to send a clear message,"" said Diane Lemieux, minister responsible for the French language, adding that the government would undertake an update of its language policy.     The language task force, which crisscrossed the predominantly French-speaking province, which is three times the size of France, over the past 12 months, unveiled 149 recommendations on Monday.     It urged the Quebec government to ask for full control over immigration to ensure new arrivals will learn French, a recommendation that is not likely to please the federal government which controls immigration in conjunction with provincial governments.     The report also recommends a provincial exam for all new teachers to test their fluency in French, and says that if they fail they should not be hired. It also proposes increasing teaching hours for French, delaying the introduction of English teaching in schools by several years, and protecting the rights of Quebecers to work in French.     About 82 percent of Quebec's six million people describe French is their mother tongue. French has been Quebec's official language since 1974 and by law must dominate commercial signs, although other languages may also appear. Quebec has 1.4 million people whose first language is not French.     Language can be an emotional and divisive issue in Quebec, which has held two referendums on separating from Canada. In the last one, in 1995, Quebecers voted to remain in Canada only by a razor-thin margin.     English and French have been Canada's two official languages since 1969, with both languages spoken widely throughout the nation's history     (Marianne White, Reuters Quebec City Bureau, 418-648-6442, fax 418-648-8234, marianne.white@reuters.com)    For Related News, Double Click on one of these codes: [nN20321468] [CAN] [G] [RNP] [DNP] [PGE] [CA] [NEWS] [EDU] [LIF] [POL] [LEN] [RTRS]   Monday, 20 August 2001 14:54:03 RSF [Historical News] {C} ENDS","14:54 20Aug 2001 RSF-Quebecers should have own citizenship - report By Marianne White QUEBEC CITY, Aug. 20 (Reuters) - In order to reaffirm the ""precarious"" status of French in North America, Quebec"

2022-04-22 12:53:35+00:00,true,4,"  ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE  Vicki,  As you requested, this e-mail describes the current status of the 1 cent surcharge.  1.  The 1 cent surcharge was approved by the CPUC in early January.  At the time, the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM), to which we belong, had protested its application to DA customers. Nonetheless, the CPUC approved the surcharge and its application to all customers, including DA customers, because of the ""emergency"" nature of the situation and because it was ""temporary.""  2.  The 3 cent surcharge was approved by the CPUC in the March 27 order.  Once again, AReM had protested its application to DA customers.  This time the CPUC explicitly exempted DA customers and stated that the surcharge was for generation-related costs going forward.  The CPUC also made the one cent surcharge permanent but did not address its application to DA customers -- therefore, in my view, the earlier decision still stands on that issue. As AReM had suggested, the CPUC also stated that DA Customers would NOT be billed for the surcharge NOR given any credit for it.  3.  The March order required the utilities to file Advice Letters to implement the surcharges.  This was done in April (I think) but the SCE and PG&E took two different approaches.  SCE, because of billing system limitations, decided to violate the CPUC order in its implementation -- it billed DA customers for BOTH surcharges but then gave them a CREDIT that included both surcharges. PG&E, on the other hand, did NOT charge DA customers for the 3 cent surcharge nor include it in any credit -- in compliance with the CPUC March order.  However, PG&E continued to charge the 1 cent surcharge to DA customers in compliance with the CPUC's January order.  4.  AReM filed comments/protests on the utility advice letters -- in May, I believe.  AReM supported SCE's approach for not charging the 1 cent surcharge and for looking the closest to a ""bottoms-up"" calculation. AReM did mention that SCE should NOT be charging then crediting the surcharges, however.  AReM supported PG&E's approach of neither charging nor crediting the surcharge -- but opposed PG&E's continued charging of the 1 cent surcharge.  AReM agreed with SCE that, given the discussion in the March order and the application of the surcharges to generation-related costs going forward, the 1 cent surcharge should NOT apply to DA customers.  5.  When Advice Letters are protested, the Energy Division staff of the CPUC prepares a Resolution that recommends how to address the protested issues.  The Resolution is then presented to the CPUC at a meeting and voted on. Usually we have between one day and one week to see the Resolution before it is voted on. No Resolution has come forward on these Advice Letters.  The CPUC has no time requirement for when Advice Letters must be resolved.  6.  Discussions between AReM members and the Energy Division staff indicate that the staff agrees with AReM and will support AReM's request when it drafts the Resolution.  7.  Initiating a formal change to the January order on the 1 cent surcharge would require the filing of a Petition to Modify (usually done within a year -- but I believe can be requested at any time thereafter with a special motion).  This would begin a formal process -- also WITH NO TIME LINE.  It would also bring out the big guns opposing direct access -- the unions and TURN (a supposed small customer advocacy group) -- making quick response and a win for AReM more problematic.  8.  AReM has decided to work with the Energy Division staff and see if we can get a favorable Resolution kicked out by the end of September. (The Energy Division staff is overloaded right now with all the DWR-related decisions required for the 8/23 meeting.) If not, AReM will consider making a formal Petition to Modify.  9.  I recommend that Enron continue with its current strategy to work through AReM to achieve a favorable outcome on the 1 cent surcharge.  Sue Mara (415) 782-7802 ","1.

Since BPA did not go over the structure of the product in that account, they are not going to charge us the $12,000 per MWh, but since we did get firm transmission, we will have to pay the $59/Mwh for the firm; hence the above charges.

2022-04-22 08:42:49+00:00,true,4,"  Attached is a Word document with my notes from the PG&E meeting last Thursday August 1. I am also including an Excel spreadsheet that shows how the PX credit is calculated under the various methods that have been discussed.  My conclusion is: PG&E continues to make unpredictable and arbitrary decisions without applying with the CPUC.  If not for the PX receivable, I would recommend an immediate protest to halt this behaviour. They are also bending the existing rules so far as to strain credibility.  The SCE method of calculating a PX credit is the best choice both from a logical perspective and does not require an adjustment to our mark.  (Again, setting aside the PX receivable issue.)  Many external parties support it, the CPUC is heading in this direction. It makes sense because it keeps DA customers paying for the services they use, i.e. T&D. DA may be getting a ""break"" to the extent the current generation rate pays for ""past sins"", i.e. if market prices are below embedded generation plus the 3-cent surcharge.  This is where a yet-to-be determined nonbypassable CTC may come from.  Setting the PX credit equal to the Market Price is unlikely to be approved, on a go-forward basis.  If PX Credit = Market, the  DA customer will only pay frozen rates.  Although this confirms to AB1890 since the rate freeze is not technically over, it is unlikely that this will go forward since: bundled customers are paying more than rate-freeze rates there is no agreed-upon market price    ",Attached is a Word document with my notes from the PG&E meeting last Thursday August 1.

Charley will draft alternative Complaints.   He will get the input of the bankruptcy lawyers on the draft PG&E complaint.  I will circulate these drafts as soon as they are available.       2.

2022-04-22 16:38:16+00:00,true,4,"   13:39 20Aug2001 RSF-ANALYSIS-Brazil energy diet slims utilities' accounts      By Andrei Khalip     RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The latest corporate results by Brazilian power utilities provided only a glimpse of the impact of energy rationing that started in June, but enough for analysts to say the sector is probably the most hard-hit by Brazil's economic woes.     Coupled with a sharp depreciation of the real currency, which has lost about one-fourth of its dollar value so far this year, and an overall economic slowdown, power rationing should hammer energy companies further in coming months.     ""Although the currency's depreciation was the main culprit of poor results in the second quarter and first half, power rationing has already shown its face,"" said Oswaldo Telles, power sector analyst with BBV Securities.     ""And it will get worse for power utilities this quarter.""     The government was forced to resort to tough power rationing in June, ordering Brazilians to knock 20 percent off their usual power consumption, in order to avert crippling blackouts amid an acute power shortage.     Brazil is dependent on hydroelectric plants for over 90 percent of its electricity. Two years of drought and full use of power stations' capacity to feed a growing economy dried up reservoir levels and triggered the worst energy crisis in at least 30 years in Latin America's largest country.     Rationing, due to last at least until November, means lower sales and revenues for power firms, while their costs and dollar-denominated debt get inflated by the real's losses.     ""It's only the beginning of rationing, but it gives us an idea of how power utilities, distributors in particular, will be affected,"" said Eduardo de la Pena of Banco Santander. ""I think we can say that they are suffering the most.""     Out of electricity sector stocks, most analysts only have a buy recommendation for Copel <CPLE3.SA> of southern Parana state, where there is no energy shortage and no rationing.     GOVERNMENT HELP SOUGHT     Among the big losers in the past six months were Sao Paulo's Cesp <CESP4.SA> utility whose losses rose sharply and   Eletropaulo <ELPL4.SA>, controlled by US-based AES Corp. <AES.N>, which posted a net loss after a year-ago profit.     Rio de Janeiro's power distributor Light <LIGH3.SA> last week posted its biggest half-year loss ever of 431 million reais ($172 million) and Light officials said the company should suffer big losses this year with revenues falling at least 10 percent due to the rationing program.     The main problem for companies is that the government fixes electricity prices in Brazil -- even though most distributors had long been privatized -- and allows the adjustments to compensate for higher costs only once a year.     ""This year, their costs grew so violently that when the adjustments came it was about time to adjust tariffs again,"" said Telles. ""But they just have to wait till next year.     Analysts said the only bright spot may be that the government will allow companies to start adjusting tariffs twice in one year. There are rumors of such a change although analysts recognize such an unpopular measure would be difficult in the run-up to presidential elections next year.    In an ironic twist, power distributors are now spending money on lawyers to defend in court the government's order for power switchoffs for quota-busters -- the measure that effectively slashes their revenues.     In the meantime, the companies are banking on an obscure contractual clause, known as Annex V, that should compensate them for lost revenue due to rationing. Some have even booked that gain in the latest results, although the government has so far not confirmed that it will pay.     ""Annex V is the biggest question for power firms. If there is no compensation, they are screwed,"" said another analyst.

2022-04-22 18:18:34+00:00,true,4,"  Steve --   Thanks.  Looks good.  Some thoughts for you to consider:   1.    Not sure that Impact #1 makes sense to present.  No real reason to set CTC = 0 c/kwh on Jan 5 (CalPX was still in operation).  I think that Impact #2 better captures the idea.  Also, probably not good to use the term ""CTC Eliminated"".  Maybe should say ""CTC = 0 c/kwh"".  Given the CPUC's March 27 Order, the Utilities have a claim for additional generation related stranded costs until March 31, 2002.   2.     In calculating Impact #2, what did you use as the Jan 19 - Aug baseline?  Did you calculate the hit of ($104.5) from actual bills or based on our DJ Index model (there is a fundamental difference in likelihood based on the baseline)?  Also, I assume that the Feb - Aug timeframe was relatively low because EES and EEMC had most of their load on bundled service.   3.    Probably should discuss in a footnote the different models for PX Credit calculation and most specifically the PG&E Adjustment.  Also, may be interesting to have the $ impact of the PG&E Adjustment (the rate adjustment to re-capture their previous mistake).  I think that this is something we need to go into the CPUC to fight pretty quickly.   4.    Should Impact #4 and Impact #5 apply to SCE's loads?  In column 4 it looks like it does.  SCE is not currently hitting our bills with this surcharge.   5.    Probably better to model Impact #5 as of Oct 1 not Sept 1.   6.    Can you break out the volumes for ""vintage"" contracts versus ""retail gen with passthru"" contracts?  You haven't shown anything for (a) Utility Undercollection costs or (b) CDWR bond fees.  These costs may hit our vintage contracts.   Jim  ",Steve -- Thanks. Looks good. Some thoughts for you to consider: 1. Not sure that Impact #1 makes sense to present. No real reason to set CTC = 0 c/kwh on Jan 5 (CalPX was still in operation). I think that Impact #2 better captures the

Specifically, SCE is seeking resolution of the following issues:  (1) How should SCE calculate the direct access credit from January 19, 2001 forward?  (2) If schedule PE is adopted on an interim basis, what should replace the PE credit on a going forward basis?  (3) Should direct access customers receive a credit for the one cent surcharge?  (4) Should customers who switched or will switch from bundled service to DA after DWR began procuring energy for bundled service customers be charged for DWR costs?  (5) How would the transition costs, if any, that are the responsibility of DA customers be determined in the absence of a transparent energy price?  SCE is asking that the commission expeditiously resolve these issues as part of this proceeding.  We may want to chime in an support SCE on this.  Answers to the motion are due on August 27th.

I would appreciate it if those of = you with more first-hand information, particularly Wanda and Diann, correct=  or clarify anything I've misstated.  Also, please forward this to anyone e= lse with an interest in this matter.  A.  Recoupment of the PX Credit (also known as the ""Negative CTC"")       1.  Background:  The issue here relates to the fact that PG&E and SCE = are no longer reflecting credit balances on the bills for our customers.  P= rior to our returning the customers to bundled service in March, the bills = would reflect the PX Credit as an offset to T&D charges.  SCE and PG&E have=  now removed the PX Credit from the bill and are attempting to charge us fo= r T&D, despite the fact that they owe us hundreds of millions of dollars in=  PX Credits.  The PX credit has been replaced with the PE credit, so we are=  receiving an energy credit, just not calculated the same way as the PX.   = This is potentially harmful particularly in view of the opinion of perhaps = three of the Commissioners that the PX Credit can only be collected as a bi= ll credit, and not in cash.  Mike Day, our regulatory lawyer, expressed his=  strong opinion that removing the Credit from the bills was improper, and t= hat we should challenge the action by making a filing with the CPUC.  Note:=   the PX Credit to which I am referring here is that which accrued to prior=  to December 31, 2000; the utilities do not dispute that a PX Credit accrue= d during that time frame, and there is no dispute as to the proper methodol= ogy for computing the PX Credit for that time frame.  Furthermore, PG&E and=  SCE are in virtual agreement with us as to the amount of the Credit that h= ad accrued as of December 31, 2000.      2.   Action Items/Issues:  (a)  With respect to SCE, Legal is evaluatin= g filing a suit in federal court versus filing at the CPUC.  The CPUC has a=  process whereby we could prevent the utilities from disconnecting our cust= omers while the issue is being determined (by depositing the payments in an=  interest-bearing account controlled by the CPUC); while there is no equiva= lent procedure in federal court, one can request that the court enter an in= junction against the utilities disconnecting customers.   While the analysi= s is worth doing, I suspect that we will conclude that we have to go to the=  CPUC for relief.  (b)  With respect to PG&E, the banruptcy team is evaluat= ing whether to file at the CPUC or in bankruptcy court.      3.  Timing:  Late fees will begin accruing August 20.  I will need to c= onfirm when late fees will begin accruing.  SCE late charges are calcuated = at .9% of total owing.  The first disconnect notices would not be received = until September 19.  Disconnect notices will be directed to Enron not the c= ustomer.  PG&E will begin demanding payment before SCE.      4.  Effect on other CTC issues:  Pursuing action at the CPUC or in cour= t to force the utilities to restore the PX Credit   to our bills has no eff= ect on the issues of how the CTC should be calculated post-January 17, and = prospectively.  Both utilities are providing a credit (PE) at this time.  I= t is their methodology we are disputing.  B.  $10 Surcharge       1.  Backgound:  Although when provisionally imposed in January the $10=  surcharge went to the utilities to keep them financially solvent,  when ma= de permanent in March it became dedicated to defray the DWR's purchases of = power on behalf of the utilities.  This evolution gives rise to two bases f= or EES to argue that it should not bear the financial burden of the $10 sur= charge.  First, since the $10 surcharge is now dedicated to purchasing gene= ration for bundled customers only, and not direct access customers, direct = access should not have to pay it.  This is the same logic that caused the C= PUC to exempt direct access customers from the $30 surcharge. Secondly, if legitimately applied to direct access, because it is of no dir= ect benefit to direct access customers it (arguably) can only be viewed as = a tax.  Under EES's contracts with its customers, taxes assessed at the del= ivery point are borne by the customer.  Note:  SCE, unlike PG&E, may not im= pose the $10 surcharge on direct access customers, according to a filing ma= de at the staff level at the CPUC, so this action may relate to PG&E only. =  SCE is NOT imposing the $10 surcharge as it is credited back to us in the = PE credit. =20       2.  Action Items/Issues:  (a)  Regulatory (Jim Steffes) has the lead i= n advising us about a challenge to the application of the $10 surcharge to = direct access customers at the CPUC.  It may be advisable for an industry g= roup rather than Enron to make the filing.  (b)  I would expect that we wou= ld follow the same procedure outlined above--depositing the payment with th= e CPUC--to prevent any customer from being disconnected.  In the interim we=  would likely bill the customer for the surcharge and promise a credit if o= ur challenge to the application of the surcharge to DA customers is success= ful. (c) A decision will need to be made on how far we go back--to July 1 w= hen the customers became DA again or to January 4 when the surcharge was fi= rst imposed.       3.  Timing.  Same timeframe as with the Recoupment issue since we will=  need to have CPUC challenge on file to prevent late fees and disconnect no= tices.       4.  Effect on other CTC issues:  Regulatory (Jim Steffes) will analyze=  with the appropriate people the effect, if any, of taking this position on=  other CTC issues (principally how CTC should be calculated post-January 17= , and prospectively). CTC's have not been collected since the PX prices wen= t out of control last year.  It is the Procured Energy Credit we need to ch= allenge.  End.    =20   =20  ","Bob, see my comments below.

From: James D Steffes/ENRON@enronXgate on 08/16/2001 09:59 AM To: Mike D Smith/HOU/EES@EES cc:   Subject: California Contract Language   Some thoughts --  1. Why use the ""Special"" term?  Just call it DA Charges.  What makes these charges special.  Parallels the def we use of ""Special Utility Charges.""  Also connotes that these are often imposed outside the normal course of business. 2. Why limit to ""energy procurement"" or ""public purpose""?  For instance, if the Utilities were to implement a line item charge for past Negative CTC payments, I don't think your language would cover this. Isn't that ""future payback of past under collections""?  Seems to me to relate to energy procurement--ie their avoided cost of energy procurement 3. Does this include the potential for ""positive CTC""?  We don't want to miss this cost.  Customer pays CTC as part of ""T&D Charges.""  CTC is expressly included in the definition of those charges. 4. What do we do with post March 31, 2002 rate periods?  While the AB1890 rate freeze is premised to continue until March 31, 2002 or when generation-related stranded costs are recovered, we don't know what will be happening after then.  Want to make sure that any non-bypassable charge is paid by customers, including T&D, along with our generation rates.  All T&D is passed through to customer, regardless of when.  We have only priced ""retail"" generation on these deals.   5. How does the concept of re-billing versus prospective rate adjustments get incorporated?  Maybe it gets built into the calculation of CTC, but want to make sure that the right value goes to the right party.  I think the rebilling as opposed to prospective will follow the allocation of charges in the contract.  We talk about things like ""however styled or payable"" to pick up things like that.

Existing law requires the commission to identify certain             generation-related costs of electrical corporations that             are uneconomic under the restructuring of the electrical             industry, and provides for recovery of those uneconomic             costs by the corporations from customers in a specified             manner.            This bill would provide that these and certain related             provisions are repealed on January 1, 2002.            The Public Utilities Act provides for the continued             regulation by the commission of the facilities for the             generation of electricity owned by any public utility prior             to January 1, 1997, but pursuant to Chapter 2 of the             2001-02 First Extraordinary Session, also prohibits any             disposal of a facility of this nature prior to January 1,             2006.            This bill would enact new provisions authorizing the             commission to require an electrical corporation to make             direct investments in generation facilities, and providing             for the commission to approve rates sufficient to support             that investment.  The bill would prohibit the commission,             on or before January 1, 2006, from reducing a specified             electrical corporation's authorized rate of return on             generation assets below a certain level, if the electrical             corporation has entered into the specified binding and             enforceable agreement with the state described above.""    Existing provisions of the Public Utilities Act restructuring the electrical industry establish a process  for the recovery by electrical corporations regulated by             the Public Utilities Commission of uneconomic transition             costs for a certain period of time, and requires the             commission to establish a mechanism for recovery of these             costs.","Jim: During the CA call today, you requested a copy of this bill and asked about its language concerning rates after March 02. *This is the link to the bill: http://info.sen.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_"

2022-04-22 22:45:04+00:00,true,4,"  Angela -  The value proposition for a customer is related to which buckets of cost would be bypassed by switching to DA.  If a customer goes DA after August 24, 2001 (based on the discussion about surcharges in the legislation that has only passed the Assembly Energy Committee last night - with still a very low probability of success of being signed by the Governor), the customer would pay for SCE undercollection (PG&E isn't being discussed on this piece), DWR bond costs, and DWR net unavoidable.   The hardest piece to calculate - which Belden said on the last call he simply couldn't given the tremendous uncertainty - is the DWR net unavoidable.  If the customer has been DA since July 1, the customer could avoid the DWR net unavoidable (but the legislation could change or not pass and the CPUC could do something else).  Each customer needs to appreciate this latest information and make a determination about what these amounts will be - the key question I'd ask a customer is that they need to try and keep their options open.  Of course, all of this assumes that the CPUC doesn't go back and suspend DA even earlier than July 1 or something else crazy happens - remember this is California.

2022-04-22 17:19:22+00:00,true,4,"  The following are some of the proposed amendments to SBX2 78, in concept. The amendments were developed by the Administration and Assembly Democratic leadership and have not been finalized, nor have they been run past the Senate in full detail.  It is unlikely that the Assembly will take the bill up this week.  Direct Access: SBX2 78 will contain the final DA provisions from ABX2 82 which are located in Water Code Section 80110.  The amendments, in short, provide that customers may switch during open enrollment periods provided that there is enough head room and in proportion to the customer class.  The Assembly has apparently convinced the Treasurer that DA can exist provided there are non-bypassable charges and specified exit fees.  Threshold: The payment threshold will be lowered to 20 kw for 100% of the undercollection despite the Senate's objections.  Lowering the threshold to 20 kw will probably force some of the liberal Democrats off the bill but will bring even more of the moderate Democrats on to the bill.  Tax Refund: SCE will keep the $400 million projected tax refund and not have that amount applied towards the bonding amount.  Easements: The easements are currently in the bill, however, they may need to come out in order to secure moderate Democratic votes.  Renewable Portfolio Standard:  The RPS from ABX2 82 will be included in SBX2 78.   ","The following are some of the proposed amendments to SBX2 78, in concept.

2022-04-22 09:05:55+00:00,true,4,"  Bob --  Before we do anything on this issue, I would suggest that we need to have developed a strategy on a number of issues (primarily the proper reformation of the PX Credit calculation after Jan 18 and the application of the 1c/kwh surcharge).  On this issue, assuming that we haven't discuss the failure of SCE to apply our account's past credit with the CPUC (given that the bills were just received), I can't imagine that a federal court would look to favorably upon a legal action.    In addition, we have not identified where the ""credits"" are if they are not on the customer's accounts.    My recommendation is to first (a) work with SCE - have Jeff Dasovich run the traps and (b) discuss the issue with CPUC Division of Energy and see if there is a solution without Complaint.   If this doesn't get us anywhere before August 19, then it seems that to protect our interest we would need to file a complaint with the CPUC.

Amendments should be available tomorrow.  SBX 78 (Polanco) - The Governor's office called a meeting earlier today of the business community to discuss a strategy for moving SBX 78 out of Appropriations and off of the Assembly floor.  The Governor asked that the business community try to get support from Republicans.  Assemblyman Leonard, who was the lone Republican to vote for the bill yesterday, is meeting with Republicans now to try and get their support.  It is widely held that his rationale for voting for the bill was because he was concerned that if the bill did not get out in its current form, liberal Democrats would have amended the bill to look more like the original bill. This is likely the reason why they need Republicans now.  Assembly session begins at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow and Appropriations will be held off the floor.

2022-04-22 14:35:34+00:00,true,4,"   17 August 2001  Brookhaven Energy Project Permit Application Ruled Complete by New York State Regulators  (London - 17 August 2001) International Power plc, one of the world's leading independent power producers, today announces that the New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment has accepted as complete its application to build the Brookhaven Energy Project on Long Island. The Siting Board's decision marks the beginning of the State's formal review process, and is a key regulatory milestone for the 580- megawatt natural gas fired electric generating facility. The ruling kicks- off a yearlong review process that will involve public hearings.  International Power submitted the application for their proposed energy facility with the Siting Board, as required under Article X of the State of New York Public Service Law, on June 25, 2001. This application, which the State ruled as meeting the minimum requirements for compliance, addresses all of the pertinent environmental and siting issues of the project, including its design, location, fuel use, and air and water quality.  ""The New York Siting Board's ruling puts us a step closer to providing Long Island with a clean and affordable new source of electric power,"" said Peter Giller, International Power's Chief Executive Officer. ""We are planning to begin construction of Brookhaven in the third quarter of next year and expect to have the plant in service by the end of 2004,"" he added.  For additional information, please contact:  Media contact: (Europe) Aarti Singhal +44 (0)20-7320-8681  Media & Investor contact: (United States) Paul Parshley +1 508-922-3124  Notes to Editors-  The Brookhaven Energy project is proposed for development on 28 acres of industrially zoned land just south of the Long Island Expressway at exit 66 and along the southeast corner of Sills Road in the Town of Brookhaven. When completed, the plant will provide enough energy to power over half a million homes. The project will also result in additional significant benefits to the region, including job creation and substantial tax benefits.  International Power plc is one of the world's leading independent electric generating companies with over 8,850 MW (net) in operation, 2,350 MW (net) under construction and approximately 8,000 MW (net) in advanced development. Among the countries where International Power has operating facilities are Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Turkey, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand. International Power was created from the demerger of National Power, and its shares began trading independently on the London Stock Exchange and as ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange on 2 October 2000.

2022-04-22 14:07:56+00:00,true,4,"   12:24 16Aug2001 RSF-Canada blisters under ""year with too much summer""      By Kanina Holmes     WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Canadians, sometimes divided by regional differences, economic disparities or linguistic snits, find themselves united this summer by an uncomfortable phenomenon -- a national drought.     From Atlantic to Pacific, from the Arctic to the U.S. border, most of the world's second-largest country has been sweating through weeks of blistering heat that experts say could end up being the worst drought in decades.     ""In many ways, this drought is the same tune that's being played right across the country. It's a different look, different season and different impact, but nevertheless, everybody has a water shortage problem in many parts of the country,"" said David Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment Canada.     Whether it's fires raging in the forests of British Columbia and Quebec, barren Prairie plains or harsh restrictions on water usage in Ontario, many will remember the summer of 2001.     ""It'll be memorable for the wrong reasons I think. Too much excess and not enough normal,"" said Phillips.     In parts of British Columbia, water management officials say the tinderbox conditions are largely the result of last winter's record low snowfall in the mountains.     ""We've had normal summer in terms of rain. But we knew back in March with the low snowpack that if we had a normal summer we were going to be in trouble,"" said Jim Mattison, Water Management Director for B.C's Bureau of Sustainable Resources.     But the devastation is most apparent in Canada's breadbasket, the Prairies. Many farmers, especially in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, have already written off their crops.     ""I've been here since '63. I have never in my life, ever, seen anything like this,"" Norman Stienwand, a farmer in Castor, Alberta, told Reuters.     ""IT'S BEYOND YOUR IMAGINATION""     ""There's no water. The grasshoppers are so bad. It's beyond your imagination,"" said Stienwand who farms 1,080 hectares (2,700 acres) of grains and oilseeds and also raises beef cattle.     It has been so sweltering in his region, located about 160 km (100 miles) west of the Saskatchewan border, that some of Stienwand's farm machinery caught fire this week as he tried to bale a meager barley crop into hay for his livestock.     ""It's just going to destroy a lot of farmers. They're just not going to come out of it,"" he said.     In June, the Alberta government declared a drought disaster to trigger emergency aid to livestock farmers struggling to feed and water their herds, and, as many of the withered and patchy crops are harvested, many analysts are already anticipating sharp reductions in yields and quality.     Last week, the Canadian Wheat Board, the marketer of western Canada's wheat, durum and barley crops, forecast a 10 to 15 percent decline in exports.     In Ontario, Canada's most populous province, prime agricultural areas have received only about 15 percent of the precipitation they would normally see.     ""You wouldn't be able to fill a sardine can with the rain they've got since the twenty-second of June,"" said Phillips.     The drought has created ideal conditions for billions of Asian aphids to infest Ontario's soybean crop.     ""I drive by and actually now I just shut my eyes and pretend I don't see it. It's just really, really, really dry,"" said Debbie Yuck, a farmer who lives near Ottawa and who has watched her corn whither and yellow over the past few weeks.     ""When they come on (the radio) every morning and say it's a beautiful sunny day, great to be at the cottage, I think a beautiful day would a good downpour for about 16 hours,"" said Yuck.     Canada's largest city, Toronto, has experienced a record number of days with health alerts because of the heat and smog, with temperatures soaring as high as 37 C (99 F). Some Ontario residents now face fines for watering their yards.     An Ontario woman was recently charged for dropping incendiary material near a forest after she threw her lit cigarette butt on a road in front of a police officer.     ""THE YEAR WITH TOO MUCH SUMMER""     ""I wish I could come up with a word that would describe the misery and the hardship that urban and rural folk are feeling,"" said Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment Canada who tracks national weather patters.     ""I would describe it maybe as the year with too much summer.""     The hot, dry spell could be a blow to the national economy. By the time the final bill is tallied for lost crops, aiding farmers, battling forest fires and generating more electricity, it could run into the billions.     Quebec's multibillion-dollar agricultural sector, which accounts for some 16 percent of the Canadian industry's revenues and produces 38 percent of the country's milk, has also been hard hit since early July.     In southern Quebec, where it has not rained for five weeks despite bouts of high heat and humidity, vegetable farmers have been working around the clock to save sun-ravaged crops.     ""The farmers are on the edge of burn-out, they can barely stand up,"" said David St-Cyr, a spokesman for Quebec's powerful Agricultural Union.     The Atlantic provinces have also been caught in the oppressive heat, the result of massive high pressure systems in the United States that, for weeks, have blocked the circulation of other weather patterns trying to make their way north.     Clouds of red dust follow behind potato producers working the parched fields on Prince Edward Island, growers who may lose 25 percent of their crop. Blueberries in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have shriveled to look like raisins.     ""I think there are a majority of Canadians, probably, who can hardly wait for the winter. And I never thought I'd ever hear that,"" said Phillips.

2022-04-22 17:44:32+00:00,true,4,"  Presiding Judge Birchman:  I sent an email out yesterday morning with call-in information for our Tuesday 4pm call, asking for participation by representatives of all potential groups to talk about grouping and the Burbank motion issues.  The call occurred with numerous participants and lasted about 2? hours.  Out of the hundreds of parties in this case, our initial canvassing came up with 12 potential groups, though less than half of those groups plan to file testimony or conduct cross-examination about the generic proxy price calculation issues at this time.  The universe of potential groups comprise the following:  (1) the ISO (2) the PX (3) the California Parties (3 state entities and the 3 IOUs). (4) the Generators (5) the Marketers (6) Out-of-State Load-Serving Entities (7) California Non-Jurisdictional Entities (8) Net Buyer Out-of-State Non-Jurisdictional Entities (9) Net Seller Out-of-State Non-Jurisdictional Entities (10) the Small Generators (11) Federal Seller Entities (such as BPA) (12) FERC Trial Staff  In addition, there are certain out-of-state governmental entities, such as state regulators, that take the position they should not be a member of any group, given their unique responsibilities.  We did not, on this call, attempt to reduce this list.  Certain smaller potential groups will be exploring the feasibility of joining a larger group.  We then explored groupings on an issue-by-issue basis, to determine what effect the above grouping approach would have on the conduct of the trial.  We determined that, at this time, and subject to change as the parties analyze data, only a few groups planned to sponsor witnesses or participate in cross-examination on the core generic issue in this case:  Issue 1 regarding the calculation of the proxy price.  Specifically, at this time, that issue will be addressed at trial by the ISO, the California Parties, the Generators, the Marketers and FERC Trial Staff.  In addition, it appears that some groups may seek separate status only for the purpose of filing concise briefs, not to participate during the trial.  We then turned to the related matters involving Issues 2 and 3 and the Burbank Motion, which concern individual amounts owed and owing.  I am authorized to state that Burbank does not request that the Presiding Judge act on or receive answers to its motion at this time.  Consistent with the discussions at the prehearing conference, the Parties will seek to narrow the scope of individualized issues as follows:  First, the ISO will work with parties to reconcile inconsistencies or errors in data reflected in the ISO's recent presentation.  We hope that most if not all such matters, which could be as simple as a transposed set of numbers, can be resolved by the parties.  Second, we are drafting a stipulation that would address individualized issues.  For example, as noted at the prehearing conference, a number of parties believe that many such issues, including settlement and payment disputes, are being, or will be, properly resolved in other forums, such as arbitration under the ISO tariff or the PG&E bankruptcy, and cannot be resolved in this case.  We are seeking to develop an approach that will involve narrow presentations on these issues, perhaps by affidavit, that would require little or no cross-examination, in a way that preserves the rights of the parties to litigate such matters to finality elsewhere.  Our objective in these efforts is to minimize the hearing time and burden involved in resolving any individualized issues, consistent with the current trial schedule.  Obviously, however, at this point in time, when the ISO and PX are still producing data and the parties are just beginning to analyze what already has been produced, no one is in a position to waive any right to raise individualized issues.  We will attempt to further define these matters arising under Issues 2 and 3 as part of our groupings effort, prompted by review of the draft stipulation.  In terms of process, we concluded that given our progress on Tuesday's call, and given (a) the need for individual parties to explore potential changes in groupings and (b) the pending work on the draft stipulation, it would not be productive to have another call on Wednesday.  We tentatively agreed to a call next Tuesday afternoon (rehearing of the Commission's July 25 order is due on Friday and on Monday numerous parties will be filing testimony in the Pacific Northwest hearing).  We hope this will give sufficient time for drafting and review of the stipulation, which will help focus us on the details involved in resolving the ""individualized"" issues.  We will continue to work on the above matters and would appreciate any input the Presiding Judge might have.","Presiding Judge Birchman: I sent an email out yesterday morning with call-in information for our Tuesday 4pm call, asking for participation by representatives of all potential groups to talk about grouping and the Burbank motion issues.

Regarding the first matter, Gary reviewed with us the initial numbers on California exposure relating to our sales in the ISO and PX markets, and our purchases in those markets which may potentially be used to offset this exposure.  We discussed the need to update this study in view of the new data recently provided by the ISO in the proceeding.  Gary will work with Charles River to move forward on this.  The new exposure/netting numbers should be available either at the end of this week, or the middle of next week, due to demands on Charles River related to a Monday filing deadline in the Pac NW proceeding.  A ""block forward"" issue related to our accounting for sales and purchases, and involving the inclusion of price data related to non-physical, swap transactions, will also be analyzed by Charles River to determine its effect on the numbers that are being generated by the ISO and its impact on our refund exposure.    2. I shared information related to money owed us by the ISO for business conducted in various trade months, developed with the help of Kit Blair.  This info takes the form of a certification by the chief financial officer of the ISO as to the correctness of various attached information, schedules and invoices generated by ISO and related to these various trade months.  Kit advises as of yesterday that we are owed $42,891,411 by the ISO.  3. Information was also shared with regard to amounts owed us by the PX for business conducted in various trade months.  This info took the form of an EPMI account summary on PX letterhead and an overview spread sheet (with accompanying backup data) apparently provided by ISO.  The contact person on this matter is Chris Stokley.  I do not have confirmation on an up to date figure yet from Chris, but my prior notes indicate that this receivable is approximately $8MM.  4. I also shared information on money due us by virtue of the underscheduling penalty mechanism.  Again, Kit Blair provided me this info, which consists of an ISO generated notice and schedule which indicates that EPMI is owed $33,838,246.08  5. Finally, I shared a spread sheet obtained from Wanda Curry, as to the magnitude of the negative CTC receivable.  The deliverables coming out of the meeting were for Gary and Amanda to take the lead in updating and developing the foregoing items into evidentiary proof/affidavits suitable for use in the proceeding, coordinating with us, Dan Watkiss / Shelby Kelley and the various contacts.  A listing of the contacts to be made and potential affiants/witnesses follows:   Contact for amounts owed us by ISO-  Kit Blair, Staff Trading Supt. Contact for amounts owed us by PX-  Chris Stokley, Associate Affiant for the info developed above- Murray O'Neil, Sr. Director Trading Supt.   Contact and affiant for negative CTC-  Wanda Curry, VP Risk Management Offset of purchases and sales-  Undefined; possibilities- Jan Acton, Seabron Adamson,        internal person?  I am available for the remainder of the week to help coordinate Gary and Amanda's communication with these contacts.  Alan Comes will be the primary coordinator next week during my absence; although I will be reachable on my cell should the need arise.   Thanks,  Ray   ","4. I called a meeting among Linda Robertson, Gary Fergus, Amanda Smith and RA yesterday evening to compare notes on the status of the captioned matters and determine what activities we would need to undertake going forward.

2022-04-22 14:11:57+00:00,true,4,"   This note is to report on two electricity legislative developments: the Aug. 2nd introduction of an anti-RTO bill (or at least anti-mandatory RTOs) and on a meeting I had yesterday afternoon with Andy Black, the policy coordinator for Chairman Joe Barton on the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, to discuss their intentions with respect to electricity legislation this Fall.  1.  H.R. 2814 (Reps. Tom Sawyer (D-OH) and Richard Burr (R-NC))  On Aug. 2nd (the last day Congress was in session before the August Recess), the above named members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee introduced H.R. 2814, the Interstate Transmission Act.  The legislation is bad because, among other things, it requires FERC to establish transmission pricing policies that provide incentives for voluntary participation and formation of RTOs, with language prohibiting policies that have the effect of forcing transmitting utilities to join RTOs.  Also objectionable is that the bill would ""limit"" pancaking but at the same time require FERC to establish a ""reasonable transition mechanism or period"" for additive charges.  The legislation prohibits FERC from conditioning any order upon a transmitting utility being required to transfer operational control of jurisdictional facilities to an ISO or RTO.  The bill would require that participating transmitting utilities must approve the form, structure and operating entity of any RTO.  In addition to the RTO language, the bill has the ""old"" version of the NERC reliability legislation in it.  The bill also has a PUHCA exemption for RTOs, repeals Federal Power Act sec. 203 on the disposition of property and includes the tax changes that IOUs seek for transfers of property to an independent transmission company.  Barbara Hueter advises that First Energy has its hq in Rep. Sawyer's district.  Rep. Burr is from North Carolina, so perhaps Duke had its utility hat on in working with him.  I am checking into where Duke is on this issue.  Rep. Burr is the Vice Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and close to Chairman Tauzin -- so his support for this legislation is significant (see Andy Black comment below).  2.  Andy Black Meeting  Andy is meeting with various trade associations this month to discuss electricity legislation.  He is only meeting with a few companies on a one-on-one basis -- Enron, Reliant, Dynegy and TXU.  His timing is to have a legislative draft for Chairman Barton to review when Congress returns after Labor Day.  If Chairman Barton approves or makes changes, the draft will be circulated to members of the subcommittee and the public for further comment.  The intent is to mark up an electricity bill this Fall so that if the Senate acts on electricity in its comprehensive energy bill, the issue will be ripe for consideration in a House-Senate conference committee.  Here is a run down of my comments and Andy's comments on specific issues.  a.   RTOs  Chairman Barton supports RTOs.  At a minimum, the draft will affirm FERC's authority as the commissioners have requested.  Andy is considering going beyond that to mandate RTO participation.  Not sure he can hold that position in the subcommittee.  He is looking to Enron and others to help them explain and build support for RTOs.  Informed him of our initial informal coalition steps.  However, Andy asked me to look at sec. 3 of the Sawyer-Burr referenced above, which I realized after the meeting is the part that deals with incentive rates and negotiated rates to expand transmission and voluntary RTOs.  I have a call in to Andy to reconcile these statements since the Sawyer-Burr bill is based on voluntary RTOs.  Hopefully, he is thinking of using the incentive and negotiated rate language and NOT the objectionable voluntary RTO aspects.  I will strongly encourage him to ""do the right thing"" in that regard.  b.   PUHCA  The draft will use the Pickering bill (H.R. 1101).  Told Andy about our concerns with the record keeping provisions of that bill.  Will send him our legislative language to clarify these provisions so that they do not open up all of Enron's records -- even those unrelated to transactions with a regulated utility affiliate.  c.  PURPA  Prospective repeal.  On back up power, they are thinking of requiring that rates for back up power be just and reasonable until there is retail competition in the state.  d.   Interconnection  They have received a proposal from Trigen that Andy says we will like.  I am contacting EPSA to get the details.  e.   Net Metering  They are likely to include the Inslee bill to require ""net metering.""  I explained our concern that the bill's mandate applies to all retail energy suppliers -- including EES -- even though this should only apply to utilities with an obligation to serve; that it does not make sense to mandate it on service providers like EES (per Jim's helpful comments yesterday).  I need to get more information to Andy.  f.   Transmission Jurisdiction  Thankfully, Andy is NOT going to use those portions of the bill as reported by subcommittee in the last Congress that gave use heart burn on jurisdiction.  Specifically, the draft will not say FERC does not have jurisdiction over the transportation component of a bundled retail sale -- the draft will not get into the bundled/unbundled issue at all.  The draft will bring munis, co-ops and PMAs under the FERC umbrella for transmission jurisdiction purposes.  g.   Siting  On siting, Andy is thinking of some type of mechanism that would give a State one year before federal eminent domain attaches.  h.   Reliability  On a negative note, Andy intends to use the latest NERC reliability language because NERC's version has strong support among the Members of the subcommittee and no other alternative has emerged with political support (i.e., not PJM).  I explained our concerns.  He said our best bet is for DoE or FERC to come forward to seek something other than the NERC version.  He said Members eyes glaze over on reliability with everything else on the plate.  i.   Negawatts  I raised the absence of negawatts on his issue list.  He said he is open to considering it again, but that there was left over political baggage and unresolved issues from when this was attempted during consideration of the ""California bill"" earlier this summer.  Your questions and comments on the any of the above are most welcome.","This note is to report on two electricity legislative developments: the Aug. 2nd introduction of an anti-RTO bill (or at least anti-mandatory RTOs) and on a meeting I had yesterday afternoon with Andy Black, the policy coordinator for Chairman Joe Barton of the House Energy"

2022-04-22 20:52:39+00:00,true,5,"  Baylor team moves closer to solving MD puzzle  By ERIC BERGER  Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle Science Writer  Scientists have known for a decade what mutated gene causes the most common type of muscular dystrophy in adults, but until recently they have not fully understood why the mutation causes the disease.  Growing evidence, the newest of which will appear today in the journal Nature Genetics, is giving medical researchers the answer to this ""why"" question, which in turn should enhance their ability to devise effective therapies.  Baylor College of Medicine researchers will report perhaps the strongest evidence yet supporting a theory that excess RNA, the molecule that spurs production of proteins in the body, can effectively clog cells and lead to muscle weakness and other ailments.  ""The more you know, and the better you understand how things work, the smarter you'll be when developing drugs,"" said one of the study's three authors, Dr. Thomas A. Cooper, a Baylor associate professor of pathology.  Cooper and his Baylor colleagues, Drs. Rajesh S. Savkur and Anne V. Philips, are studying patients with myotonic dystrophy whose faulty insulin receptors do not process enough blood sugar for their muscles to work properly.  The disease is particularly devastating, Cooper said, because it runs in families, often getting worse with each subsequent generation. Afflicting about 30,000 Americans, myotonic dystrophy worsens over time, weakening muscles, causing cataracts and even mental retardation.  ""It's a very unfair disease to families,"" he said.  The mutated gene of those with myotonic dystrophy makes too many copies of RNA, which, in turn, produce the wrong types of proteins that muscles need to process blood sugar.  The genes of healthy people have only a few excess RNA copies, always less than three dozen. Patients with moderate forms of myotonic dystrophy have hundreds of copies, and the most severe forms of the disease, sometimes seen in children, can have thousands of copies.  Now scientists will know where to look for better treatments -- such as dissolving the globs of RNA -- and in places they did not consider before.  ""This is a big step forward,"" said Dr. Sharon Hesterlee, director of research development for the Tucson, Ariz.-based Muscular Dystrophy Association, which helped fund the study. ""The pieces of this disease's puzzle are really beginning to fall into place. It gives us a much better idea of what to target for therapies.""  Hesterlee said Cooper's work is consistent with research published in another journal last month also supporting the theory that RNA blockages are causing most of the symptoms of myotonic dystrophy.  Cooper said the next step for researchers, having identified RNA as the culprit, is to understand precisely why the excess RNA is botching efforts by the body's cells to produce the correct proteins allowing muscles to act as they should. That will provide more effective, targeted therapies, he said.

2022-04-22 06:04:30+00:00,true,5,"  New Peaking Rate for SoCalGas Could Spur Bypass  After various fits and starts surrounding the issue over a number of months, California regulators Thursday established an alternative demand stand-by charge, called a ""peaking rate,"" for Southern California Gas Co., which could open up the utility to ""economic bypass"" by interstate pipeline projects lined up and ready to go at the border. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) rejected the utility's own proposal as ""anti-competitive.""  ""This case has been very contentious,"" said the lead commissioner assigned to the case, Richard Bilas. ""For the most part, the response to SoCal's application was negative."" Noting active opposition from large end-users, merchant generators and interstate pipelines, Bilas said that it is difficult to find an ideal peaking rate for gas. CPUC President Loretta Lynch dropped an alternate proposal to support Bilas.  Ideally, the regulators are trying to keep the utility and its captive customers whole, while not deterring the option of what they call ""economic bypass,"" said Bilas, noting that SoCalGas' proposals did not ""reflect market reality. The new rate calculation is very complex, and potential competitors have yet to comment on its impact.  A number of proposed interstate pipelines are lined up at the border awaiting a decision which would make it economic for them to proceed into SoCalGas territory, including an expansion of Mojave to Sacramento, Questar Corp.'s proposed Southern Trails oil-to-natural gas converted pipeline from the Four Corners area to Long Beach, and Kinder Morgan and Calpine's Sonoran pipe to San Francisco. Up to this point the utility's residual load service (RLS) charges -- which customers of other pipelines had to pay in addition to charges paid to the transporting pipelines -- made it uneconomic to sign up on other lines. Called on by the CPUC to come in with a more moderate system, SoCalGas had proposed replacing the RLS charge with a peaking charge that customers said was just as onerous.  The CPUC made its decision on a revised peaking charge unanimously on a 4-0 vote, with one of the five-member body's commissioners absent.  The CPUC action establishes a peaking rate for SoCalGas customers who want to take only partial service from the utility and get their baseload service from another pipeline. Customers will be required to pay a monthly demand charge, public goods charge collected on a volumetric basis (so if there is no use, there is no charge), a reservation charge with a complex formula, and an interruptible peaking rate for volumes actually received.  Peaking customers will be subject to daily balancing and a credit for service interruptions of firm capacity, which will apply to both new and existing facilities.  ""The new rate contrasts to the rate design in place for SoCalGas' standard full-requirements firm-load customers who pay for priority on a volumetric basis,"" Lynch said. ""We're changing the peaking rates so that customers not taking their full service from the utility will only pay for the amount of capacity they use on any given day.  ""The challenge for the CPUC in this case was to establish a peaking tariff for natural gas service that fairly compensates SoCalGas for standing ready to serve the peak needs only of some customers, while those customers go off its system for their baseload needs, but also to develop a tariff that allows SoCalGas to be able to compete with some of the energy company pipelines that plan to enter into SoCal's service territory.  ""We're trying to encourage and promote additional natural gas resources without encouraging cherry picking or overbuilding for which core customers would end up paying for,"" Lynch added.

2022-04-22 09:48:20+00:00,true,5,"  Pipe Expansions Planned for Rockies Region  With several pipeline companies well into addressing the pipeline capacity shortages that persist as natural gas production grows throughout the Rocky Mountain region, Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission LLC (KMIGT) announced two major projects Wednesday, and several other companies detailed expansions planned or in the works during the closing session at the 13th Annual Rocky Mountain Natural Gas Strategy Conference.  Headlining the news was KMIGT's plans to use existing rights-of-way to build the Advantage Pipeline, which would fill the same needs as the Colorado Interstate Gas pipe, moving from the Cheyenne Hub to the Mid-Continent. An open season is scheduled on the proposed pipe this fall.  Dave Scharf, business development director for KMIGT, said the 24-inch pipe, which would move gas primarily from the Powder River Basin, would have a capacity of 330 MMcf/d, delivering to interconnects on its way to the Kansas City markets.  ""It would have a smaller size, with about 40% less content,"" Scharf said, but it would be expandable to 450 MMcf/d, with access to liquid Mid-Continent pipes, local distribution centers and end-use markets.  A smaller pipeline, NECO -- a 12-inch pipe, about 95 miles long -- would serve the northeastern Colorado market. Although small, Scharf emphasized that it would reduce some of the bottlenecks now evident in moving gas in that part of the state, and would also allow backhauls to Cheyenne. An open season on this line is also scheduled this fall, Scharf said.  KMIGT also is planning to expand its storage capacity in the Rockies, adding more horsepower at the Cheyenne Hub and Huntsman facility. The Huntsman would be expanded to deliver 75 MMcf/d, with delivery at Cheyenne of 45 MMcf/d.  ""We want to customize shippers' needs,"" Scharf said of the expansion. Noting there were synergies between the three projects, he said KMIGT was on a growth plan that would use both acquisitions and expansion. ""Rocky Mountain growth opportunities we see are in Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas and Nebraska,"" he said.  El Paso's Craig Coombs, who directs project development for the company's Western Pipeline Group, said El Paso also is expanding its pipelines east from the Rockies, with a Cheyenne to Mid-Continent connection, spending $380 million to add 540 MDth/d. The open season for this expansion ended July 20, said Coombs, and he said El Paso is now negotiating with shippers. A FERC filing is scheduled for December 2001, with an in-service date in late 2003 or early 2004.  Coombs also updated attendees on the CIG expansion along the Front Range of the Rockies, which he said is on track to be in service by mid-2004. Over the next four years, Coombs said supply from the Rockies would grow from 5 Bcf/d to 7.5 Bcf/d, and warned there would be ""blood on the streets"" if pipeline systems are not expanded.  Coombs said El Paso planned to file its request with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in January 2002 for its Ruby pipeline, which is scheduled to carry 250 MDth/d from the Rockies into Nevada and 500 MDth/d into California. The Ruby project, said Coombs, ""is designed with power plants in mind."" The pipeline will be 30-36-inches with 40,000 horsepower.  El Paso's Western Frontier pipeline project, which also closed its open season in July, is also is on schedule, with a FERC filing by the fourth quarter of this year and an in-service target date by November 2003.  ""What's driving all of these expansions are the power plant projects,"" Coombs said. With more than 9,200 MW proposed in the region in the coming years, he said capacity would rise more than 2 Bcf/d by 2010. Noting that every planned expansion might not come to fruition because of competing proposals, Coombs said that there is ""still tremendous growth"" in the Rockies.  Shelley Wright, supervisor of capacity marketing for Questar Pipeline Co., detailed the many projects her company has under way in the Rockies, including its Main Line 104, the Clay Basin Projects, the Southern Trails pipe to California and its work on the Eakin compressors.  The Main Line 104, a joint venture with El Paso's CIG, will move new and existing gas supplies to the Wasatch Front and other connecting pipes. It is expected to be in service in November 2001, and is on schedule and moving forward, Wright said. She also noted that the Clay Basin, which is the largest storage facility in the western United States, was already ahead of schedule for 2001-2002 storage.  ""We're seeing more interest in getting storage filled this year"" than last, Wright said, noting that storage was depleted last winter. The Clay Basin facility will undergo testing tentatively in April 2002, which ""may result in additional firm capacity."" Wright said there had been ""a lot of interest in additional storage capacity,"" and Questar will know more next year as to whether it will expand the facility.

2022-04-22 21:38:31+00:00,true,5,"  Summary  Though this conference was scheduled to review all issues related to El Paso's capacity allocation method (including those in the pipeline's Order 637 proceeding), and with two complaints filed this summer regarding problems with the pipeline's allocation, major substantive issues were not covered at this conference.  For instance, the battle between Full Requirements (FR) shippers and Contract Demand (CD) shippers came up marginally, but not in terms as substantive as the proposed conversion of FR shippers to CD contracts.  Procedurally, there was also no decision on whether to proceed with a hearing, merits decision from the Commission or settlement, though it looks like a merits decision is the likely avenue for a decision.  Staff did not discuss case merits or ask pointed substantive questions.  Allocation Studies (Models)  El Paso opened the conference with a presentation/interpretation of seven capacity studies they have done to illustrate how its allocation proposal (March 27) would allocate the system's receipt and delivery points based on different scenarios.  For nominations, receipt and delivery points were specified and ranked by shippers, and the model used 20 pools.  The scheduling model looked at where constraints occurred (based on those shipper-supplied preferences), solved the largest constraints first, then ran second and third iterations to complete allocation.  There were questions on the studies, what they show, what the assumptions are, etc., and in the end shippers believe they need information not shown by the completed studies.  Shippers have requested six more allocation studies, showing possible impacts of seasonalization (winter and summer) and the difference between CD and Full Requirements Coincidental and Non Coincidental Peaks (winter and summer, 1995 - 2000).    El Paso interprets its studies as showing that the proposed capacity allocation method is workable, and in fact results in 247 MMcf/d of unallocated capacity (230 MMcf coming from the Line 2000 expansion proposal, and an extra 17 MMcf).  Shippers were skeptical of the ""slack capacity"" finding.  Other Issues  ? Pooling: There was a small amount of discussion on the impact of moving from six to 20 pools.  It was noted that this should be addressed with Order 637 issues, expeditiously after capacity allocation method is resolved.  ? FR vs. CD: Though there were some FR vs. CD shippers discussions, they did not reflect the battle we see going on in the two complaints filed this summer by the TX, NM and AZ shippers (FR) and Aera Energy (CD shippers).  There was also no mention of converting FR shippers to CD service.  Note: never mentioned were the CD and FR complainants' proposals that El Paso (1) dedicate currently proposed expansions to existing shippers or (2) requiring mainline system expansion for existing service (RP01-484 and 486).  ? Release shippers:  Shippers contracting for released capacity were concerned about how they would be allocated, as well as those shippers picking up turnback contracts from the pipeline (which would have receipt and delivery points already allocated).  ? Receipt Point Designation:  The question was asked if shippers could designate specific receipt points rather than pools.  When asked what Commission policy is on pools vs. receipt points, both shippers and Staff clarified that they are neither mutually exclusive nor to serve as substitutes for one another - both should be available.  However, Staff noted that in the flexibility vs. reliability debate, it could be argued that El Paso should return to receipt point designation to maintain reliability.   Procedure Going Forward  The primary issue here ended up being procedural.  The procedural schedule is as follows: ? El Paso further studies and answers to questions posed at conference or in writing:   Sept. 24 ? Initial comments (on all capacity allocation issues and procedural recommendations): Oct. 15 ? Reply comments:  Oct. 26 ","Summary Though this conference was scheduled to review all issues related to El Paso's capacity allocation method (including those in the pipeline's Order 637 proceeding), and with two complaints filed this summer regarding problems with the pipeline's allocation, major substantive issues were not covered at this conference.

There are some differences in the final order as opposed to the proposed decision previously issued such as the addition of an interruptible rate.  In summary the Order contains the following provisions:  1.  Two rates were adopted.  A firm cost-based peaking rate and an interruptible peaking rate.  2.  The firm cost-based peaking rate will include the following components:  a.  A monthly customer charge to collect the cost of customer-related facilities.    Actual rate will be dependent on type of customer ranging from $800 to $19,000.  b.  A volumetric Public Purpose Program surcharge based on Commission approved rates.  c.  A monthly reservation rate calculated using the currently authorized end-use customer class rate times the MDQ.    3.  The interruptible peaking rate has been set at 150% of SoCalGas' default tariff rate at a 100% load factor.  4.  Firm and inter. customers will pay a volumetric rate to collect the Interstate Transition Cost Surcharge, Sempra-wide rate charge      and any other similar types of surcharges.  5.  Other provisions include: customers are subject to daily balancing, interruptible customers are not eligible for Service Interruption      Credits and the tariff will apply on a facility-by-facility basis.  SoCal was ordered to submit modified cost-based tariff sheets within 10 days of the order (Due 8/12/01).

2022-04-22 12:51:48+00:00,true,5,"  Kevin,   I'm sorry, Kevin.  I didn't realize the report was that long!  Here is a little synopsis.  I hope this helps you.  I haven't had time to read the report yet, but if I see a better summary come out, I'll send it your way.  Lorna  CEC Blames Overtaxed In-State Gas System for High Prices  Confirming what the state's energy crisis made abundantly clear months ago, the California Energy Commission (CEC) staff last week released its final draft report on the state's natural gas infrastructure, concluding that it is constrained and has caused higher-than-average wholesale gas prices, particularly in the southern half of the state. But the report did not totally rule out market manipulation as a culprit.  It concludes that a combination of infrastructure shortcomings and possible market manipulation has to the higher natural gas prices in California. ""Market participants may have manipulated prices even higher than justified by existing infrastructure bottlenecks, but it is the inability of gas customers to rely on competition between gas suppliers that contributed to higher prices in California,"" the report stated.  Among a half dozen recommended steps the state can take to help bolster initiatives already under way by utilities and merchant energy suppliers, said the CEC report, which will go to the five-member commission for approval Aug. 22. It stressed encouraging the development of more ""independent"" gas storage facilities, and taking steps to more fully ""optimize"" storage, including an increase in its use by large end-users.  As a backdrop to the study's conclusions, the CEC report noted that both upgrades of in-state infrastructure and interstate pipeline capacity are needed to meet ""growing demand in California and throughout the West."" If the current proposed interstate pipeline expansions don't come online as scheduled, the CEC report said other state actions would be necessary, although it did not spell out what those might be.  For the future, the report said that the CEC will track more closely storage levels and natural gas prices because they are ""key indicators"" of how extensive problems might be at any given time in the state's natural gas infrastructure.  The other steps recommended for action are: 1) encouraging more in-state natural gas production (the state legislature already has proposed a new law to provide incentives); 2) setting new ""design criteria and reliability standards"" for the state's gas system to reflect what the CEC calls ""the changing nature of natural gas demand, especially for electric generators;"" 3) establishing integrated planning of the state's pipeline and storage facilities; and 4) developing a ""natural gas curtailment scheme"" emphasizing efficiency and optimizing gas use in times of shortages.  The 111-page report, ""Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues,"" prepared by the CEC Electricity and Natural Gas Committee for final adoption of the five-member politically appointed commission, assessed the state gas industry from the perspective of supply, pipeline capacity (both inter- and intrastate) and storage, with the added elements of the recent historically severe drought in the Pacific Northwest and the in-state pipeline constraints at the California-Arizona border.  As part of the proposed implementation, the report recommends that the CEC work more closely with the California Public Utilities Commission to develop a new curtailment policy that is ""fair and at the same time promotes the efficient use of natural gas"" during shortage periods. It also proposes that the CEC this fall conduct a workshop to determine ways to have non-core, large energy-intensive customers better optimize their use of natural gas storage.

2022-04-22 08:29:05+00:00,true,6,"  paperloop.com SINGAPORE, Aug. 7, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Chinese pulp traders who have stockpiled northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) and radiata pine pulp are facing pressure following price slides for these grades. In early August, a major Latin American supplier slashed its radiata pine list price for Chinese buyers by $40/tonne. The move stunned the well-stocked traders, who may have to sell off their volumes at prices lower than they paid for them.  But in the hardwood sector, certain suppliers and traders are expecting prices to bounce back and creep up by $10-20/tonne in September, although some say the chances of this happening are low. One Canadian supplier, who pointed toward a rash of pulp downtime taken by his fellow countrymen, reported that softwood prices have hit rock bottom. ""All of this downtime is related to low prices that they cannot compete with,"" he said. He indicated that softwood pricing has begun to stabilize, but does not foresee any price improvements before the end of September. The hardwood pulp market's immediate future seems brighter. Suppliers reported that Korean buyers have taken large volumes of Brazilian eucalyptus in June and July to build up inventories at low prices. But Korea's overall buying activity reached just 70 percent of its normal level in these two months. The country's weak paper and board market and sagging exports drove Korea's major paper producers to take five days of downtime in July. In China, Brazilian eucalyptus which is competitively priced continues to have the edge over Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood pulp. Many paper mills have switched to Brazilian eucalyptus from Indonesian hardwood as the price differential between the two grades has narrowed to around $10/tonne from the traditional gap of $60/tonne.  Another hardwood grade which saw demand pick up was bleached chemi-thermomechanical pulp (BCTMP). Traders reported that consumption of the grade has been growing fast in China, although prices remained unchanged from mid-July. Softwood sees price slides NBSK prices have dropped $10/tonne for regular Asian buyers. Spot prices in China and Korea are also down $10/tonne. Russian bleached softwood pulp prices in China stayed flat with consumption steady. Radiata pine prices have slipped $20/tonne for regular buyers and $10-20/tonne in China and Korea for spot business. Southern pine prices are unchanged in China, Japan and Korea, but trading is minimal. Unbleached softwood kraft pulp prices are steady throughout Asia.  Hardwood prices stabilize Brazilian eucalyptus prices remain unchanged for regular buyers. But spot prices in China and Korea have edged up slightly. Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood prices also inched up by $10/tonne at the bottom of the price range across Asia, but trading has been declining. Northern mixed hardwood prices remain unchanged in Japan and Korea, while southern mixed hardwood prices are stable across Asia. BCTMP prices are also flat for regular buyers and for spot business in China and Korea.

2022-04-22 02:29:38+00:00,true,6,"  paperloop.com SAN FRANCISCO, July 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Various major market pulp producers have further increased their downtime plans -- scheduling an estimated 767,402 tonnes during the third quarter -- in a more aggressive attempt to bring inventories in line with expected demand.  Many of the supply curtailments are taking place during the summer as producers anticipate continued weak pricing.  The 767,402 tonnes producers are taking this quarter represent the most downtime producers have taken in the past fiscal year, and already has eclipsed the estimated 655,132 tonnes producers took in the second quarter. The total also dwarfed the 383,000 tonnes taken in the first quarter, when cold weather prevented some producers from shutting operations, and has surpassed the 512,000 tonnes taken in fourth-quarter 2000, when several producers combined maintenance and market-related shuts. Current downtime is primarily market related, say industry sources.  Tembec, Inc., which has about 426,000 tonnes of yearly northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) capacity, will lose about 20,119 tonnes from its NBSK mill in Skookumchuck, B.C., while its other NBSK mill, in Smooth Rock Falls, Ont., will trim about 16,926 tonnes based on c capacity of 191,000 tonnes/yr. Tembec's NBSK downtime alone will total 37,405 tonnes, representing more than a third of the 100,000 tonnes of 3Q downtime it has planned. The remaining 62,595 tonnes will come from its various bleached chemi-thermomechanical (BCTMP) mills and some specialty sulfite pulps.  A source at Parsons & Whittemore today said the Rye Brook, N.Y., firm would shutter its northern bleached hardwood kraft (NBHK) mill in Nackawick, N.B., from Aug. 20 to Sept. 8. The mill, which has capacity to produce 260,000 tonnes/yr, will curb about 14,060 tonnes from its supplies. All of the downtime is market-related, said the source.  Meanwhile, International Paper Co. said during a conference call last week that its third-quarter pulp curtailments would total about 80,000 tonnes, equaling the downtime it had taken in the second quarter. That downtime is in addition to huge cutbacks of a combined 147,000 tonnes per quarter it has taken since shutting down its integrated pulp mills in Mobile, Ala., and Camden, Ark.  Canfor Corp. last week said it would close its Northwood mill in Prince George, B.C., from July 27-Aug. 6 and lose about 19,000 tonnes of NBSK. A company source said the mill would again close in September, with its two pulp lines shut for about 10 days each, losing another 15,000 tonnes and bringing the company's third-quarter NBSK downtime to 34,000 tonnes, according to the source.  Valois Vision Marketing reported last week that UPM-Kymmene has taken about 12,000 tonnes of NBSK from supplies at its Miramichi, N.B., mill in July. Further third-quarter downtime plans at the firm were not available.  ""Look at the prices, I'm surprised there isn't more downtime,"" said Managing Director Michel Valois, who expected that paper downtime would continue at a high rate. That could fuel additional market pulp downtime moving forward, he noted.

2022-04-22 12:15:46+00:00,false,6,"  paperloop.com BRUSSELS, Aug. 10, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Europe is no longer the happy hunting ground it was for spot deal makers. With a weak Euro and rock bottom prices for regular business, there is little room for undercutting without sinking below production costs. North American suppliers of spot hardwood tonnes have gradually disappeared from the European scene since the beginning of July. Their home market is a more lucrative place in present conditions. Canadian producers are already selling pulp at below full costs of production and suppliers from other parts of the world are coming up against the same predicament. Eucalyptus, as one buyer in Germany put it, ""doesn't really exist on the spot market any more."" There is still some softwood around for those who seek spot tonnage. But the downtime which pulp mills have been forced to take, allied to the fact that there is precious little difference between the spot deals and the price for regular business, means buyers are more likely to be pestered by their regular suppliers to take their normal quota than by hawkers of spot tonnes out to do a deal. What little Canadian NBSK that is available on the European spot market is priced at around $400/tonne. This is rather more than the Scandinavian equivalent, which has arrived on the market thanks to the over-production which June's Norscan figures revealed. Much of this pulp, which is available at some $20-30/tonne cheaper than Canadian NBSK, has found its way to Asia and the Middle East to compete for Government tenders. The availability of spot tonnes from Scandinavian producers could frustrate regular European buyers who need no extra tonnes and would have to break contracts to take advantage of this cheaper surplus. Reports of much stronger buying activity in Asia also explain a shift in spot pulp supply away from Europe. But this could be tempered marginally by a fall in the price of radiata pine pulp supplied to the region by Latin American producers. The Pulpex August 2001 NBSK contract closed up $10.25 last week at $407.5 DDU net. Pulpex is not an exact mirror of the spot market but has proved a useful barometer and this rise suggests that there is at least little more downward pressure on spot prices. Spot prices in Europe during the week ending August 10 were: NBSK $370 - 400/tonne, eucalyptus $330 -340/tonne.

While EPA's review includes long-term options like complete legislative overhaul of the Clean Air Act, it is likely that it will consider many of the more short term options available to it under existing regulatory/administrative authority.   In the process of developing its recommendations, EPA published a ""Background Paper"" and opened a docket soliciting public comment on a broad range of issues pertaining to NSR.  EPA has also held public hearings and numerous stakeholder meetings.  Enron participated in stakeholder meetings, and also submitted written comments -- as part of several organizations (EPSA, Clean Power Group, INGAA) and individually.    The attached Enron comments, submitted last Friday, July 27,  reflect input from numerous commercial sources.  NSR impacts a number of commercial interests, including:   development, siting and finance of new power plants; origination activities with customers seeking to upgrade, expand or modify power facilities; trading/risk management for power, gas, coal, emissions allowances; finance/deployment of emissions control technologies; industrial markets such as forest products, steel, refining/chemicals power generation and natural gas pipeline operations  We will continue to have opportunities to provide input into the process through EPA and the Administration, and would welcome further comments or examples of impact on our businesses.

2022-04-22 09:17:03+00:00,false,6,"  paperloop.com SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 8, 2001 (paperloop.com) - North American printing and writing paper production dropped 301,000 tonnes in June compared with production for June of 2000, and producers operated at just 84 percent of capacity for June, according to the Pulp and Paper Products Council (PPPC). Along with the decreased production compared with last year, overall printing and writing paper inventories decreased by 68,000 tonnes in June from May's level, and was down 152,000 tonnes compared with the June 2000 inventory total. Most of that stock decline was at uncoated free-sheet mills, primarily due to downtime. Coated free-sheet paper inventories remained relatively unaffected, dropping only 4,000 tonnes in June. Total coated free-sheet demand plummeted 21 percent in June compared with year-ago results. Less downtime in June. While overall printing and writing paper operating rates were down to 84 percent in June in North America, less downtime was taken in June compared with May, when printing and writing papers' operating rate was only 79 percent. The increased production in June was dependent upon an anticipated swell in demand. Production of lightweight coated (LWC) and coated groundwood usually pick up in the third quarter with demand from the catalog market. In addition, the seasonal swell in demand for uncoated free-sheet (especially reprographic paper for school and office use) begins in August, when large accounts begin their bids.  The decrease in production of coated free-sheet and coated groundwood paper has helped save North American manufacturers in a weak market. But overall lack of domestic demand, a strong U.S. dollar impeding export, and less expensive imported coated papers has contributed to the sliding prices of coated papers in the U.S. since April. With magazine subscriptions low and magazine pages down by 20 percent largely due to a decrease in advertising, the coated paper producers said they hope that the start of the holiday catalog season will stimulate sales. Import competition. According to the PPPC, overseas imports of coated groundwood to North America dipped 13 percent when compared with June 2000 imports. Even though quantity has fallen, domestic manufacturers are having a hard time competing with less expensive Asian and European coated paper. Uncoated free-sheet witnessed a rush of overseas imports in June, up 67.1 percent compared with June 2000. Overall, however, uncoated free-sheet shipments to the U.S. and Canada fell 74,000 tonnes (6 percent) compared with June 2000 shipments.  The U.S. was aggressively exporting coated free-sheet to Canada through May this year. The U.S. shipped 128,900 tons in the first five months to Canada, up from 92,500 tons in the first five months of 2000, according to AF&PA.  Inventory decline. Total inventories of printing and writing papers are tightening. Coated inventories remain high, however. In May, coated paper and coated groundwood inventory combined was at 820,000 tonnes, just 5,000 tonnes less than the inventory in June 2000.  Inventories of uncoated free-sheet and uncoated groundwood papers slid steadily throughout the second quarter, totaling 1.682 million tonnes in June compared with 1.83 million tonnes in inventory in June 2000.  Canadian mill shipments fell as much as 16.4 percent since last June for coated groundwood, according to the PPPC. Coated free-sheet shipments from Canada also fell 10.7 percent, reflecting a very loose North American market for coated paper overall.  However, Canadian shipments of uncoated groundwood remained solid. Overall printing and writing paper shipments from Canada totaled 3.3 million tons in the first half of this year, down 4.2 percent compared with first half 2000 shipments.

In conversations with Doug Cebryk, it looks like the primary routes are Interstate 17 and El Paso's existing right of way south.  I spoke with Kevin Hyatt about a possible route that exists south to a power plant between station 1 and Kingman Az, and then heading southeast into the Phoenix area, but didnt know if the economics would work out. Ive got ENSR looking at other routes that might hold promise.  I also plan on addressing what might be considered sensitive areas of potential impact (streams, rivers, riparian habitat, difficult terrain, population and  critical habitat  issues etc)  Ill have a report to you shortly after the trip...

I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.  After we receive the ""fatal-flaw"" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should be scheduled to expedite the project as follows: 1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw analysis. 2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits).  3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources early in the process. 4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix area and for the Southwest.  I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events coordinated.

They had been called in during the previous night by the Governor's Office of Emergency Services (OES), part of the 290 engines dispatched  statewide through California's Fire and RescueMutual Aid System, coordinated by OES.   OES called in engines from as far south as San Diego and as far north as Mt. Shasta to a staging area in the city of Madera. The wildland and structure-protection engines had been trickling in since  1 a.m. to be on hand as needed. All 65 were, in fact, needed at 11 a.m., when winds picked up and sent the 4,000-acre Creek Fire in Mariposa County through its containment line.   The Creek Fire moved north at about noon, leading to evacuation orders affect 15-20 homes on Jackass Ridge Road and additional houses on Harper Road. To the north, residents of Groveland and Big Oak Flat were advised to evacuate as a precaution. To assist the four communities, the American Red Cross opened a shelter at the Coulterville Community Center in Mariposa County.   In all, OES has committed 90 of its own engines, 200 local engines (cities, counties and special fire districts) and 11 California National Guard helicopters to fight four California wildfires.  Those fires are:  ? Creek Fire in Mariposa and Tuolumne counties at 4,000 acres, 50% contained with 21 OES and local government engines. Since the fire started 5 p.m. on Saturday, it has injured 3 and threatened 3000  homes. ? Ponderosa Fire in Placer County which is 2,440 acres and 50% contained, with 80 OES and local engines. Since the fire started at 2  p.m., Friday, it has threatened 200 homes and led to at least 18 injuries. ? Leonard Fire in Calaveras County, which is 3,000 acres, 10 % contained, with 70 OES and local engines.  Since the fire started at 2:15 p.m. on Friday, no injuries, 300 homes threatened, evacuations in progress. ? Highway Fire in Fresno County which is 120 acres, 0% contained, with 10 OES and local engines. Since the fire started at 6:45 p.m. on Sunday, threatening 12 homes and six outbuildings.   OES coordinates state-level emergency preparedness, response,  recovery and mitigation for a wide range of natural and human-caused emergencies and disasters.

2022-04-22 06:19:27+00:00,true,6,"  Mark, Tom, and Holden,  In reference to the DPR impacts of $ 132,000 (WAPA) and $133,000 (SRP) that you were expecting, here is an explanation of why you will not be seeing that in your PMA's:  The 2 deals listed below were put in as a MW month, each with 3 strips in the deal separating out April 1, April 2, and the rest of the month.  The reason for the 3 strips was to catch the April 1 time change from PST to PDT.    deal #  539126: 3 strips @ 2216 = 199,500 charge for the month in CARP (true value is - $66,500). deal #  538832: 3 strips @ 2180 = 196,200 charge for the month in CARP (true value is - $65,400) .   Typically, I provide you with a report that tells you what $ amount to look for coming thru in your PMA's, according to the changes that I am making on the back end.  You then see the change in DPR come thru on a PMA report that Risk provides for you.    When these deals hit Settlements, we recognized that the CARP was calculating both deals at 3 times their monthly value (and since we are purchasing, that is a negative three times against your books).  When the above + DPR impacts didn't come thru in your PMA's, we started looking at the deals to figure out why they didn't.   Here is a discription of the Risk - Settlements process: Risk values a deal on the day of liquidation.  Any intra-month changes, even if they happen after the day of flow, get trued up by Risk and changed in the DPR.  Anything that gets changed after the end of the month, Settlements recognizes as a DPR variance and reports this to Risk and you see it affect your DPR as reported in the PMA report.  So the question was: When it came to recognizing a variance in Settlements, why weren't we seeing a + amount back to your books for 2 of the strips that I zero'd out?   Houston Settlements looked into it and were seeing that these deals were originally valued at ($66,500) and ($65,400), even though CARP was showing that they were calculating at ($199,500) and ($196,200) ....  Heather Dunton and I did alot of searching for the answer and we found that:  When Risk flashed these deals in April, they flashed them according to a single MW month charge.  Regardless of how many strips there are, the deal is set up as a MW month and should, therefore, calculate as one single charge for the month.   We found that CARP is reading these incorrectly and causing the confusion, (as I was seeing that the deals were calculating 3 times because that is how CARP and UNIFY were reading the deal).    The IT people in Houston are now working on fixing that glitch.  When it comes to DPR, your book originally recognized an impact of (66,500) and (65,400), which is correct.  Since your April DPR was correct, you will not see an adjustment in your PMA's.    I recognize that this is not gratification for the + DPR impact that you were expecting and I apologize for the confusion and mis-information that I gave you in my report.  This has, however, helped us to hi-light a technical error that will save us alot of work in the future.   Thanks for your patience while we figured this out. Let me know if you have any questions.

The fire is currently burning out of control, threatening structures  and has the potential of jumping  I - 80.    Of the four teams, two originate from Sacramento County, one from Placer County, and one from Calaveras County  Throughout Northern California and Nevada, eight fires have burned an  estimated 92,000 acres so far. In addition to the recent group of four strike teams, OES has also deployed 79 other State OES and local  government fire engines, two state-of-the-art OES satellite communication trailers, and numerous fire and telecommunications staff to the Northern California fire lines.    The local and state-owned equipment has been dispatched through California's Fire and Rescue  Mutual Aid System, administered by OES, to assist the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, U.S. Forest Service, and local departments.  The system is designed to ensure that additional resources are provided to local jurisdictions whenever their own resources are committed or insufficient for a specific fire.  Among the 99 engines deployed, 20 are State-owned OES Engines. These  engines have been provided to local departments by OES.  Under an agreement with the state, when requested by OES, fire departments are  required to dispatch the engines, including personnel, within an hour  to the scene of an emergency or disaster in California.  When not in use during a disaster, local departments may use the engines for mutual aid response for neighboring cities and counties, local multiple alarm fires, temporary replacement of out-of-service engines, for training, and for other local needs.  -OES-   For more information contact: Eric Lamoureux - (916) 262-1843  EDIS-08-13-01 1703 PDT   --------------------------------------------------------- To update or terminate your subscription to this email service visit our webpage at http://www.incident.com/edismail.html.

Sources said that although buying activity is picking up, Chinese traders are keen to destock their full inventories, putting a stop to any upward moves for NBSK and radiata pine pulp prices. Spot prices for these two grades have stayed flat at $390-410/tonne and $370-390/tonne, respectively, since early July.  Mill downtime and reduced woodchip supplies have impeded trading of Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood in Asia. But a flurry of Brazilian eucalyptus to the region has filled the gap. Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood prices have edged up at the lower end to $360-370/tonne, up from $340-370/tonne in mid-July. Brazilian eucalyptus prices also shifted up $10/tonne at the lower end of the range, taking prices to US$360-370/tonne. Sources reported that large volumes of pulp from Latin America were being shipped to China in July following orders placed earlier. These include Brazilian eucalyptus and radiata pine from Chile.

There were several IT teams (your local IT Support as well as Houston based Web and Network teams) that worked together to troubleshoot the audio and video feeds while watching the performance of your sites communication links with Houston to ensure your trading business was not compromised. I would like to provide you some history as well as go forward actions to provide better audio/video streaming services.  You may have noticed that the medium for viewing the meeting has changed from the previous IPTV application to a web based application. This new medium has been in the development stages with the production target of October 2001 which was set by business. Last Friday business approached IT infrastructure and advised that there would be an All Employee Meeting on Aug, 16 (today). This didn't provide much time for preparation and testing. During the troubleshooting for each of your sites, the Network team (Scott Shishido and George Nguyen) were able to determine some but not all causes to the poor performance. I will be meeting with the Web (Edward Ray) and Network (Steve Hardy and Scott Shishido) teams to determine what the action plan is for resolving the performance issues.  My understanding is that the meeting will be available for viewing if you wish to do so. I will be communicating to you when your site will be able to view this replay of the All Employee Meeting.

2022-04-22 04:12:50+00:00,true,6,"  paperloop.com HELSINKI, July 30 (Reuters) - Production of paper and board at mills in Finland fell two percent year-on-year in the first half of 2001 to 6.37 million tonnes, reflecting the global economic slowdown, the industry said on Monday. Finland is the world's second biggest exporter of forest products after Canada. ""In Finland, the forest industry's production in the second quarter of the year was about five percent less than in the first quarter,"" the Finnish Forest Industries Federation said in a statement. Production rose in the mechanical wood industry, but fell in the pulp and paper industry, according to the trade association.  Production curtailments in the second quarter knocked average paper and board mill operating rates in Finland down to 86 percent from 93 percent in the first quarter, it said. Paper and board output in the second quarter fell by 377,000 tonnes, or by about 11 percent versus the first quarter, according to the federation. ""The production of all paper grades fell in the second quarter, the decrease was most noticeable in fine paper production,"" the federation added. Pulp production at Finnish mills fell 1.1 percent year-on-year in the first half to 5.62 million tonnes, but pulp output rose two percent in the second quarter on the same period a year ago, the federation said. Finnish-Swedish Stora Enso, the world's number two papermaker, last week posted a sharp drop in second-quarter profits due to massive production cuts in the face of weak demand and said the market would remain difficult this year. Finnish fine paper group, M-real, and tissue producer, Metsa Tissue, are scheduled to report second-quarter results on Wednesday, with the world's third-biggest papermaker, UPM-Kymmene due to post results on Thursday.

2022-04-22 23:14:54+00:00,true,6,"  Larry,  Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.  After we receive the ""fatal-flaw"" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should be scheduled to expedite the project as follows: 1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw analysis. 2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits).  3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources early in the process. 4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix area and for the Southwest.  I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events coordinated.

2022-04-22 12:55:57+00:00,true,6,"  paperloop.com HELSINKI, Aug 14, 2001 (Reuters) _ Producers' pulp stocks in Finland, Sweden, the United States and Canada rose 4,000 tonnes to just over 1.78 million tonnes in July, increasing less than the long_term average for the month, a Finnish industry official said on Tuesday.  Stocks of market pulp in the North American and Scandinavian (Norscan) countries rose in three out of the four producer countries, but a 36,000 tonne drop in Canadian stocks to 790,000 tonnes helped keep the end_July level almost flat on end_June.  ""Inventories were practically unchanged,"" said Mikko Tahvanainen of the Finnish Forest Industries Federation. ""Things went better than expected.""  The 10_year average increase for July is between 150,000 and 160,000 tonnes he said.  Market pulp stocks are an indicator of future trends in prices of the key raw material, which in turn affect paper prices. High pulp inventories indicate downward pressure and low stocks upside for prices.  Persistently high stocks and low demand this year have put pulp prices under pressure, and the benchmark price for northern bleached softwood pulp has fallen 36 percent this year to below $460 per tonne.  Pulp stocks in Finland rose 15,000 tonnes by the end of July from end_June to 100,000 tonnes, while Swedish pulp inventories rose 13,000 tonnes to 380,000 tonnes, Tahvanainen said.  U.S. producers' pulp stocks rose 12,000 tonnes in July to 514,000 tonnes, he said.  The end_July stocks level of 1,784,000 tonnes amounted to 27 days' of output, unchanged on June, he said.  Norscan producers' pulp shipments rose by 5,000 tonnes in July to 1,742,000 tonnes, he said.  Earlier on Tuesday, the world's biggest market pulp producer, Sodra of Sweden, posted a 53 percent drop in first_half profits to 443 million Swedish crowns ($43.11 million) due to weak pulp prices but said it saw prices bottoming out.  But Sodra also said the global economic slowdown would also reduce demand in the second half of the year, which could involve continued capacity curtailments in the paper and pulp industry during the autumn.

2022-04-22 04:53:59+00:00,true,6,"  Utility Pushes Panel for Rate Hike in Utah   By Steven Oberbec, The Salt Lake Tribune -- July 31  PacifiCorp Chief Executive Judith Johansen on Monday told the Utah Public Service Commission (PSC) her company was devastated by the Western power crisis last year and needs a $118 million rate hike in Utah to help it return to financial health.    Utah Power's parent company requested the rate increase in January and the PSC will hold hearings through Friday to consider the company's request.  PacifiCorp wants the $118 million -- about $7 per month for an average Utah customer -- to cover the millions it spent last year to buy electricity on the wholesale market. The power was needed to meet its Utah customers' demand during peak usage periods.  Johansen said PacifiCorp's power costs are almost double what it is allowed to charge its customers under existing rates. Without the increase, the company's credit rating may suffer.  Credit-rating companies such as Moody's and Standard & Poors ""have a very keen eye"" on PacifiCorp rate cases in Utah and other Western states because they are concerned about the company's cash flow and overall liquidity, she said.  A decrease in PacifiCorp's credit rating could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to finance new power plant construction needed to meet the growing demand for electricity in its operating territory.  Yet throughout most of the past decade, PacifiCorp generated more power than it needed to serve its residential customers. It sold the excess electricity under long-term wholesale contracts.  Those long-term contracts benefited the company's customers to the tune of $1.3 billion over the past decade, said Stanley Watters, managing director of wholesale energy services at PacifiCorp.  Critics, however, contend the company at the same time adopted a business strategy to increase its wholesale power business and entered into long-term power supply contracts while relying on the spot market for the electricity.  The strategy worked until the spot-market price for electricity soared last summer when PacifiCorp suddenly got caught in the squeeze.  The question of who should pick up the tab for the company's wholesale power strategy lies at the heart of the rate case now before the PSC.  ""Their [wholesale] business strategy exposed ratepayers to enormous risk,"" said Dan Gimble, who serves on the staff of the Committee of Consumer Services that represents residential energy users and small businesses in utility rate cases.  PacifiCorp, though, contends it wholesale market strategy was prudent and benefitted its retail customers by helping lower the cost of a kilowatt-hour of electricity 30 percent from 1985 to 1999.  ""Absent the high market prices we've seen, I don't think any of us would be here today,"" Watters said.  Utah Power's customers will be able to tell the PSC what they think of the company's rate hike request at 5 p.m. Wednesday.

2022-04-22 04:57:13+00:00,true,6,"  Kim,  We spoke last week about a possible 5 yr gas deal for our Yuba City plant. Below is our RFP.  I'll call to discuss.  Thanks, Paul Cummins 916-996-2291 cell 916-447-5171 work  Request for Proposal (""RFP"") Yuba City Cogeneration Partners, LP 650 Bercut Drive, Suite C Sacramento, CA  95814   Background.  Yuba City Cogeneration Partners, LP (""YCC"") is the owner of a 49 megawatt cogeneration facility (""Facility"") in Yuba City, California.  YCC sells its 49 megawatts to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (""PG&E""), an entity that recently filed for bankruptcy protection.  YCC recently entered into a five-year, fixed-price electricity agreement with PG&E, and YCC desires to enter into a long-term Natural Gas Supply Agreement (""NGSA"") with an appropriate supplier (""Seller"") of natural gas.  The NGSA shall be subject to approval of the YCC project lenders, and YCC will only be able to enter into the NGSA after bankruptcy court approval of the five-year, fixed-price electricity agreement with PG&E. As a result, YCC will require a daily update to proposals it receives (to account for varying market conditions) until it receives all necessary approvals to enter into a final NGSA.  Term. The term sheet contemplates either a three-year natural gas supply agreement or a five-year natural gas supply agreement.  Under either term, the starting date will be tentatively August 1, 2001, subject to the necessary approvals.  Point(s) of Delivery.  PG&E City Gate.  Annual Volumes.  For the purposes of this RFP, it is assumed that the Facility will consume monthly and annual gas volumes under one of three different operating scenarios:      Scenario        Annual Volume, mmBtu         1                1,210,000   The typical, historical daily usage at the Facility has been 6,000 mmBtu/day, except periods of maintenance or reduction by the Facility due to the satisfaction of capacity requirements under its power purchase agreement (""PPA"") with PG&E, and the typical, monthly historical usage has been based upon a Monday through Friday operation.  Scenario 1 is indicative of plant operations for the satisfaction of the minimum requirements of the PPA, essentially 80%.  YCC would prefer a NGSA that is based upon annual volumes in a rolling 12-month period.  Monthly Balancing.  Monthly balancing on the PG&E system shall be the Seller's responsibility, subject to the limitations of the YCC's natural gas transportation agreement with PG&E, and subject to the PG&E gas system rules and tariffs.  Seller shall be responsible for any gas imbalance charges incurred on the PG&E System.  Usage Estimates.  For the purpose of assisting Seller in the Nomination process, YCC shall make usage estimates in advance and as usage occurs. Seller should specify requested frequency of usage estimates.  Monthly True-Up.  Actual usage at the Facility will almost certainly be of some variance to the forecasted monthly gas volumes.  Seller shall propose a means of ""true-ing up"" the actual usage to the forecasted monthly volumes. The ideal system of true-ing up would allow for flexibility to both YCC and Seller (""the Parties"") under the following minimum circumstances:  1. True-up of variance between forecasted usage and actual, if any.  2. If gas price volatility has created daily or other market pricing that creates financial incentive to the Parties to curtail deliveries to the Facility and remarket the natural gas to the spot or other market.  3. Allowance for the Facility to curtail deliveries for planned or unplanned maintenance.  Monthly true-up may incorporate resolution of the differences between price and volume.  Day of Nomination.  The date of Nomination of daily gas volumes by the Seller to the PG&E City Gate shall be at the option of, and as determined by Seller, subject to the limitations of YCC's natural gas transportation agreement with PG&E, and subject to the PG&E gas system rules and tariffs.  Maximum Daily Nomination Quantity:  YCC's natural gas transportation agreement with PG&E allows for a maximum daily nomination quantity of 9,550 MMbtu/Day.  Price.  YCC seeks a NGSA that will provide a physical price hedge via three alternative strategies.  The strategies are as follows:  Strategy        Price Hedge         1            Fixed price for the term.        2            Floating price, with a not-to-exceed cap.        3            Floating price, with a minimum and maximum price.  YCC acknowledges that other hedging strategies exist and may be advisable for the NGSA.  The Seller is encouraged to supply a proposal that incorporates other strategies.  Credit and Payment Terms.  YCC can offer the following credit and payment mechanisms for the purpose of removing credit and payment concern from the Seller:  1. Semi-Monthly Payment. Semi-Monthly payment for gas based on expected consumption over the first fifteen (15) calendar-day period of each month, and the expected consumption over the balance of each month via a wire from YCC to be made one day following the receipt of payments for electrical energy from PG&E.  2. Priority payment.  YCC has an agreement with its lender that costs of fuel shall have first priority in the waterfall of cash flows, i.e. the fuel supplier shall be paid from project cash flows prior to the payment of all other costs incurred, including repayment of debt, operations and maintenance costs, management fees, etc.  RFP Response may be sent via fax to Paul Cummins @ 916-447-7602.

2022-04-22 17:55:53+00:00,true,6,"  From: Governor's Office of Emergency Services  SACRAMENTO - Today, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services reports that it has pulled together the largest contingent of firefighting resources in California history since the Malibu fires of 1993.  State OES has deployed firefighters from within 51 of California's 58  counties to battle this month's wildfires (see attachment). The 1,500  firefighters make up the second largest mass of firefighters deployed  by OES to a single incident since the Southern California Fire Siege of October 1993. That month, OES called out 810 engines to battle 193,814 acres. This month, OES has called out 368 engines to battle more than 100,000 acres.  State OES pulls together local government and state fire fighting resources through the California Fire & Rescue Mutual Aid System. The  neighbor-helping-neighbor system is designed to assist the California  Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, federal wildland fire agencies, and local departments. It is also designed to ensure that additional resources are provided to local jurisdictions whenever their resources are committed or insufficient for a fire.  Today, 160 fire fighters that OES dispatched to the Ponderosa Fire in  Placer County are returning to their homes in El Dorado, Contra Costa, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, Yolo and Solano Counties.  In all, 368 local government and State OES engines deployed by OES remain on four fires along with eight California National Guard helicopters. Those fires are:  ?Creek Fire in Mariposa and Tuolumne counties at 11,565 acres, 60% contained with 211 OES and local government engines. Since the fire started 5 p.m. on Saturday it has threatened 3,000 homes.  ?North Fork in Madera County at 2,710 acres, 10% contained with 10 local government engines. Since that fire started on Monday, it has destroyed two homes, and led to evacuation orders on 210 homes.  ?Highway Fire in Fresno County (Sequoia National Forest), which is 1,275 acres, 0% contained, today, with 15 OES and local engines. Since the fire started at 6:45 p.m. on Sunday, it has destroyed three  homes, and four out buildings.   ?Leonard Fire in Calaveras County, is 3,800 acres, 30 % contained, with 90 OES and local engines. Since the fire started at 2:15 p.m. on  Friday, three structures have been destroyed: 1 home and two outbuildings. Evacuations have been ordered for numerous communities.    The OES Fire and Rescue Emergency Operations Center in Sacramento remains activated 24-hours a day to provide statewide coordination of  fire and rescue efforts.

Such characterizations are somewhat=  slanted, as they are based on information coming from environmental groups=  who oppose any NSR reform -- but there is some substantive merit behind th= ese reports as well.  NSR enforcement over plant modifications has been an extremely contentious = issue for electric utilities, and many industry sources have been lobbying = hard to relax EPA enforcement policy.  From an administrative perspective, = this is a relatively easy reform for  EPA to tackle -- it would only requir= e a change in ""guidance"" and not a lengthy regulatory process or legislatio= n.   As you can see from the attached stories, environmental groups are ext= remely opposed to this type of action, and are using the media very effecti= vely to put pressure on EPA against such loosening of NSR enforcement stand= ards. EPA will likely recommend a number of broader administrative and legislativ= e changes to NSR, most requiring a longer trip through the legislative or r= egulatory process.   Such changes could include reforms to BACT/LAER analys= is for new or existing sources, relief for cleaner sources, or standardizat= ion of some of the more arbitrary provisions of NSR.   Given the longer-ter= m effort required, these proposed reforms may be newsworthy, but less likel= y to have an impact on the power sector in the short-term.  Some of the recent complicating issues have been calls from other industry = sectors (manufacturers,  refining, industrial boilers, gas pipelines) for N= SR relief.  EPA would prefer to address power sector issues only, but may b= e politically forced to make recommendations in other sectors as well.  It = is not yet clear what sectors or what issues they will address.  Possible Outcomes/Impacts:  Large coal utilities have spent a great deal of=  resources putting pressure on the Administration on the modification & enf= orcement issues.  The issue is the easiest short-term solution to offer fro= m a regulatory standpoint, so despite environmental group opposition, it is=  likely that EPA will recommend immediate action in this area, along with l= onger-term reforms.  For Enron businesses this means that coal, emissions a= nd power trading should expect renewed strength in the coal generation sect= or, as older assets would face less barriers to extending their life.  Orig= ination opportunities (plant upgrades, capacity increases) may increase as = customers fears about enforcement actions subside.  Industrial and gas pipe= line sectors may see relief in the modification area as well, if EPA decide= s to tackle sectors outside just power.  Particularly on gas pipeline issue= s, turbine maintenance issues may be clear-cut enough for EPA to make a sim= ple , short term recommendation.  Multipollutant Legislation  Also making news lately were statements by EPA Administrator Christine Whit= man, indicating that EPA plans to release a proposal to scrap existing emis= sions regulations (NOx SIP Call/126 Rule, Regional Haze, SO2/Acid Rain) for=  a more streamlined ""multipollutant"" plan.  Multipollutant strategies have = been discussed for some time, but are becoming more newsworthy lately becau= se they were included as possible options under the Bush Energy Plan, and o= ffer potential solutions to NSR reform problems.  EPA's proposed elimination of existing air programs is not as drastic as it=  sounds -- in fact, it offers the opportunity to replace confusing, overlap= ping programs on multiple pollutants that are currently regulated or will s= oon be regulated by EPA with a more certain and flexible system.  Prospects=  for development of a multipollutant trading plan that reforms NSR are much=  less predictable, however, and will require a longer-term legislative effo= rt.  =20  In September 2001, we expect to see release of EPA's plan, as well as congr= essional consideration of several pieces of multipollutant legislation.

2022-04-22 08:32:01+00:00,true,6,"  paperloop.com BRUSSELS, Aug. 7, 2001 (paperloop.com) - UPM-Kymmene has unveiled details of the Euro 60 million ($53 million) PM 1 and pulp line rebuild at its Rauma mill in Finland. The revamp of the mill's integrated pulp line will boost mechanical pulp capacity from 1,500 tonnes/day to 1,700 tonnes/day.  The company has not yet chosen the suppliers for the scheme but expects to reach a decision by the end of October this year. UPM-Kymmene has already started planning work for the scheme and installation is due to kick off next year. The rebuilt PM 1 is scheduled to restart at the beginning of 2003. The additional pulp output is slated to come on stream during the second half of 2002.  The integrated pulp line feeds PM 1 and the mill's other three machines. The Rauma mill's pulp production has lagged behind while the PMs' capacities have risen during the past few years without major investments. The extra pulp output will enable the units to boost their paper production. The details of the pulp upgrade have not yet been hammered out, but the plans for the PM revamp have taken shape. PM 1's press and dryer sections will be modernized and the coaters will be rebuilt. The PM 1 revamp will raise the machine's high-brightness lightweight coated paper (LWC) capacity from 250,000 tonnes/yr to 300,000 tonnes/yr. The Rauma mill has a total capacity of 1,140,000 tonnes/yr of magazine paper. PM 2 produces 250,000 tonnes/yr of supercalendered (SC) paper, while PM 3's SC capacity is 240,000 tonnes/yr.

2022-04-22 14:13:35+00:00,true,6,"  From: Governor's Office of Emergency Services  State's mutual aid system allows one community to help another during  emergency  SACRAMENTO - As fire crews across California begin to contain and control numerous stubborn fires, many local government strike teams that were deployed this week through California's Fire and Rescue Mutual Aid system are returning home to their local departments.  ""Earlier this week as fires raged out of control in California, the Mutual Aid system allowed California fire departments to come together and rapidly contain the stubborn blazes,"" said Dallas Jones,  Director of the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.  ""Mutual Aid  is basically the concept of 'neighbor-helping-neighbor' deal with emergencies.""  Currently, five large fires and complexes continue burning throughout  California.  In the early hours as these blazes evolved, local fire crews quickly realized they would need additional resources and requested assistance from OES.  At OES Headquarters, staff was quickly mobilized round-the-clock to respond to the requests and deploy strike teams, in many cases, on an  ""immediate need.""  At its peak, OES deployed 26 strike teams of local  government and State OES engines, totaling more than 130 engines and an estimated 520 fire fighters   California's Fire and Rescue Mutual Aid System, administered by OES, is designed to assist the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and federal wildland fire agencies, and local departments.  The system is designed to ensure that additional resources are provided to local jurisdictions whenever their own resources are committed or insufficient for a fire.  Currently, only seven percent of the approximately 1,000 local government engines available through the mutual aid system have been used in Northern California.  Additionally, 10 percent of the State OES' 110 engines are being used on the fire lines.  State OES engines are provided to local governments for use during an  emergency or disaster. Under an agreement with the state, when requested by OES, fire departments are required to dispatch the engines, including personnel, within an hour to the scene of an emergency or disaster in California.  When not in use during a disaster, local departments may use the engines for mutual aid response, for neighboring cities and counties,  local multiple alarm fires, temporary replacement of out-of-service engines, for training, and for other local needs.  -OES-   For more information contact: Eric Lamoureux @ 262-1843  EDIS-08-16-01 1402 PDT   --------------------------------------------------------- To update or terminate your subscription to this email service visit our webpage at http://www.incident.com/edismail.html.

State OES engines will remain behind to finish what is hoped to be the final stages of this month's wildfire fight.   Today, with the fires nearing full containment, OES began sending home local government engines from the Creek and North Fork fires. Crews from the Leonard Fire will begin heading home tomorrow. The 261  engines will continue to depart the scene in parades of five, scattered throughout the next several days, passing back across the freeways to the 51 counties from which they came (see attachment).   Of the nine large wildfires that started this month, it was the Creek  Fire, currently 85 percent contained, that dominated local government  and State OES Mutual Aid resources. For six days, the Creek Fire roared across Tuolumne and Mariposa counties blackening 11,500 acres and threatening to engulf homes in numerous communities. At its peak deployment yesterday, OES had 260 engines and eight National Guard helicopters on the fires.  Among its duties, State OES dispatches local government and state fire fighting resources through the California Fire & Rescue Mutual Aid System. The neighbor-helping-neighbor system is designed to assist the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, federal wildland fire agencies, and local departments. It is also ensures that additional resources are provided to local jurisdictions  whenever their resources are committed or insufficient for a fire.

2022-04-22 10:23:04+00:00,true,6,"  BRUSSELS, Aug. 10, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Several European paper producers, together with South Africa's Sappi, have taken severe downtime in the second quarter to prevent paper and board prices from plummeting due to weak demand.  Sappi has taken massive downtime measures to battle adverse trading conditions in the coated fine paper market. The company took 150,000 tonnes of coated woodfree paper out of the European market during its third quarter ending June 30, which equals one week per month. The group's worldwide total curtailments for the period reached almost 250,000 tonnes of coated fine paper. Sappi will continue to cut capacity in its fourth quarter ending September 30, but the total tonnage may not be as high as in its third quarter.  Stora Enso has also curtailed production in an effort to try and maintain prices. The company took 558,000 tonnes of paper and board out of the European and North American markets during the second quarter. Of that, 342,000 tonnes was market-related. Stora Enso does not foresee price pressure easing over the next few months and expects further market related curtailments will be necessary. The production cuts took 61,000 tonnes of magazine paper out of North America and 75,000 tonnes out of the European market. Fine paper output was slashed by 93,000 tonnes in Europe and 63,000 tonnes in North America. Packaging board production was cut by 50,000 tonnes.  UPM-Kymmene has followed a policy of ""strict inventory management"" in order to defend prices against erosion in the face of slack demand. The company's global market related cutbacks totaled 410,000 tonnes in the first six months of this year, with 290,000 tonnes of downtime taken in the second quarter. A company spokesman would not reveal the breakdown for each grade but said, ""There is no big difference between publication paper and fine paper."" UPM-Kymmene indicated that coated groundwood prices are still under pressure and said the company will continue to wield the downtime sword if necessary.  M-real also plans to continue cutting fine paper production in the third quarter, following massive downtime measures in the second quarter. M-real chopped its total paper output by 245,000 tonnes during the April-June period, of which almost 200,000 tonnes was fine paper. Total fine paper downtime for the January-June period reached 300,000 tonnes. The producer's capacity utilization ratio for coated fine paper slumped to 80 percent in the first six months of this year and the figure for uncoated fine paper stood at 93 percent. Price rise push While M-real has taken aggressive measures to balance production and demand, the company has also been trying to improve coated woodfree prices. Negotiations to raise indent prices for coated woodfree paper in Germany have been followed by similar measures in France. The company is confident that it will be successful in its plans to bring the weaker indent levels closer to stock prices. Sappi has also increased indent prices for coated woodfrees but stock prices have remained unchanged. ""Indent prices have slipped slightly, we brought them back to where they were before. So there hasn't been a general price increase for coated woodfree paper in Europe,"" the company's executive chairman Eugene van As clarified.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH  Gas TPA agreement signed in Spain Some very good news just in from Spain.  Last week, Enron Espa?a Generaci?n=  and Enagas reached a long-term agreement whereby Enagas will provide Enron=  Espa?a Generaci?n with regasification and transport services of natural ga= s of approximately 1,7bcm annually between Huelva and our planned combined = cycle gas turbine plant at Arcos de la Frontera (Cadiz).  The services will=  begin in 2004, a date that coincides with our planned schedule for commenc= ement of operations for the plant.  Well done to all the team.  Enron launches derivatives for three new tanker freight routes in shipping = market Enron's tanker freight team has this past week increased their derivatives = portfolio (freight futures or 'swaps' of monthly contracts up to four month= s out) for three new tanker freight routes on EnronOnline. The tanker freig= ht derivatives will be benchmarked against published indices for the three = routes on the 'Baltic International' (BITRA) and International Independent = Tanker Rate Assessment (IITRA) exchanges to help ship-owners (including oil=  companies), charterers, traders and even banks with exposure to the shippi= ng market, mitigate the volatility of the freight element of tanker voyages=  traveling from Singapore to Japan (30,000 tonnes), the Caribbean to the US=  Gulf (70,000 tonnes) and Rotterdam to New York (33,000 tonnes).  Derivativ= es for the three routes will be managed out of the Singapore, Houston and L= ondon offices respectively.  ""Volatility of the tanker freight market has b= een as high as 62% on some routes,"" explains Scott Moncrieff, Enron's direc= tor of Liquids Freight Trading, based in London.  ""This has increased the i= mportance of freight in relative terms on most tanker routes""=20  ""In nine months we have already traded more than 3 million tonnes of paper = freight, with a value of more than USD 14 million on the existing 80,000 to= nne Sullom Voe (North Sea) to Willemshaven (Germany) route, and we expect t= o achieve similar levels of interest on our three new routes.  The tanker f= reight market is estimated to be worth more than USD 15 billion annually, a= nd with increased liquidity being brought to the sector because of more pla= yers entering the market there's plenty of opportunity for us to build our = business.""  The tanker freight team is also very heavily involved in the physical chart= ering of tanker vessels in Europe, The Americas, Arabian Gulf, Mediterranea= n, Far East and US West Coast, utilizing both the spot shipping market and = Enron-controlled 'time-charter' vessels.  Nordic Pre-Pay Deal The Nordic origination team has closed their first municipality power pre-p= ay deal in the last week. This is the first deal to be completed based on a=  financing structure that Enron Nordic Energy negotiated with Den Norske Ba= nk earlier this summer. The deal is an important reference for municipaliti= es that are interested in raising cash without selling their ownership in l= ocal power companies.  Steel Products In March 2001 the European Steel Group commenced operations as an expansion=  of the successful effort underway in North America.  The group offers both=  physical and financial commodity grade steel products and serves as the on= ly market-maker for a commodity market that is larger than that of crude oi= l.  The mission is to introduce the concept of indexation and financial con= tract to an industry where price transparency and risk management are virtu= ally non-existent.  Physical and financial contracts for hot rolled and col= d rolled steel are currently on offer via EnronOnline.  Interest from Europ= ean producers and end-users is keen with the first financial transactions e= xpected to close by the end of Q3.=20  Since the team's inception they have successfully completed transactions wi= th counterparties in Kazakhstan, Egypt, and China amounting to nearly 50,00= 0 metric tonnes of steel. =20  Forest Products Enron's European Forest Products group is now trading physical market pulp = to complement the financial derivatives products already offered for the la= st 2 years, increasing the volume under contract by 30%.=20  Over the past six months, the group has recruited physical pulp traders to = handle its day-to-day physical pulp trading business.  ""We have sourced lon= g-term physical supplies of ""market pulp"" from around the world which will = complement the financial derivative products we have already been offering,= "" explains Martin Holmes, Director of Enron's European Forest Product Opera= tions.  By trading both physical and financial contracts, Enron is pioneering more = creative pricing in the industry by offering physical and financial cash an= d forward prices, as well as being the only market maker to quote longer da= ted swaps.  The group is also actively looking at structured finance opportunities incl= uding a number of inventory deals. These opportunities have arisen as the b= enchmark pulp price for Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft (NBSK) has fallen = by 45% over the past 6 months, leaving producers with high levels of pulp i= nventory in warehouses.  On 2nd July, the group launched the first standard contract for Bleached Eu= calyptus (BEK) pulp on EnronOnline, and is actively marketing to industry b= rokers to adopt the contract as the benchmark index for pricing. The contra= ct meets the commodity specifications of the BEK contract on the London Pul= pex futures exchange, where Enron is the only market maker for all pulp fut= ures contracts offered.

2022-04-22 23:27:45+00:00,false,6,"   Kevin,  Here are some numbers for you to look at.  I worked up three cases, one looking at a San Juan route, and two others looking at El Paso's Line 2000.  The first Line 2000 case assumed that the line was empty and could be dedicated to this project, which is probably not realistic.  But another way to look at this is it would be very easy for El Paso to incrementally build out capacity on Line 2000 to serve new Phoenix loads.     The second Line 2000 case (third case overall) assumed that there was already 320 mmscfd of capacity used up, and that 450 mmscfd of capacity for Phoenix markets would be layered on top of that.   This is very close to, or at, the maximum capabilities of this line without loop.  I also gave a range of costs based on some variability in the lay costs for pipe and purchase costs of new horsepower.

2022-04-22 18:31:45+00:00,true,6,"  Guys,    I called PNM again today to inquire about the losses that are based on 3% of the market price that is determined by PNM's marketers.  Currently, they were priced at $100 market price times 3%, or $3 per MWh.    Don at PNM transmission did not respond to me by yesterday as I had requested, and of course when I called him today, he is out until Monday.  So I talked to a Mark who could not give me much of an update.      The last time I talked to PNM, Don was going to take my request to have July's Market price that PNM was using for losses moved down to below the cap of $91.87.    As of today, they have changed only August's transmission loss factor to the current cap price of $91.87 and posted this on their website as of this week.     I also asked why they let their marketers decide on a market price for losses when marketers are not supposed to be involved in transmission or transmission pricing.  Mark's response was that Losses are not ancillary and therefore, the marketers are allowed to suply information.  I will check into this.  I have left a message for Don to call me on Monday, as I would like to discuss the following items: 1. why they are unwilling to adjust the ""market price"" down for loss charges for July 2001  2. how their marketers 'decide' on what market price they will use, ie- is there a formula? 3. Why they are using the cap price for August when prices are well below the cap  Please let me know if you have any more questions you would like me to pose to them when I speak with Don on Monday.   To view the changes to their website, go to :  http://www.swoasis.com/OASIS/PNM/data/listofproviders?PROV=PNM  From the website:  ""Notice: The Loss Pricing for the month of August has changed from $100 to $91.87, which equates the change from $3.00/MWH to $2.7561/MWH. This is based on the FERC-Migated price outside of California.""","Guys, I called PNM again today to inquire about the losses that are based on 3% of the market price that is determined by PNM's marketers. Currently, they are priced at $100 market price times 3%, or $3 per MWh. Don at PNM transmission did not respond"
2022-04-22 04:24:06+00:00,true,6,"  paperloop.com SAN FRANCISCO, July 30, 2001 (paperloop.com) - While coated paper prices declined in July because of cheaper imports and flooded domestic inventories, uncoated papers, including free-sheet, have been spared a dramatic turn by industry-wide downtime efforts and inventory management.  Even considering the increase in South Korean uncoated free-sheet and European uncoated mechanical imports, prices managed to remain relatively stable, dipping only slightly in what many producers and merchants are calling the most depressed market in over two decades. One forms bond manufacturer and one merchant both stated that, while business was ""lousy,"" prices were holding.  However, spot market deals dramatically impacted rolls of uncoated 50-lb offset. Another trend in publishing spheres is downgrading from uncoated free-sheet to cheaper, uncoated white groundwood. Sources said that, although these groundwood alternatives do not meet all the specifications for permanence, they are being sold in increasing volumes by Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. and Alliance Forest Products Inc., which Bowater Inc. plans to acquire.  The largest grade of uncoated free-sheet in production, demand, and sales is repro bond, yet reprographic paper takes an annual downturn in the summer months due to lowered office demand and school closures. End uses for the paper are in personal printers and/or photocopiers. Most merchants expect a swell in demand in August, when schools will actively bid. Another factor in the expected increase of repro usage is the decrease in heavier trade book and offset uncoated papers.  Some paper manufacturers, praising North American mills in their choice to take downtime rather than discount across-the-board, felt that continental production has more of an impact on the domestic market than imports. From January to March of this year, the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI) released figures that put uncoated mechanical exports 3.7 percent higher in the first quarter than year-to-date figures.  Indeed, extensive downtime has been the saving grace of uncoated papers over the last six months, sources said. Beginning in the first quarter with exorbitant energy costs in the U.S. West, and continuing through the lack of demand in the second and third quarters, lost tonnage has saved manufacturers the costs of energy, freight, surplus inventory, and labor.

2022-04-22 04:24:17+00:00,true,6,"  paperloop.com BRUSSELS, July 30, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The pressure has eased on hardwood spot prices in Europe as Indonesian hardwood pulps continue to slip out of the European market.  This has been caused by factors such as higher prices in Asia, timber supply problems and environmental pressure. Eucalyptus is available on the spot market for $340-360/tonne, which, after discounts and rebates are taken into account, is little different to the regular transaction price of approximately $400/tonne.  Spot prices for northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) are at $400/tonne at best, a price below which many North American producers fail to break even. There can be little room for spot prices to fall further. As is typical in a buyer's market, the distinction has blurred somewhat between regular and spot business, with many combined deals going on of regular tonnes topped up with spot.

2022-04-22 14:49:53+00:00,true,6,"  In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001. Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.  Stack Manager Changes  Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.  In order to turn on this functionality select the "" Allowed Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected.  Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.  Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.  In order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed as Restricted Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the ""Restricted Top of Stack"" feature.  Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the "" All"" option from the drop down box.   Website Changes  New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.    The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box.   Price of Limit Orders   Modify Limit Orders  Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the ""Today's Orders"" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the ""Set"" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.  Expiration time for Limit Orders Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.  Float the Today's Orders Section You can now float the "" Limit Order "" section. In order to do so, right click in the ""Today's Orders "" section and select the float window option. In order to make the window "" Stay On Top "" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.  Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.  In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.  Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.   Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.  If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

2022-04-22 09:10:23+00:00,true,6,"  SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 8, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Skeena Cellulose, Inc. could be forced to close in another month because the local government is unwilling to continue subsidizing the Vancouver, B.C.-based firm's operations, Northern Development Minister Rick Thorpe told The Canadian Press. Skeena's credit line expired on Thursday, and the government is now working with the Toronto-Dominion Bank to secure a one-month financial extension for its mill in Prince Rupert. The mill, which has capacity to produce about 478,000 tonnes/yr of northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK), has taken considerable downtime this year. Skeena's 450 tonnes/day ""B"" line has remained shuttered since January, losing at least 12,000 tonnes per month or some 30 percent of its capacity. In July, the firm closed its ""A"" line as well, which has effectively shut its pulp production. The Canadian government has been trying to sell the mill since it bailed out the struggling firm back in 1997 but in the current difficult pulp market few expected a deal could be made in the short term. But Thorpe warned the government would shut down the mill if that doesn't happen. The province, which owns 58.5 percent of Skeena, has invested about $178 million in the firm. Toronto-Dominion Bank, employees, and unions own the balance. The latest development follows speculation from various British Columbia sources in recent weeks that Skeena would be shut down. ""There is speculation that (Skeena's second) line is down for good. It's highly likely that it will never come up again,"" said a B.C.-based source, who noted the operation has continued to absorb tax revenues.","SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 8, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Skeena Cellulose, Inc. could be forced to close in another month because the local government is unwilling to continue subsidizing the Vancouver, B.C.-based firm's operations, Northern"

As of now, OES has dispatched 130 state OES and local government engines to battle numerous stubborn  blazes including the Emigrant Gap fire in the Tahoe National Forest near Interstate-80.  At OES Headquarters, resource requests are being managed by the State  Emergency Operations Center and the Inland Region Emergency Operations Center, which have been activated. Fire & Rescue, Law Enforcement, Telecommunication, and Operations staff of OES are all active in this effort at headquarters and in the field.  Emigrant Gap Fire is one of more than seven Northern California fires  being closely monitored by OES. Combined, the fires have burned approximately 107,000 acres. All fires combined bring the total OES-coordinated response to 26 fire engine strike teams working 107,000 acres (see chart for participating cities and counties) alongside other local, federal and state agencies.   The local and state-owned equipment has been dispatched through California's Fire and Rescue Mutual Aid System, administered by OES, to assist the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and federal wildland fire agencies, and local departments.  The system is designed to ensure that additional resources are provided to local jurisdictions whenever their own resources are committed or insufficient for any fire or rescue operation.  Each strike team consists of five fire engines - with three to four firefighters per engine - and one strike team leader per team.    Four of the seven fires are being battled by local firefighters called to duty by OES under the Mutual Aid system:    EMIGRANT GAP FIRE (20 miles west of Truckee in the Tahoe National Forest)  1 Strike Team of five OES engines from: Grass Valley Woodland Delta Fire Protection District in Rio Vista Folsom  City of Sacramento  1 OES Satellite Communication Trailer 1 OES Satellite Unit  12 Strike Teams made up of 60 Local Government Engines from: 1 Calaveras County (5 engines) 1 Colusa and Yuba counties (5 engines) 1 Nevada County (5 engines) 2 Placer County  (10 engines) 2 Tahoe Basin  (10 engines              from California and Nevada) 2 Sacramento County (10 engines) 1 San Joaquin County (5 engines) 1 Stanislaus County (5 engines) 1 El Dorado County (5 engines)  MODOC COMPLEX FIRE (near Alturas) 2 Strike Teams made up of 10 Local Government Engines from: Alameda County Team (5 engines) Oakland Berkeley Alameda County Livermore Livermore Lab Sonoma County Team (5 engines) Cazadero Cloverdale Gold Ridge Coast Guard at Two Rock City of Sonoma  BLUE FIRE (U.S. Highway 395 near Likely) 5 Strike Teams made up of 25 Local Government Engines from: Sutter County (5 engines) Stanislaus County(5 engines) Nevada County (5 engines) Shasta County (5 engines) Tulare County (5 engines)  OBSERVATION FIRE  (U.S. 395 near Termo) Three Strike Teams made up of 14 OES Engines Shasta County Weaverville Tehama Mt.
