2022-04-06 23:46:31+00:00,true,1,"  Vince-  1. We can detect ""hoarding"" of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against  the actual inflow.  2. We can detect ""market power"" by dissociating the seller from the buyer,  distinguishing between the physical ""cost"" in gas to run the generators and  the transmission cost in dollars, i.e. the basis.  3. (As you noted) We can detect ""storage"" as the difference between inflow  and consumption.  It appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model  of gas prices: flow rates at interconnects (from telemetry) and spot-market  prices. There is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing  capacity, as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts. The dynamics of gas  prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for  the weather, as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors:  hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas.  We can ""calibrate"" the  price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage, and the price  elasticities of demand for transmission, as well as the extent of hoarding,  from the two sets of numbers mentioned: flows and prices.  What the basis  trader needs to understand are the incentives, and disincentives, for storage  and capacity-hoarding, in terms of the calibrated price-elasticities, and  each of these are as-if exotic call options at the consumption hub.  Finally,  flows are ""explained"" by the model, and can be imputed from prices if  necessary, resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of  the weather.  I believe the problem is quite tractable, and I would like to proceed with a  model.  Clayton","Vince- 1.

2022-04-06 15:28:29+00:00,true,5,"  The discussion of free trade I circulated was short of discussion of some hot topics these days.  Here is a continuation on environmental and labor rights.  Environmental issues  Pat: The US had laws only permitting imported products if caught in ways friendly to sea turtles and dolphins.  The WTO principle of regulating products but not production processes ruled these laws out of bounds.  Chris: Some countries compete for companies to locate production facilities by having lower environmental standards.  Thus, free trade puts poor nations in competition with each other, halting them from regulating environmental standards.  Instead, we see a ""race to the bottom"" where environmental regulations are lax.  Pat: But a poor nation should be able to choose its own level of regulations.  If lower regulations produces more jobs, why shouldn't a poor nation be free to pick laxer regulation and less starvation?  Chris: Well, I am unsure of your definition of ""nation.""  In many poor nations, the people who suffer from pollution are not informed of the hazards and are not very politically powerful.  Instead, they are just poor people who live downstream from a horrific factory or mine.  Pat: I acknowledge some regimes are undemocratic.  I just am unsure if restricting trade with them will help the poor people you and I both care about.  Chris: Speaking of undemocratic, the same ""race to the bottom"" shows up in labor rights.  Nations with effective laws restricting child labor are at a disadvantage to competitors where such laws are not enforced.  Similarly, nations win the game of attracting foreign investors if they shoot union leaders and otherwise restrict employees' rights.  Moreover, slave labor remains present in some nations with various forms of indentured servitude.  The WTO makes it illegal to sanction nations based on these horrific practices.  Pat: Like you I oppose 10 years old in dangerous factories, slavery, and shooting or imprisoning union leaders.  I just do not think trade barriers are a very effective solution to most of these problems.  Children do not work because their parents are mean, but because they are poor. Restricting their work makes no sense and does not help them. If rich nations want children in poor nations to go to school, we should be subsidizing meals and tuition for schools in poor parts of the world, not restricting poor families' already limited options.  Chris: So would you permit ANY deviations from widely agreed-on labor standards.  According to your logic we should have have permitted trade with Nazi Germany, just as you would encourage trade with China in spite of its horrific human rights abuses.  Pat: We again agree on the horror of China and other nations' abuse of human rights.  At the same time, WTO membership and a rising standard of living seem the most likely ways to help democratic reformers in China.  I remain unsure why we should undertake actions that hurt this opening process, even if it assuages our conscience.

2022-04-06 14:15:14+00:00,true,5,"  Here are some recent questions I've gotten from your classmates and my answers to them.   >  Thanks for the interesting articles.

The more cautious is > that Argentina, held back by its strong currency and > lack of competitiveness in the region, will at best > see anaemic growth next year. That would be unlikely > to raise much enthusiasm among foreign investors, and > could complicate Argentina's task in raising the >  Dollars 17bn or more it needs from the capital > markets to cover next year's financing gap.  Basically, this is what the country needs to come up with to balance its Current account deficit.  Suppose everything is in balance but then a foreign exporter like Boeing sells a plane to Argentina but decides not to keep its pesos in Argentina in a bank account or by reinvesting it in the economy but instead to convert its proceeds into dollars.  Now unless an equivalent amount of pesos is invested by some other foreigners in Argentina (converting their dollars into Pesos), the currency board will have to sell dollars to Boeing in exchange for pesos and decrease the supply of pesos in the economy and reduce its foreign reserves.  Now think of millions of transactions going on.  If on balance, argentina has to use its foreign reserves to balance its current account it will start to deplete them.  At some point it would either have to devalue (to make it more expensive for Boeing to sell pesos for dollars) or effectively raise interest rates to very high levels in order to attract investment. Now, with a fixed exchange rate Argentina cannot devalue.  so it must raise interest rates which would further weaken the economy.  One solution is to lower its budget deficit.  This decreases the country's total borrowing needs and implies that interest rates will decline helping spur domestic investment.  This also helps to restore foreign investors' confidence.  This should lower the risk premium and bring down interest rates more.    >In terms of what shifts the IS-LM curve, are these things such as: > a. China's potential entry into WTO which would open up the market to  increased > foreign investment thus, increasing competition which would result in  increased > consumption (lower prices) and unltimately a shifting of the IS curve  because > there would be a greater demand for goods and services  This is really too indirect and long-term, you really want something that directly changes government spending or some sudden decision to change consumption or investment behavior in order to shift the IS curve.  It would be more like Japan's decision to stimulate the economy through more government spending.  Or say Brazil lowering pension payments thereby shifting the IS to the left.  Or how countries are suddenly forced to invest to counter Y2K  > In the book on p. 193, it says ""expansionary fiscal policy abroad reduces  investment."" > Not clear here.  This assumes that the foreign countries have a big effect on world savings (if not there is no effect).  In this case if they spend more they essentially reduce the amount of funds available to everyone else to borrow.  This drives up the world interest rate which lowers investment since the costs of investment is now higher (I is a function of r)  > P.194 on chart: why doesn't r* go up?  This is because in a small open economy, the interest rate is equal to the world interest rate which is fixed.  The country is too small to affect r.  The idea is exactly the same as in micro when we say that firms are price takers.  here the price is r.   > In Japan, how does 0% r get rid of deflation?   Think of it simply as increasing the money supply.  In the classical model (see p154-158).  A higher M results in higher prices.  This is the opposite of deflation where prices fall.","Here are some recent questions I've gotten from your classmates and my answers to them. Thanks for the interesting articles.

While the remaining member of the ""Big Seven"" local=20 organizations, the National League of Cities, has backed the proposal's=20 intent, it is waiting until its annual meeting in December to vote on=20 supporting it officially. Description: The idea centers around establishing a ""trusted third party,"" = or=20 tax clearinghouse, to collect and remit sales taxes based on the purchaser'= s=20 tax jurisdiction.

History: The plan was drafted after a series of marathon meetings by the=20 local organizations that argue they are jeopardized because of lost sales t= ax=20 revenues from e-commerce. Organizers of the proposal, which is being touted= =20 by Gov.

Under the= =20 Internet Tax Freedom Act, no new taxes may be applied to e-commerce, but=20 existing taxes, such as sales and use taxes, are not covered. The sponsors= =20 say they do not need the commission's go-ahead in order to implement the=20 system, which would be optional by state and would not require all 50 state= s'=20 involvement to function. Comments: The plan is widely criticized by anti-ta= x=20 advocates and those who believe that taxing e-commerce will stifle its=20 growth. Others say that the pro-tax movement is only supported by the=20 national government organizations and not their members, with Leavitt being= =20 the notable exception, and criticize it for not receiving many other=20 individuals' support.

2022-04-06 13:31:35+00:00,true,5,"  Hi Everyone,  I thought it would be helpful to you, in filling out the faculty evaluations, if  I explained a bit further how the administration views the quantitative rankings you give to instructors.  Specifically, there are two questions at the end of the evaluation form that ask you about the teaching effectiveness of the instructor and whether you would recommend the instructor to a friend.  You are asked to answer these two questions on a scale from 1 - 7, with 1 being ""Not at all effective"" and 7 being ""Extremely effective.""  As viewed by the administration, a median score of 5 or above is considered acceptable.  While we would love to have everyone earning a 6, this is quite difficult to accomplish!  Scores below 5 are taken very seriously.  In the case of a visitor earning below a 5.0, he or she is given one more semester to improve their teaching.  If in the next semester the instructor does not improve (earn a 5.0 or above), it is unlikely he or she will be rehired.  In the case of a regular faculty member earning below a 5.0, the administration works with him or her on a plan to improve his or her teaching.  In some cases, the instructor may not be allowed to teach the course again.  Please be sure to utilize the full range of the evaluation scale so that we can continue to reward those  faculty members who are doing a great job and work with those who need improvement.  Cheers,  Diane   ","Hi Everyone, I thought it would be helpful to you, in filling out the faculty evaluations, if I explained a bit further how the administration views the quantitative rankings you give to instructors.

2022-04-06 15:33:22+00:00,false,5,"  Aslo, a few links are below.  From BusinessWeek in 1997   http://www.businessweek.com/1997/30/b353757.htm COMMENTARY: IN THE NEW ECONOMY, THE OLD RULES STILL LIVE              These are tough times for traditional inflation theory. A soaring U.S. economy,             fueled by the forces of globalization and technology, has pushed joblessness             down to levels not seen in decades. But consumer inflation remains tame, and             producer prices are actually falling. Convinced that the New Economy can             continue along this course, investors have bid the stock market to new highs.              But there's a more classical view of the economy that still should be heeded.             Virtually all mainstream economists say it's too early to scrap economic theories             that for decades have reliably predicted inflation. Ignoring these basics is             especially risky in a high-flying financial climate that is sensitive to Federal             Reserve policy decisions.              INFLATION AND JOBS. First, a review of the Econ 101 lectures you may             have slept through. The topic: Phillips curve theory and the concept of NAIRU, a             clunky acronym for ''non-accelerating-inflation rate of unemployment.'' Together,             these relate joblessness and inflation--NAIRU being the jobless rate at which             inflation is stable. The Phillips curve/NAIRU model suggests that inflation is             caused by excess demand--demand beyond what available workers and             machines can satisfy. The excess occurs when the jobless rate dips below             NAIRU, causing wages and inflation to accelerate. But the process doesn't end             there. Higher inflation reduces demand and labor markets readjust, pushing             joblessness back to the NAIRU level. But the inflation persists at the higher level,             partly because people adjust to it.              Despite the current, unusual situation of low unemployment and low inflation, the             old model is alive and well among economists--and at the Fed. ''I am a strong             and unapologetic proponent of the Phillips curve and the NAIRU concept,'' says             Federal Reserve Governor Laurence H. Meyer. Chairman Alan Greenspan,             warming to the New Economy, is less enamored. But he appreciates the model's             solid track record.              The Phillips/NAIRU model has practical limitations. But understanding those             limits doesn't mean junking the theory. The model can still work, but it's crucial to             peg the level of NAIRU--a moving target. Before globalization and technology             pushed NAIRU below 6% a few years ago, the model had a two-decade run as             one of forecasters' best-performing tools. Now NAIRU may be even lower than             the generally accepted range of 5 1/2% to 5 3/4%.              It can take a year or more for inflation to pick up after a gap opens between the             unemployment rate and NAIRU. That's why the Fed's experiment to test the             economy's inflationary limit is dangerous. The wider the gap, the more inflation             will rise--and it will not fall until the jobless rate exceeds NAIRU. That is, until the             Fed steps in to clamp down on the economy, thus throwing a lot of people out of             work.              ECONOMIC WINDFALLS. Another consideration: The Phillips/NAIRU             model cannot reflect good economic luck, and this U.S. business cycle has had             more than its share: falling oil prices, a stronger dollar, and weaker growth among             overseas competitors. Also, a slowdown in benefit expenditures has curbed labor             costs, even as wage growth has picked up--as the model predicts.              Right now, the model does not forecast any strong pickup in inflation. But for             every half point the jobless rate stays below NAIRU for a year, inflation will             accelerate by a quarter point. And a stronger second half could send the             unemployment rate even lower.              That's great--if you're seeking employment. But traditional inflation theory says             that, if the Fed's current gamble with tight job markets fails, the costs of excess             demand now will be foregone output and income later on. Even in the New             Economy, the old approach to gauging future inflation should scarcely be             ignored--it should be embraced.              By James C.

Turnover is high in low-wage jobs, so employment might fall, but not due to many layoffs -- just lower hiring.  The point remains that employment still declines.  Most estimates are that the employment declines are quite small, so that low-wage workers on average come out ahead with the rise.  David I.

2022-04-06 08:58:14+00:00,true,5,"  By , Inter@ctive Week November 19, 1999 7:12 AM PT     This week's Webcast tied to ABC's ""The Drew Carey Show"" drew 1.9 million  viewers, making it one of the largest Webcast events in Web history.   But anointing the Nov. 17 Webcast as the single largest multimedia event  online depends mostly on how you do the counting.   The Web video -- produced by ""Drew Carey"" creator Bruce Helford and Warner  Bros. Television and intended to be watched simultaneously with the on-air  broadcast of Wednesday's ""Drew Carey Show"" episode -- was able to stagger its viewership  over three separate airings of the television show in the Eastern, Mountain and Western  time zones of the United States.   Consequently, it's difficult to make comparisons with previous Webcast  events. Online broadcasts, such as February's online lingerie fashion show by Victoria's  Secret and Broadcast.com that drew an estimated 1.4 million visitors, typically have  been one-shot live events drawing all of their traffic during a single showing of the Webcast.   Figures detailing peak online viewership levels are not yet available. Warner  Bros. cobbled together a network of online multimedia distribution companies to handle the  Nov. 17 Webcast's traffic, making it difficult to compile detailed viewership data  quickly, said Jim Banister, executive vice president of Warner Bros. Online.   Warner Bros. contracted with a string of companies -- including Akamai  Technologies, Enron, e-Media, Globex, iBeam Broadcasting, InterVU and Sandpiper Networks --  to carry the Webcast feed. Because of the scattered nature of the distribution system,  it is hard to tell how many users were blocked from accessing the video feed or to  determine how long viewers stayed tuned in to the Webcast, Banister said.   Still, Warner Bros. officials are heartened by the early results and are  planning additional online streaming events, including an online promotion for rock band  Metallica slated for later this month.   ""We are going to see exponential growth in the ability to do Web streaming  events,"" Banister said. ""It's only going to get better and better and more refined.""    11/19/1999 Daily Variety Page 6 Copyright 1999 Variety, Inc.      The first streaming Webisode of ABC laffer ""The Drew Carey Show"" from Warner  Bros. Online attracted nearly 2 million visits, capturing more viewers online  Wednesday night than most cable programming.   Warner Bros. Online also said Thursday it has inked a pact with actor Chris  O'Donnell to begin producing original content for its upcoming entertainment  hub Entertaindom, sometime in the next year.   While watching ""Carey's"" regularly scheduled TV show on ABC, Netizens also  used Microsoft's Windows Media Player to watch what happens inside Carey's  house when he's at work, including Ed McMahon failing to find Carey to hand  him a $1 million check, and dogs and ghosts throwing a bash inside the house.   Warner Bros. is using the Webcast to tease its new online streaming video  venture Entertaindom, which officially bows Nov. 29. Its event slate includes  a weeklong Netcast of the new Metallica album.   The ""Drew Cam"" sweeps event was exec-produced by Bruce Helford and produced  by Warner Bros. Online in association with Warner Bros. Television and  ABC.com.   Tech partners for the event included Akamai Technologies, Don Mischer  Technologies, E-Media, Enron Communications, Globix, Ibeam, InterVu,  SandPiper-Digital Island and Sonic Foundry Media Services.   ""This is a television-Internet first,"" Warner Bros. Online exec VP Jim  Banister said. ""Not only was the program entertaining and evolutionary in its  cross-media creative expression, it also gave birth to a new paradigm in how  to reach large audiences via streaming media.""   Ratings for ""Drew Cam"" may have topped the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show and  MTV's NetAid events, which so far rank as the most watched video broadcasts  online.   Warner Bros. Online also said Thursday that O'Donnell has handed over  management of his Web fan sites to Warner Bros. home page community AcmeCity,  the latest example of an actor attempting to protect his image on the 'Net.   O'Donnell has 57,000 fansites on Yahoo! GeoCities, alone.   Warner Bros. will also help steer the official Web presence of O'Donnell's  George Street Pictures, which produced ""The Bachelor"" and the upcoming CBS  telepic ""Miracle on the 17th Green.""   O'Donnell said he will produce yet-to-be-determined programming for  Entertaindom in the coming year.   ""I want to begin building a core audience of Internet-based fans today  because producing entertainment programming (online) will mean a lot more  than making movies in the future,"" O'Donnell said.","On Nov. 19, 1999, 7:12 AM PT This week's Webcast tied to ABC's ""The Drew Carey Show"" drew 1.9 million viewers, making it one of the largest Webcast events in Web history.

NX =3D trade surplus =3D -trade deficit =3D net borrowing from abro= ad.  When NX is negative (imports > exports), we have a trade deficit.  This is finan= ced by borrowing from abroad.  To a first approximation, when the US spends mor= e=20 on exports than it earns on imports, it needs to borrow to make up the difference.          The trade deficit is not exactly equal to borrowing from abroad=20 because of the returns from net foreign assets.  When the US was a creditor nation,=  it also made money on its investments abroad--this income permitted a modest= =20 trade deficit without borrowing.  Now, as a debtor nation, a modest trade surplus=  is required to avoid the need for new borrowing.  (We are also ignoring=20 government buying and selling of currencies.)  The Current Account Surplus =3D Exports=  - Imports + interest and profits received from net foreign assets.          Exchange rates:  An exchange rate is the price of one currency in= =20 terms of another.  For example, a French Franc (FF) costs 15.7? yesterday, while = it was 10? when I traveled in France in 1985.          The US currently has floating exchange rates, meaning that the valu= e=20 of the dollar fluctuates.  The is about 105.8 yen today, but has varied from 103.76 to 124.44 in the last 12 months.  Thus, the dollar bought fewer yeni= t weakenedover much of the last year.          Under fixed exchange rates there would, in principle, be no day-to-= day changes in the exchange rate.  The Federal Reserve would buy and sell dolla= rs and foreign currencies to keep the exchange rate fixed.  The float is a lit= tle bit ""dirty,"" since the Fed and other central banks intervene on currency markets (i.e., buy and sell dollars) to affect the value of the dollar.          Unlike the U.S., most nations in the world fix their exchange rates with someone.  A few dozen use common currencies: the West African Franc is used=  by many former French colonies and Panama uses the $U.S.  Other countries such=  as Argentine or Hong Kong promise to keep as many U.S. dollars (or DM) as they have circulating currency; this ""currency board"" arrangement makes a fixed exchange rate credible because if folks want to sell the local currency, th= ere are always dollars or DM to redeem them.          The value of the dollar: Many factors affect the value of the dollar: US and foreign aggregate demand, U.S. and foreign interest rates, speculative bubbles, and so forth.  The dollar becomes stronger (i.e., can buy more of = a foreign currency) when US real interest rates (r) are high.  If r is high,= =20 then foreigners want to buy dollars in order to put them into US banks and recei= ve the high interest rate.  When the demand for dollars goes up, so does its= =20 price in terms of foreign currencies -- it gets stronger.  The net demand for dollars is low and the dollar will depreciate (weaken)= =20 when:        *  Foreigners don't want to buy U.S. goods (U.S. exports low, foreigne= rs importing little);       *   US want to buy foreign goods (U.S. imports high, foreigners exporting a lot).  US AD high implies leakage to foreign markets, IM high.       *  Foreigners don't want to buy U.S. assets, often when U.S. interest rates are low.       *  U.S. wants to buy foreign assets, often when foreign real interest rates are high.       *  People think $ will get even weaker.  This adds a speculative dimension, so speculative bubbles sometimes appear to be important, as are expectation= s=20 of foreign or US changes in policy. David Levine    Macroeconomics November 18, 1999          A Morality Play of International Trade  Chris and Pat were having a conversation one day upstairs at Kip's.  Chris: Pat, I don't see how you can be for free trade.  If Taiwan grows fas= ter than us, we will lose.  Pat: Chris, you clearly do not understand the great economist Ricardo's ide= a=20 of Comparative Advantage.  C: That's for sure, I don't.  Wazzat?  P: Comparative advantage is what you are least worst, or most best at.  For example, this great entrepreneur whose name escapes me was the world's fast= est typist, but hired a secretary nevertheless.  He was perhaps 5 times as productive as she was as an entrepreneur, but only 3 times as productive as=  a typist--thus, he had absolute advantage in both, but she had comparative advantage in typing.  C: So what does that have to do with free trade?  P: An example may clarify.  Step over to this handy blackboard, and let me write a bit.  First, imagine a world with two countries, the US and Taiwan,= =20 and two goods, computers and wine.  Further, assume that labor is the only inpu= t into production.  Each country has 100 hours of labor.  First consider a case with no trade, when each nation's output equals their consumption:                          USA WITH NO TRADE           Product                 Productivity            Output          computers               30 hrs / PC              2         wine                    2 hrs / bottle          20            total hours =3D 30 * 2 + 2 * 20 =3D 100                     TAIWAN WITH NO TRADE          Product              Productivity               Output          computers               10 hrs / PC              8         wine                    1 hrs / bottle          20            total hours =3D 10 * 8 + 1 * 20 =3D 100   Note that Taiwan makes computers in 1/3 the US time, and wine in 1/2 the US time.  Thus, Taiwan has absolute advantage at both wine and computers.  Tai= wan has comparative advantage (is most best at) computers.  US has comparative advantage (is least worse at) wine.  Now let's see what happens if we permit trade.  The US will specialize in= =20 wine, what it is best at.  The world price will be about 12 bottles of wine per P= C=20 in the world with trade.                       USA WITH TRADE          Product         Productivity            Output    Consumption           computers               30 hrs / PC              0        2         wine                    2 hrs / bottle          50        26         wine                    2 hrs / bottle          50        26              total hours =3D 0 * 30 + 2 * 50 =3D 100           consumption of wine =3D production - 24 sold to Taiwan           consumption of computers =3D 2 bought from Taiwan                      TAIWAN WITH TRADE          Product         Productivity            Output    Consumption           computers       10 hrs / PC             10          8         wine            1 hrs / bottle           0         24             total hours =3D 10 * 10 + 0 * 1 =3D 100   Both countries receive at least as much of both goods after trade.  (The ex= act price with free trade, and therefore the amount of consumption in each=20 country, depends on the demand elasticities in the two countries and other factors.) Thus, in a world of comparative advantage, trade helps both countries! =20 Nations should specialize in what they do best.  Complete specialization, as in thi= s example, is an extreme case. As Adam Smith pointed out 200 years ago, specialization permits all to grow wealthier.  C: Your argument assumes quite a bit.  Implicit in your example is the assumption that when the US quits producing computers, all of those Cory-ha= ll types be magically transformed into Vit & Eno majors from Davis.  If we are=  in a recession, then the computer workers who lose their jobs won't get new jo= bs; policies to protect our domestic industry can avoid unemployment and increa= se aggregate demand.  P: You are recommending ""beggar-thy-neighbor"" policies, since any gain in o= ur demand is offset by losses to our neighbors'.  If we get started on that ta= ck, the whole world loses.  Not everyone can increase demand by restricting imports!  C: Even without the macroeconomic problem, there is still the unemployment caused by free trade destroying industries.  How will all the ex-computer f= olk get the skills to make wine?  P: You are correct, and both US computer makers and Taiwanese wine makers= =20 (both companies and employees) prefer not to have trade in the short run.  The po= int is that the winners (i.e., US wine makers, Taiwanese computer makers, and consumers in both countries) win more than the losers lose.  C: If free trade brings so many benefits, then it should bring enough prosperity to compensate the losers.  It is not fair to the computer worker= s that they bear the cost of adjustment.  It makes sense to tax some of the winners, and pay some subsidy to help the losers retrain.  Full employment is not your only key assumption.  You also assume that mark= ets are competitive, so that firms make no monopoly profits.  In fact, it appea= rs that some industries make big profits.  When we lose market share in these industries, the capital flows to a less profitable industry.  P: Again, I must grant your point that there are monopolistic industries an= d most Americans would rather the monopoly profits stay at home.  In general, free trade eliminates monopoly profits, and will help consumers enormously.  C: Yes, but in addition to there being high-profit industries, there are high-wage industries, so workers care which industry they are in.  When we= =20 lose market share in these industries, the workers move to industries with lower= =20 pay and lower productivity.  Autoworkers who become hamburger flippers are not making a marginal switch to their next best-paying job.  For example, Boeing has traditionally made big profits, and paid its worker= s well.  When Europeans subsidized Airbus and we lost airplane manufacturing jobs, we lost both those high profits, and the workers had to move to lower-wage employers.  P: I agree that it is theoretically possible for subsidies to increase a nation's welfare, if the subsidies bring oligopoly profits and high-wage jo= bs. Nevertheless, it would be better for everyone if nobody subsidized, and=20 markets were more competitive.  In the US today, both imports and exports are mostl= y made in high-wage jobs.  Thus, we should favor the expansion of trade, not restrictions.  C: Your hypothetical situation is irrelevant, since other nations are subsidizing.  Japan is famous for protecting its industries until they beco= me big enough to compete internationally--then, watch out!  P: Do you really think that the US steel, auto and computer industries are = too small to compete internationally?  C: Well, I have to admit that USX, GM and IBM are not what one usually thin= ks of as part of infant industries.  But the Japanese also subsidize industrie= s and dump exports below cost in order to drive competitors out of business. Once they have a monopoly, then they really gouge.  P: Have the Japanese really increased prices of color TVs, RAM chips, or ot= her goods?  Anti-dumping laws primarily mean that foreigners are not allowed to= =20 cut prices--price cuts that would benefit US consumers.  Even with an uneven playing field, I disagree with you.  As usual with protectionists, you ignore consumers.  When European subsidies created Airb= us, Airbus made the market for passenger aircraft much more competitive.  US consumers won in terms of lower airfares--something you forgot to stress in your arguments about Boeing's loss of high profits and high-wage jobs.  I am very suspicious of these claims that we need to protect all sorts of industries, since it gives companies enormous incentives to pour money into lobbying.  The large firms of the US steel industry have been incredibly successful at lobbying for protection.  This protection has mostly protecte= d=20 an inefficient oligopoly, at great cost to US consumers.  C: But we sometimes need protection as a stick, to beat foreigners into=20 opening their markets to us.  P: While protection can be a stick, it is not easy to wield.  It seems most likely to lead to a trade war, where retaliation by foreigners leads them t= o close markets to us if we restrict trade.  Usually when we run protectionism, it is in the form of the misnamed ""voluntary"" export restraint (VER), like the one that we have with the=20 Japanese for automobiles.  These basically require the foreigners to form a cartel, lower sales, and increase price.  I do not know why the US government helps foreigners run cartels that hurt US consumers!  Anti-trust policy is suppos= ed to restrict cartels.  The auto VERs cost consumers over $100,000 for each US job that is saved.  C:  Well, I am not convinced.  All of your arguments concerning the advanta= ges of free trade are based on this notion of comparative advantage, which you assume is somehow granted by nature.  In today's high-tech industries, comparative advantage is won by experience in producing complicated technologies, not by weather or natural resources.  P: If comparative advantage is won by experience, then experience in produc= ing becomes a sort of investment.  Why can't US firms undertake investments tha= t are profitable?  You cannot seriously believe that IBM is too small to comp= ete with foreigners.  C: But there are spillovers from one industry to another.  The experience o= f Silicon Valley, for example, shows that when one part of high-tech does wel= l, other parts learn from it and do well also.  Even your economists have always agreed that when there are positive externalities that there is a role for public subsidies.  For example, an innovating firm rarely captures all the gains of its research and developme= nt. In the example above, when new computer technologies are developed, only th= e Taiwanese will be able to develop the new products based on their expertise=  in PC manufacture.  P: I agree that companies providing positive spillovers should be encourage= d. I think that support of university research, coupled with an R&D tax credit makes more sense than protectionism.  You, on the other hand, seem to be promoting an ""industrial policy,"" in whi= ch the government picks winners to promote.  Didn't the billions of dollars th= at France and Britain poured into the Concorde supersonic transport, as well a= s wastage of the US with Synfuels synthetic gasoline teach you that industria= l policy won't work?  C: Well aren't you self-righteous.  The US has always had a multitude of vigorous and expensive industrial policies, they have just gone under a=20 variety of other names and have never been coordinated to work together.  Agricultu= re receives billions in subsidies, steel and textiles have quotas on imports, Lockheed and Chrysler received government-backed loans, and housing gets th= e mortgage interest deduction.  Perhaps most importantly, a vast proportion o= f our research is funded by the military, which has always looked to advantag= es for certain industries.  All I want is a rational and democratic industrial policy.  We should coordinate our goals, and choose our subsidies more democratically and in ways that do= =20 not work to cross-purposes.  For example, any bailouts or protection from impor= ts should be short run, and explicitly tied to promises to invest in new=20 machinery and new skills for workers.  New technologies to be promoted should be chos= en by democratically-chosen representatives, not by nameless bureaucrats at DA= RPA (the Defense Advanced Projects Research Administration)--an agency almost nobody has heard of.  P: I would just as soon cut subsidies to all those industries as adjust wha= t subsidies I give.  Nevertheless, I grant you that if subsidies are given th= ey should at least include promises from the industry and its workers to inves= t, not just enjoy high current wages and profits.  C: You're starting to talk sense now.  We must always keep in mind that=20 America needs high tech to maintain its competitiveness.  P: I don't understand this word ""competitiveness.""  I, like you, would like=  US productivity to grow quickly so that we are more prosperous, and have more resources to care for the disadvantaged, the environment, and so forth.  I= =20 care about the absolute level of US growth, not the relative level.  C: But if the US growth more slowly than Japan, we will lose our standing a= s a world power!  P: I am not thrilled about any nation being overwhelmingly powerful.  It is=  ok with me if the US must consult with its allies before invading various smal= l open economies.  C: Well, I have won enough points from you that I should probably stop.  Yo= u agree that (at least in theory) protectionism can help keep high-profit, high-wage, and high-spillover industries at home, and raise national output= .  P: I must agree in theory, and also remind you that the industries have political clout to receive protectionism are often the worst-run. =20 Furthermore, any protectionist policy leads to the risk of trade wars, and they make everyone worse off.

""Getting to the Bottom of Japan's Economic Blues""   1. =0F""A French Paradox at Work=0F"" New York Times November 11, 1999     By=  SUZANNE DALEY            FASTATT, France  Last year, the Beyer family, which owns a small = jam and fruit preserves plant here near the Swiss border, made a proposal to th= eir 18 employees: Would they like a 35hour workweek and continue to be paid for working 39 hours?           To no one's great surprise, the employees said yes. ""An hour more= =20 for yourself is  an hour more,"" said Christiane Grimm, whose job includes slapp= ing labels on jars,  sorting through crates of fruit and watching over bubbling vats of jam. ""There's  lots you can do with it.""       Surprisingly, the Beyers ended up happy, too. The company, one of thousands of  French enterprises that have reorganized their businesses=20 because of a  16monthold law creating one of the shortest workweeks in the world, believes  that it is far better off than before.       In the reshuffle, Philippe Beyer split his 18 employees into two team= s and  staggered their shifts. His factory here in the Alsace region now=20 operates 12 hours a day, up from 8. And it produces 30 percent more than it did last year with only  two extra employees.       The promise of 39 hours of pay for 35 hours of work was a campaign pl= ank that  helped catapult Lionel Jospin's leftist coalition to power in the 199= 7 Parliament  elections. And it remains the glue that keeps Socialists, Communists and Greens  together. It was aimed at creating as many as a mill= ion jobs in a country that has  struggled with a doubledigit rate of unemployme= nt for years.       But many experts think that this bold experiment  which business lead= ers had  warned would cripple France's economy  is not going to be a cureall fo= r the  nearly three million unemployed.       Instead, it could accomplish something the leftist governing coalitio= n never aimed  for: a kind of housecleaning in the French workplace that will tear the cobwebs  from French industry and lead to a more productive and flexible work force, as it  did at Beyer.       ""The primary goal of this policy is very unlikely,"" said Emanuel Ferr= y, an  economist at Banque National de Paris, who is studying the policy. ""But=  it seems  to be having a backdoor effect. It is providing a very good opportun= ity to  renovate the workplace. And it is introducing these elements productivity,  flexibility  quietly without triggering social unrest. So ev= en if the direct goal of  job creation is not achieved, it may still not necessarily be a bad thing for the  economy.""       That may be, but there is hardly a policy that has caused as much argument in  France as the 35hour week. While labor was an early advocate o= f the idea, many  unions have recently demonstrated against it, fearing that = the way it is being  carried out will freeze salary levels and reverse hardfoug= ht gains in employee  rights. Businesses have protested, too. Last month, some 30,000 industrialists and  executives gathered in an empty Paris conference center to wave placards and  chant slogans deploring the policy. They say i= t will cost too much and destroy  France's competitiveness.   Average citizen= s also seem to be losing their appetite for it. Surveys show that the  idea w= as very popular when first proposed, but resistance grew the more the  French considered it. A recent poll found that less than 10 percent of France's citizens now believe that they are going to benefit from shorter workweeks. Most  people suspect that one way or another, they will be inconvenienced. Either way,  it is a subject almost sure to start a fight.       ""People feel very strongly about it,"" Beyer said. ""In this country we= =20 are a little retrograde, we live the way we lived 30 years ago, and this is=20 forcing change and  so people are uneasy with it.""       So far, there is little proof that the 35hour week has created many= =20 jobs. Labor  Ministry officials said in Parliament recently that the plan had=20 created or saved  120,000 new jobs. But one legislator called the figures ""thin air= ,"" and most  economists say a more realistic number would probably be half tha= t. Opponents  also point out that the government has been subsidizing the transition with  business tax cuts and other incentives.       France's economy grew at a healthy rate of 3.2 percent in 1998, and i= s expected to do nearly as well this year. The unemployment rate has dropped = to 11.1 in August  from a high of 12.6 percent in June 1997. But few see much connection between the  new jobs and the 35hour policy.       ""The 35 hours was a political decision,"" a Finance Ministry official said, ""but it  may become a really positive thing. Nothing was moving befor= e. Now suddenly  everyone has to go back and look at the way we have been doin= g business.  People are talking and thinking and being creative.""       The process of carrying out this complicated law, passed in June 1998= ,=20 is still in its early stages. This month, Parliament passed a tangle of more t= han 100 amendments  spelling out exactly how and when the policy should be instituted. One rule: All  companies with 20 employees or more must operate with a 35hour workweek by  the year 2002. So far, only about 16,000=20 businesses, or little more than 1 percent of  eligible French employers, have formally= =20 made plans for the conversion.       Economists say the brunt of the law will be felt unevenly. Some businesses like the Beyer factory will benefit. Others, including service industries, are likely to have a  much harder time.       George Jallerat, who owns Le Grand Monarque Hotel and Restaurant in Chartres,  says he cannot figure out how to reduce his employees' hours, pa= y them the same  wages and not lose money. ""In the end, we will have to raise prices,"" he said.  ""There is no other way.""       Some entrepreneurs are already taking steps to protect themselves. Dr= . Thierry  Sandr, employs 19 people in his medical lab on the outskirts of=20 Paris. He says he  will do all that he can to avoid hiring a 20th person and bring= =20 the 35hour  workweek into his business.       But he does not trust the government to leave him alone. So he has no= t raised the  pay of any of his employees in two years, as a way of saving mo= ney for the day he  has to give them a 35hour workweek for 39 hours of pay. He= =20 says he is not alone.       While the 35hour workweek was being debated, government officials beg= an trying to enforce the 39hour limit that now exists, even among managers. Agents  prowled garages to see what time people were actually leaving. Thousands of  fines were issued, and in one case, the director of a=20 electronics factory owned by  ThomsonRCM was hauled into court for working too hard and allowing his  engineers and other managers to put in an average of 46 hours=  a week. In June, he  received an $18,000 fine. The action prompted some businesses to install time  clocks even for managers and made the governmen= t the butt of jokes.       Those who have jumped at the shortened workweek are often those who w= ere already planning to expand their businesses. For instance, the Packard Bell factory  in the western town of Angers, which makes computers, went to the 35hour week  this year precisely because it wanted to increase production b= y=20 30 percent. To do  that, it needed to reorganize its 1,200 employees into more teams and more shifts.  Offering a 35hour week was a way of opening negotiations with its unions.       JeanLuc Bayel, the director of human resources, said the plan had wor= ked out  even better than anyone expected. ""We have far less absenteeism,"" Baye= l said.  ""And we are seeing a better product. People have to stand to do the= =20 job, and  standing for eight hours is hard. Now they stand for only seven and we= =20 are seeing  a 5 percent reduction in problem computers. We are very happy with = the changes.""       Packard Bell did not take advantage of government subsidies because i= t did not  want to follow government rules. But others like Beyer also saw in= =20 the new law a  way of getting government aid to pay for expansion plans.       At Beyer, for instance, the government aid package will pay nearly 90 percent of  the salary for the two employees he added this year. Next year,=  it will pay about 70  percent and 50 percent the year after that. But Beyer, w= ho took over the business  from his father two years ago, wanted to expand=20 anyway. He says he might have  gone ahead with his plans anyhow, but the law gave h= im=20 a push.       Not far from Beyer's factory, Didier Thuet, who owns a small heating installation  business adopted the 35hour week for just the same reason. ""I= t was an  opportunity to try something,"" he said.       Thuet's business is seasonal. There is little work at all from March = to May. So he  offered his employees a shorter workweek during those months in exchange for a  longer one during peak business periods. They also got an additional six to eight  days off. All six of the employees agreed to a sal= ary freeze until the year was over  and the company could see how much money it made.       But both Thuet and Beyer have their doubts about whether the law will work  everywhere.       And there are complaints from the supposed beneficiaries of the new= =20 jobs. At  Beyer, Sarah Charro, who at 26 had a series of temporary jobs, was hire= d because  of the reorganization, but she has little good to say about it. Sh= e says the  atmosphere in the factory is tense.       ""I feel in some ways like we went backward,"" Ms. Charro said. ""We are working  only 35 hours, but they are trying to push a lot into those hours push, push,  push. We are all stressed out.""       Thuet's new employee, Christoffe Foulon, says the 35hour week is grea= t=20 if he  does not lose any money. But in truth, he would rather work more and ea= rn more.  He says few of his friends seem to envy him. Instead, he says, most= =20 give him a  hard time. ""They treat me like I'm lazy,"" he said.   ******************* 2. Published Monday, November 8, 1999, in the San Jose Mercury News =0F""Latin American markets rally,=0F"" Simon Romero, New York Times  SAO PAULO, Brazil  Buoyed by fresh inflows of overseas investment money, st= ock markets in Latin America are staging a rally  that could presage a return t= o economic growth in many of the region's  countries next year.   Over the last few weeks, indexes like the Bovespa on the Sao Paulo  stock exchange, Latin America's largest stock market, have soared to a  sixmonth high. In Mexico, Latin America's second-largest country, the  bolsa index reached a threemonth high. On the coattails of these  markets, stocks in Argentina, Chile and Colombia registered healthy  gains.   Much of the rally has been fueled by relief over potential interest rate increases in the United States, as recent economic reports have led  some investors to believe that only one increase in rates, instead of  several, = is likely in coming months. Lower interest rates in the United  States, Latin America's biggest source of investment, translates into  more money availab= le for purchases of stocks in the region.    However, a growing consensus that Latin America is positioned for a  revi= val of economic growth next year is also encouraging investors to  increase the= ir stock holdings.    The recovery of some commodities prices, healthy demand for Latin  Americ= an exports in rich industrialized nations and political and  economic=20 developments in countries like Mexico have led analysts such  as Geoffrey Dennis of Salo= mon Smith Barney to predict 3.2 percent  growth for the region as a whole next year, compared with fourtenths  of a 1 percent contraction in 1999.    ``Investors are lifting the veil from a period in which Latin America was oversold,'' said Edmar Bacha, the New Yorkbased strategist for Banco  BBA Creditanstalt. ``What they're seeing, minus the threat of higher  Fed rates= ,=20 is a region looking a lot better next year than this year.''    One of the best examples of this newfound optimism is Chile, a nation  th= at was hit hard by the economic crisis suffered by some of its Pacific  Rim trading partners.    Helped by lower domestic interest rates and a recovery in the price of copper, Chile's economy is expected to grow 5.5 percent in 2000,  compared= =20 with a shrinkage of half a percent this year. And coming  presidential elections= =20 are not viewed as risky, since the two leading  candidates are pledging a simil= ar blend of centrist economic policies,  said Neil Dougall, an economist with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.    In Mexico, politics is also generating optimism over the economy with concern easing over the possibility of disruption resulting from primary presidential elections. And strong growth in the United States, Mexico's  m= ain export market, contributes to positive sentiment over the country's  econom= y, which is increasingly viewed by economists as more linked to  its northern neighbors than to the rest of Latin America.   Yet while prospects look better in countries like Chile and Mexico, it is=  =20 in Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy, where most attention is  focused. = So perhaps it is no small wonder that the rally lifting most Latin  markets is nowhere as dramatic as it is here.    Two weeks ago, Brazil's currency, the real, was getting hammered as speculators who had been betting on weakness pushed the real beyond  two to= =20 the dollar for the first time in eight months. As alarm grew over  the real's decline, Brazil successfully sought greater flexibility to defend  the=20 currency by using money from the International Monetary Fund,  which has oversight o= ver such matters because it is financing an  economic aid package to the countr= y. The real began to strengthen.    ``All of a sudden there was much less pressure on the bank to raise  rate= s=20 to attract foreign capital,'' said Carlos Novis Guimaraes, head of  Latin=20 American investment banking at Lehman Brothers.   With the likelihood larger that Brazil might lower rates rather than raise them, a fresh assessment emerged.  Corporate profits, like those from eucalyptus producers benefitting from  higher pulp prices and banks prosper= ing from prescient investment  strategies, suggested an economic recovery stron= ger than once thought.  Most analysts are predicting Brazil's economy will grow=  3 percent in  2000, compared with 0 percent expected this year.   Still, investors remain cautious about the potential for rebound.  While shocks like Ecuador's moratorium on foreign bonds seem to have  been absorb= ed without causing much damage to investor sentiment,  other factors lead some investors to remain wary.    For instance, interest rate increases abroad, like those announced  Thurs= day by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England,  could undermine Lati= n America's stock rally. Reticence by Brazil's  Congress to approve governmen= t proposals to simplify the tax system  and trim pension spending may also ra= ise a red flag.    Nevertheless, an important shift in sentiment seems to be taking place. = =20 ``It appears that global risk aversion is lowering after the collapses  predicte= d=20 by some people never materialized,'' said Ernest Brown,  senior Latin America economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.  *************3. JAPAN ECHO Vol. 26, No. 1, February 1999 Getting to the Bottom of Japan's Economic Blues KOJIMA Akira         The Japanese economy found itself pushed to the edge of a precipice=  in 1998 by a rapid surge of deflationary pressure. Obuchi Keizo, who succeeded Hashimoto Ryutaro as prime minister at the end of July, proclaimed his new administration an ""economic revitalization cabinet,"" and policy at least shifted in the right direction, however belatedly. The government secured passage for legislation setting aside a huge volume of public funds to deal with the stricken financial sector, and it approved fiscal outlays on an unprecedented scale to stimulate demand. Thanks to these measures, the econ= omy managed to stop just short of the precipice.         During 1999 the economy should enjoy a bit of a breather as the=20 effects of the heavy dose of government stimulus take hold. But it will be no more= =20 than a breather, and it will be essential for financial institutions to take advantage of this temporary respite to restructure their operations and for business corporations to undertake serious efforts to strengthen themselves= .=20 If they fail to do so, the economy is liable to slip back into critical condit= ion as soon as the effects of the stimulus have worn off. This year will be a decisive one, representing as it does the last chance of the twentieth cent= ury for the Japanese economy to be revitalized.         After achieving a recovery labeled miraculous in the years after Wo= rld War II, our country's economy suddenly lost its momentum in the final decad= e=20 of the century. The downturn started in 1991, and from 1992 through 1994 the growth rate was close to zero. In 1995 and 1996 the economy managed to expa= nd by 2%-3%, but then in fiscal 1997 (April 1997 to March 1998) it contracted = by 0.7%. And the growth rate for fiscal 1998 is being estimated at around -2%. This will be the first time in the postwar period that the economy has=20 recorded negative growth for two years in a row. It will also mean that the average growth rate from 1992 through 1998 will fall to 0.7%, dipping below the 1% mark.         Why did the economy suddenly lose its steam? The main causes are th= e speculative bubbles of the late 1980s and the policy blunders following the= ir bursting starting in 1990. Over the course of history, countries around the world have experienced economic bubbles. Where they differ is in the skill = of their policies to deal with the aftermath. Japan's record on this score has clearly been a string of failures. Until 1998 the authorities did virtually nothing to promote the clearing up of the large volume of loans that went b= ad after the collapse of the bubble economy. This huge overhang of nonperformi= ng assets in the financial sector acted as a drag on the economy as a whole, preventing it from regaining its forward momentum. And as the recession=20 dragged on, the bad-debt problem grew even greater in scale. The situation=20 deteriorated to the point where a series of major financial institutions went bankrupt i= n November 1997, setting off an overall contraction of credit.         Earlier in the year the government had implemented a set of belt-tightening measures, including a hike of the consumption tax from 3% t= o 5%, that produced a negative fiscal impulse on the order of \9 trillion. In other words, 1997 was a year of powerful deflationary pushes from both the monetary and fiscal sides of the macroeconomic picture. No economy could withstand this sort of double punch without buckling.         Particularly from November 1997 on, the economy was obviously heade= d down, but even so the government dallied in shifting its fiscal stance and = in dealing with the bad debts that were at the root of the financial deflation= . What set off the powerful deflationary contraction of credit was the first occurrence of default in the interbank market in the postwar period in earl= y November. Despite the smallness of the amount defaulted, the market panicke= d because all its transactions were premised on the absolute impossibility of default. Financial institutions became leery of extending credit to each=20 other, and the interbank market ceased to function smoothly. Every institution tri= ed to build up its own liquidity. And financial institutions whose capital was meager by comparison with the scale of their nonperforming loans found themselves coming under a fierce attack in the stock market. As a result, t= hey moved to raise their capital adequacy ratios by cutting back on their=20 lending.!          This set off a classic credit crunch. LENDER OF FIRST RESORT         When matters reach this sort of pass, the relaxation of monetary=20 policy by the central bank fails to affect the real economy. Though the Bank of Ja= pan has adopted an extremely loose policy stance, actual financial conditions h= ave become severely tightened. This can be seen most clearly in the relationshi= p between the money supply and bank credit. Normally when the money supply (c= ash and bank deposits) expands, the volume of lending by banks grows accordingl= y, and financial conditions relax. But in the credit contraction that became pronounced from the end of 1997 on, bank lending has shrunk in volume despi= te growth of the money supply.         For example, if we look at the figures for the so-called city banks (Japan's major money-center banks) in the 12-month period ending September 1998, we find that their deposits were up 5.3%, but their outstanding loans decreased by 2.5%, or \4.5 trillion. And the ratio of loans to deposits fel= l=20 by a remarkable 8.7 percentage points over the same period. Banks were under pressure to write off their bad loans, which they had been putting off doin= g; the capital crunch in the financial sector was accompanied by a credit crun= ch in the general economy.         So what have the banks been doing with their increased deposits? Th= ey have been avoiding risk by investing them in government bonds, and as a res= ult the yield on the government's 10-year issues has fallen below 1%. This is a first for Japan, of course, and in fact it is unprecedented in capital mark= ets around the world. The problem is that, even as government bond yields have= =20 been falling, the yield on the corporate bond issues of big businesses has been rising. In other words, not only has it become harder for businesses to bor= row from banks, but it has also become harder for them to raise funds from the capital market. Even so, major corporations have been raising some funds through bond issues. But smaller firms that are not in a position to issue their own bonds have felt the full brunt of banks' cutbacks in lending.         If this situation were left untreated, the Japanese economy would h= ave no prospect of recovering. During the course of 1998, therefore, the Bank o= f Japan implemented large-scale purchases (via banks) of commercial paper, wh= ich are notes issued by corporations to cover their operating expenses. In effe= ct the central bank was stepping in to lend where regular banks would not. One might even say that it became the lender not of last resort but of first resort. In addition, other government-affiliated financial institutions hav= e been actively extending loans to companies and other firms.         The root cause of the contraction in bank lending is the remaining= =20 pile of bad loans, which has still not been adequately dealt with. In order to alleviate this problem, the government has come up with a massive \60 trill= ion package of public funding for the financial sector. But bank executives are reluctant to make use of these public funds, fearing that if they do, they= =20 will be expected to take responsibility for the failure of their earlier lending decisions. And under these circumstances the credit crunch appears certain = to continue, even if it becomes somewhat less serious in degree.         The gravity of the bad-debt problem is apparent from the volume of = the asset value lost as a result of the collapse of the bubble economy. In the period from 1991 through 1994 land prices fell \556 trillion, and from 1989 through 1992 stock prices dropped \490 trillion. In other words, the value = of assets in these two major categories plunged by over \1 quadrillion in the post-bubble period, an amount equivalent to more than two years' gross=20 national product. Since a large portion of the purchases of both land and stocks had been financed by bank lending, the deflation in these asset values led=20 directly to the emergence of huge amounts of bad loans. STRUCTURAL FACTORS ADDING TO THE DRAG         The principal causes of the Japanese economy's sudden loss of momen= tum in the 1990s thus appear to have been the policy failures in dealing with t= he aftermath of the bubble years, in connection both with the bad-debt problem= =20 and the handling of fiscal affairs. These were not the only causes, however. Ot= her factors, systemic and structural, account for probably 20% to 30% of the to= tal negative change.         A number of problems may be cited in this connection: (1) Japan completed the decades-long process of catching up with the West. (2) The country was tardy in coping systematically with the forces of globalization= =20 and megacompetition that picked up strength following the end of the cold war. = (3) The Japanese population has been aging at a pace never experienced by any country in the world, and this has heightened people's concerns about the future. (4) The focus of technology has been shifting from manufacturing=20 toward information, software, and services.         The end of the catch-up process meant less scope for growth through= =20 the introduction of technologies and products from overseas, forcing Japan to r= ely on innovations of its own to achieve further economic expansion. Furthermor= e, it had to do so within the context of the world's highest average wage leve= ls.         Next, the advent of megacompetition meant the emergence of rivalry= =20 from the newly industrialized economies, many with wages only a tenth or a=20 fifteenth of Japan's, placing Japanese businesses in a highly disadvantageous positio= n.         Population aging, meanwhile, is a process that has been going on in= =20 all the industrial nations, but in Japan's case it has been progressing at an especially rapid clip. This has forced the country to scramble in order to= =20 make the required systemic adjustments in areas like pensions and employment. In addition to the rise in longevity, there has been a sharp decline in the birthrate, which has further accelerated the rise in the elderly share of t= he population. Early in the twenty-first century, the total number of Japanese=  is expected to start declining. In the 50 years following the end of World War= =20 II, the population grew by an average of about 1 million people a year, but in = the 50 years to come it is estimated that it will decline on average by half a million a year. This will mean a shrinking labor force, which will face an increased burden in supporting the growing numbers of elderly, and it will= =20 also mean shrinking markets. Various systems, including pensions, taxes,=20 employment, and wages, will have to be reformed fundamentally in order to keep them fro= m collapsing. Meanwhile, of course, the vitality of the economy will wane, an= d with it the capacity for economic growth. The outlook is bleak.         Finally, the paradigm shift in technology will pose a major challen= ge for Japan in the period to come. During the twentieth century Japan has bee= n extraordinarily successful with its technology for standardized mass production, which was the dominant paradigm of the century. Automobiles and electric appliances are representative of the fields in which Japanese manufacturers have won strong positions. But since the early 1980s, when Japanese industry was seen by many people to be victorious, the focus in high-value technology has been shifting away from standardized mass product= ion in the direction of knowledge-intensive and information-intensive areas, fr= om hardware to software, and from manufacturing to services.         As globalization has progressed, capital, technology, and managemen= t know-how have been moved actively across national borders, and standardized production was easily shifted to the newly industrialized economies. The=20 medium for these transfers has been cross-border direct investment, which has grow= n=20 by leaps and bounds since the end of the cold war. We have entered an age in= =20 which comparative advantage in standard mass production can be imported. This produces a tendency toward price leveling. In most cases the trend is a downward one, with prices being drawn to the level of the low-wage countrie= s. And it makes it difficult for a high wage country like Japan to sustain hig= h value-added production. THE PARADOX OF SUCCESS         There are two ways out of this difficulty. One is to shift manufacturing operations overseas to take advantage of lower wage levels. The other is fo= r businesses to compete in nonprice areas by coming up with their own technologies and products. Corporations that shift their operations offshor= e can continue to enjoy growth in their consolidated results on a global basi= s, but meanwhile they are promoting the hollowing out of the domestic manufacturing sector. For Japan as a whole the second alternative, nonprice competition, is more desirable, especially now that the goal of catching up with the West has been accomplished. But in order to succeed at this endeav= or, it will be necessary to recast the whole set of systems that were designed = for the catch-up period. The new systems will have to shift their focus from th= e achievement of equality of results to support of those who take risks and display creativity. The system of automatic wage hikes in line with increas= ing seniority will have to be overhauled, and the egalitarianism of the school system will also have to be modified.         Making such reforms will mean fundamentally changing the social val= ues to which we have become accustomed. Resistance is likely to be great. Peopl= e will be quick to agree with the need for reform in principle but will resis= t the particulars that affect their own areas of activity. Already over the p= ast decade we have witnessed many loud calls for reform, leading to numerous reports and recommendations, but there has been little by way of implementation.         One reason for this lack of follow-through is the fantastic success that Japan enjoyed in the economic sphere for the previous several decades. Sinc= e the existing systems and practices were so successful for so long, they hav= e become quite hard to change. This is the ""paradox of success"" or ""reward of success"" to which Peter Drucker refers.         It may be possible for the Japanese economy to get out of its curre= nt hole by overcoming the credit crunch arising out of the bad-debt problem an= d correcting the earlier mistakes in fiscal policy. This, however, will amoun= t=20 to no more than the righting of earlier wrongs. In order for our economy and society to demonstrate vigor and creatively produce new value and new technologies in the century to come, we must overcome the ""paradox of succe= ss"" and remake our long-standing systems and practices. The lack of progress=20 toward this goal is the source of our current sense of being at an impasse.         The massive dose of financial and fiscal stimulus that the government is now administering should halt the severe downturn that started in November 1997, and in 1999 we can hope to see at least faint signs of a recovery. Bu= t=20 it is essential that this respite be used to achieve progress toward systemic reform. Unless this is accomplished, the 1990s will be a ""lost decade"" for Japan, and our economic outlook for the twenty-first century will be a gloo= my one.   David I.

Please see the CQ article below for more information on the legislation in  general.   We will certainly continue to watch for language like this that  might surface in future legislation.   In the context of ECI's larger  legislative agenda, we may also want to explore the potential to develop  legislation that would pro-actively ensure the broadcast of licensed  programming over the internet.  Cheers,  Jeff  *********  TELECOMMUNICATIONS: SATELLITE BILL SURVIVES A SCARE, CARRIES OTHER MEASURES  WITH IT  By Alan K. Ota, CQ Staff Writer   Nov. 18, 1999 - The uproar in the Senate Thursday over deletion of a loan  guarantee program designed to improve rural television service nearly  obscured the significance of the satellite television bill that was linked to  the fiscal 2000 omnibus spending bill (HR3194).   The controversial provision would have created a new Agriculture Department  program to guarantee $1.25 billion in loans enabling satellite providers to  transmit local programming to rural subscribers -- service they insist is too  expensive to provide without help. It was added to the satellite TV bill  (HR1554) in conference but dropped when the final version (S1948) was  referenced in HR3194.  Rural-state senators led by Max Baucus, R-Mont., blocked action on a stopgap  funding bill (HJRES82) until leaders promised them a floor vote on the loan  guarantee legislation or similar provisions by next April 1.  Also dropped from the final bill was language that would haved barred  Internet service providers from obtaining the licenses necessary to transmit  movies, sports events and other broadcast programming. Cable and satellite  providers would be the only entities with such licenses. America Online and  other companies lobbied furiously to strip the provision.  The final measure would for the first time allow satellite companies to beam  local news, sports, weather and other broadcast programming to all of their  customers, just as cable providers do.  And it would grant a reprieve to more than a million satellite subscribers  now receiving local channels who otherwise would lose those signals by year's  end. A court had ruled the subscribers do not qualify to receive local  signals by satellite under current law.  Satellite companies would have to gain permission from local broadcast  stations within six months after they begin retransmitting those signals.  By Jan. 1, 2002, satellite carriers that transmit local channels would have  to carry all of the channels in that community, a ""must-carry"" requirement  already imposed on cable providers.  The measure would extend for five years the licenses under which satellite  companies retransmit the signals of superstations and distant network  stations and reduce the copyright fees they must pay.  The bill would generally retain existing standards for determining which  subscribers are eligible to receive distant network signals by satellite, but  it would require the Federal Communications Commission to review its model  for determining which areas are unable to receive acceptable-quality  broadcast signals over the air.  Like the conference report on HR1554, the final satellite bill carries a  number of pieces of unrelated legislation.  * Patent Overhaul. In a victory for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin  G. Hatch, R-Utah, negotiators included a patent system overhaul bill (HR1907)  that was strongly opposed by some inventors and by the Eagle Forum, a  conservative group headed by political activist Phyllis Schlafly, who argued  that it would permit foreign companies to steal American technology.  The bill would require publication of some patent applications, which have  been filed both in the United States and abroad, within 18 months of filing,  whether or not patents have been granted.  The measure also would require the Patent and Trademark Office to approve or  reject a patent application within three years. It would provide patent term  extensions for any not approved within that three-year period to guarantee  investors a 17-year patent term. Currently, patents are for 20 years, but  inventors often lose years waiting for approval of their applications.  * Low-Power TV Stations. The omnibus spending bill also included provisions  of a bill (HR486) to create a new ""Class A"" license for low-power television  stations equivalent to those granted to full-service ""primary"" stations.  The provisions are designed to help low-power stations that often provide  ""niche"" programming in urban areas and local programming in rural areas  become more stable and commercially viable.  * 'Cybersquatting.' The measure includes provisions of a bill (S1255) to bar  unauthorized use of trademark-protected brand names in Internet addresses.  The bill was passed by the Senate by voice vote Aug. 5; the House passed a  different version Oct. 26.  * PBS Donor Lists. In response to disclosures earlier this year that some  public broadcast stations had exchanged donor lists with political parties --  and primarily with Democratic Party units -- negotiators included a provision  to prohibit such stations from sharing their donor lists with political  parties. It also would bar disclosure of its donors to any non-affiliated  group without the donor's consent. Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., had introduced  legislation (HR2791) earlier this year to prohibit the list-sharing, but the  bill did not advance.

2022-04-06 05:37:58+00:00,true,5,"  Marcello Fontana sent an article from this week's BusinessWeek on an  apparently succesful policy to promote growth.  ECONOMIC VIEWPOINT 'Bribe' Third World Parents to Keep Their Kids in School GARY S. BECKER          Many well-meaning Americans, including college students and religious organizations, have attacked Nike Inc. and other companies accused of using child labor in their overseas plants in poor nations. I agree that something should be done to save the children from dismal long-term economic prospects. However, effective policies must recognize that the fundamental cause of child labor is poverty, not greedy foreign and domestic employers. To combat the effects of poverty, poor mothers should be ''bribed'' to keep their children in school longer.          Really poor families in Brazil, Mexico, Zaire, India, and many other nations put their children to work because their meager earnings help provide basic food and medicine for themselves and younger siblings. Although parents may recognize that schooling would improve their children's marketable labor skills later in life, they cannot afford the ''luxury'' of taking them out of the labor market. In essence, child labor is the result of a conflict between short-term parental economic interests and the long-term interests of the children.          Adequate economic growth always eliminates child labor even without laws  against it. But poor nations needn't wait until they grow richer. There are short-term solutions. Many nations have compulsory schooling laws up to age 15 or so, but they are often hard to enforce, especially in rural areas and poor sections of large cities. Families who want their children to work simply do not send them to school, or the children have very high absenteeism rates. Officials are reluctant to punish parents of working children, perhaps because they recognize that the problem is not selfishness but poverty.          SHARE THE BURDEN. I propose a better way: Give parents a financial incentive to keep their children in school longer. Poor mothers should be paid if schools certify that their children attend classes regularly. Parents would be strongly motivated to send their children to school--even when the children do not want to go--if these payments were not much below what the children could earn. Most poor parents would happily continue.          [A few sentences were cut here.  I think they describe Progresa  program in Mexico.  I think this program pays a few dozen dollars a month to families that keep kids in school and immunized.] Most poor Mexican families earn only about $100 a month. That large a percentage increase should have a noticeable effect on their behavior.          Poor families in less developed nations whose children do go to school are likely to withdraw their daughters when they become teenagers. This tends to perpetuate economic inequalities, since the children of women who receive little schooling also tend to be badly educated. Progresa tries to combat this tendency to favor education of older sons by paying a little more to families that keep teenage daughters enrolled.          NARROW THE GAP. This pioneering Mexican approach appears to be highly successful. An evaluation prepared for an October economics conference in Chile shows that after only a couple of years, Progresa significantly raised the schooling of children in very poor Mexican families. It has also narrowed the education gap between girls and boys and reduced the labor force participation of boys.          Of course, governments need to find the tax revenue to finance programs like Progresa. A good start would be to recognize that Mexico and many other less developed nations typically spend disproportionately on universities and other education of their elites. Redistributing some of this spending to the poor would both reduce inequality and stimulate faster economic growth. Widespread basic education is more effective in promoting economic development than generous subsidies to the richer students who attend universities.          Child-labor critics could spend their time more fruitfully by attacking not the overseas employment policies of multinationals but the social policies of governments in poor nations that are really responsible for the prevalence of child labor there. These governments, and perhaps international organizations such as the World Bank, should follow Mexico's example and introduce programs that pay poor mothers to keep their teenage and younger sons and daughters in school and out of the labor force.

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy giant Enron Corp. has signed a memorandum  of understanding with an undersea-cable operator and is in advanced  negotiations for a separate venture to build a fiber-optic telecommunications  network, Sanjay Bhatnagar, chairman and chief executive officer of Enron  India Ltd., told Dow Jones Newswires.    The two projects are central to an aggressive foray by Enron (ENE), already  known in India for its high-profile energy investments, into communications  services.   Just as it is doing in the U.S., Enron hopes to build in India a national  broadband network to improve data communications, including the use of the  Internet. Initially, Enron aims to build a high-bandwidth backbone connecting  seven large cities, each housing a data center -- a large bank of computer  servers to facilitate Internet applications, such as hosting Web sites to cut  time and cost for Indian Internet users.    Bhatnagar said that Enron has signed an MOU with FLAG Telecom, which operates  a network of submarine cables, to connect Enron's ""Indian network to the  world."" The first leg of that network will be a high-capacity fiber-optic  connection between India's capital, New Delhi, and the country's financial  center, Bombay. Enron is currently finalizing a joint venture with Ircon, the  construction arm of India's state-owned railways, to build and operate the  New Delhi-Bombay link.    ""We are in the process of negotiating the detailed agreement,"" Bhatnagar  said, adding that he believes the joint venture agreement will be signed  within two months.    Ircon is to hold a 50% stake in the joint venture, with Enron, British  Telecommunications PLC (BTY) and Indian conglomerate Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.  holding minority stakes.    Bhatnagar said Enron is negotiating with several potential partners, which he  declined to name, on other pieces of the Indian network. Likewise, in  addition to the Indian railways, Enron is speaking with other bodies,  including a highway authority, on gaining the right of way to lay fiber-optic  cable in other areas of India. It is also likely to team up with private  telephone networks and Internet service providers in the target cities.

Ambassador Barshefsky and Mr. Sperling issued a joint statement that said, AWe are glad that after thirteen years of negotiation, China and the United States have agreed upon a strong, commercially viable WTO agreement for China.  This historic agreement is a win for American export-related jobs, for Chinese economic reform, for our global trading system and for the long-term U.S. - China relationship.  Outline of the Agreement  This agreement provides significant access for U.S. agriculture, industrial products and services.  China will reduce both tariff and non-tariff barriers to industrial goods and farm products.  The agreement contains strong provisions to address import surges and unfair trade practices. China has agreed to take specific actions to ensure fair treatment for businesses operating in China.  These include limits on technology transfer requirements, offsets and export performance requirements.  Some specific examples from the agreement include:  China will cut duties from an overall average of 22.1% to 17%. China will make even greater reductions on agricultural items of particular      interest to the United States. China will establish large and increasing tariff-rate quotas for wheat,      corn, rice and cotton with a substantial share reserved for private      trade. State trading for soy oil will be phased out. China will eliminate export subsidies. American companies can provide auto financing. New access for U.S. companies, including banks, insurance companies and      telecommunications businesses. Distribution rights for U.S. exporters. Improved access for computer services, business consulting, accounting,      advertising,  and financial information services. Increased imports of foreign films, on a revenue-sharing basis, to at least      twenty films per year.  In textiles, the U.S. and China agreed on appropriate measures to avoid      market disruptions during and after the phase out of current quotas.   Next Steps  This agreement represents a crucial step in China?s WTO accession process. Several important steps remain ahead.  First China must conclude bilateral negotiations with a number of other WTO members, including the European Union.  Multilateral negotiations on China?s accession protocol must also be finished.  China must then complete its own domestic procedures for accession.  In response to the commitments contained in the agreement signed today, President Clinton will work with other WTO member countries to gain China?s entry as soon as possible and will seek from Congress the approval of permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR).   ","Finally – we have a China WTO Agreement. Congress must now vote on permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR) with China. We will follow closely and report. OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES.

At the time they said they ""could"" not because the construct of their standby rate did not provide adequately provide recovery for standby service (particularly for non-demand related tariff schedules).  The rejection was were we left the subject with SCE. Their move to submit an advice letter on the subject comes as a surprise to me given their prior response.  We will not be protesting with the presumption that the standby tariff would not prejudice future work on standby tariff rate design.  Generally speaking, the QF requirement is ridiculous and should be removed immediately.  For this reason, we are supportive of it happening now through this advice filing.

2022-04-06 06:00:37+00:00,false,5,"  Cuckoo Paul & Arnab Mukherjee   11/16/1999 The Economic Times Copyright (C) 1999 The Economic Times; Source:  World Reporter (TM)  MUMBAI 15 NOVEMBER   ENRON Communications (ECI), an affiliate of the $31bn energy major Enron  Corp, is preparing for a major push in the Indian communications sector.  Enron will start off by forming a joint venture with the public sector Ircon  (Indian Railway Construction Company) to enter the telecommunication  business. Enron will provide very high capacity broad-band networks as well  as services, followed by bandwidth trading in India, said Enron South Asia  CEO and managing director Sanjay Bhatnagar.   Enrons joint venture with Ircon is expected to help the former use the Indian  Railways reach for laying the fibre-optic networks. Mr Bhatnagar did not  confirm the JV proposal nor reveal precise details but The Economic Times has  learnt that the Ircon board has already cleared the proposal. ECI, through a  separate subsidiary, is likely to spearhead Enrons telecom businesses in  India.   Speaking about ECIs plans, Mr Bhatnagar said, This will be a new business for  us in India, though we have been doing it in the US for over two years.   Enron already has 32,000 kilometres of fibre-optic broadband network in the  US connecting 18 cities. The next-generation broadband network will  incorporate both terrestrial components like fibre-optic cable and space  components like satellites. While the network and the services will be rolled  out nationally within six to eight months, Enron, the worlds largest gas and  electricity trader, will get into bandwidth trading activity in India only  about two years from now, Mr Bhatnagar said.   Broad-bandwidth networks will be the infrastructure of the future, he said,  adding, Enron will use its expertise in energy trading for bandwidth trading.   The networks and services will allow applications like video-conferencing and  video-delivery. We will target multiple customers, including ISPs and  corporates with requirement for high bandwidth, Mr Bhatnagar added.   Bandwidth trading will allow under-utilised networks to be used to full  capacity, as excess capacity will be sold when not needed by particular  customers. These initiatives will also allow hosting of burgeoning Indian  content within India, thus facilitating the domestic Internet market, as  Internet usage becomes easier and more cost-effective, he said.   Globally, there is great synergy between pipelines and fibre optic networks  and it makes perfect sense for Enron to tap the communications potential,  said an energy analyst. The pipelines are used as conduits for fibre optics  which can carry voice, data or video information, he added. Even in India,  some utilities like the MSEB (Maharashtra State Electricity Board) and the  Indian Railways are already using this routing. Electricity and gas  distribution companies have a natural monopoly in the form of their pipeline  and cabling which has the benefit of a wide reach that can be used by others.   Ircon has been known for innovation in its business and has expanded its  international operations in the past few years. The company recently got a Rs  525-crore order from Malaysian Railways, where the company which could not  pay in cash paid Ircon in kind. Malaysian Railway paid MMTC in the form of  palm oil and MMTC paid IRCON cash in India. Ircon also paid its highest ever  dividend of 225 per cent this year to the government. The company made a  profit of Rs 56.2 crore .

2022-04-06 02:14:28+00:00,false,5,"  BY MAX SMETANNIKOV  InterActive Week 11.1.99   Idea is to build on streaming content delivery   While Akamai Technologies and recently acquired Sandpiper Net-works have  captured the majority of mind share as leaders in the emerging content  distribution market, Enron Communications is making a bid to blend together  its assets as a national carrier to beat back the start-ups and make some  major waves in the content delivery business. Last week, Portland, Ore.-based carrier Enron (www.enron.net) announced it  has broadened its content distribution network to focus on streaming media.  The intensified pursuit of the content distri-bution space is likely to come  as a surprise to com-petitors that perceive the carrier as more of a  band-width wholesaler. However, company executives say content distri-bution ofvarious kinds is what  Enron is all about. ""What we do is exactly what they [Aka-mai]  do,"" says Joe Hirko, Enron  president and chief executive. ""The difference is that their   services   are  acceptable for some    content, that isn't mis-sion-cntical, and we have that  same model and we do that for mis-sion-crincal content."" Just like Akamai and Sandpiper,  Enron  is colocating its media dis-tribution  servers with other Internet service providers (ISPs), mem-bers of the  so-called e-Powered  Distribution Program, making it possible for Enron to  reserve bandwidth on partners' networks. The differentiator that Enron brings  to the table is its quality-of-service guarantee, backed by an elaborate  network architecture and business model that Enron is building, which relies  on a combination of alliances and a bandwidth broker exchange. First, Enron has built its own content distribution network with servers  colocated with other ISPs. These carriers include Epoch Internet, Electric  Lightwave, FlashNet Communications, GTE Inte-networking, InterNap, NetRail,  NorthPoint Communications, RCN and Veno. Enron is also pursuing satellite  providers as another group of carriers capa-ble of distributing content in  geographically remote places where fiber networks are not present yet. While traditional content distributors measure their footprint in servers  distributed with other hackhones, Enron uses its points of presence and the  number ofdesktops reached as its basic metrics. Enron says it can shoot audio  and video streams to 25 million desktops via 500 POPs. Second, Enron is in the final stages of establishing its own bandwidth  exchange, a division that would trade space on other carriers networks as a  way to provision bandwidth on demand. Hirko says six interconnection points  for carriers that want to trade on this exchange have been built, and the  first trades will start before the end of the year. This would be the first time a bandwidth exchange business model, in itself a  nascent idea, would be married to content distribution as the means to bring  down the cost of streaming media distribution. ""This is something completely new. I have not seen anything like this,"" says  Tim Strong, an analyst at consultancy TeleGeography in Washington, D.C. The result is essentially complete control over the pipe delivering voice and  video, a position of power that Hirko says will lead to unmatched  performance. ""We are talking 27 frames a second,"" Hirko says, adding that it  is not uncommon to tap into streaming video feeds as low as two or three  frames per second. Enron plans to charge its users less than 5 cents per megabyte delivered. Akamai (www.akamai.com), which doesn't own its own network and uses the  Internet as the means of streaming media delivery, also plans to guarantee near-zero packet loss with its patent-pending, yet-to-be-launched service  called Steady Stream. The biggest challenge for Enron is to convince potential customers that the  carrier is more than simply a bandwidth provider. To date, Enron's only  public streaming media client is CountryCool.com. Enron officials see an opportunity to barge into the industry by  commandeering the unconquered segment of the content distribution market  streaming media  where Akamai and Sandpiper have yet to make a name. ""We are using Akamai for distribution of objects and static images,"" says  Monty Mullig, vice president of CNN Internet Technologies. ""It's possible  Akamai might work for streaming media, but I have not seen that product from  them yet."" CNN Interactive is distributing most of its video through Intervu,  one of the first providers of streaming media services. While Mullig is intrigued by the prospects of Enron's bandwidth exchange  services, he has yet to be convinced the company offers a compeffing service. ""They haven't put a product in front of us that we would be interested in,""  Mullig says. ""We want a big audience behind the service that we buy  like  Akamai's. On its face value, Enron's network is not any more interesting than  networks of other players their size.  The master plan National carrier Enron cites four building blocks as the foundation for its  content distribution service: NETWORK COVERAGE: 12-POP-strong national network and partner agreements with  10 ISPs worldwide - a content distribu-tion network reaching 25 million end  users INTELLIGENCE SOFTWARE: Enron Intelligent Network, which ties together various  network properties for a quality-of-service-enabled offering  BANDWIDTH EXCHANGE SERVICE: Soon to be launched, will provide spot capacity  on other carriers' networks on an on-demand basis  APPLICATION PARTNERS: Vendors and service providers enabling applications  delivered through Enron's network ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________ 11/10/1999  PR Newswire  (Copyright (c) 1999, PR Newswire)     HOUSTON, Nov. 10 /PRNewswire/ -- Enron Communications, a wholly owned  subsidiary of Enron (NYSE: ENE), and Inktomi Corporation (Nasdaq: INKT)  announced today a strategic alliance in which the Inktomi Traffic Server  cache platform will be integrated into the Enron Intelligent Network to offer  high quality network performance and bandwidth capacity to support broadband  content distribution and e-business services. The integration of Inktomi's  caching software into the Enron Intelligent Network enhances Enron  Communications' ability to seamlessly and selectively push content to the  desktop while handling massive volumes of high bit rate network traffic in a  scalable manner.    ""With the acceleration of global e-business demands, there is an increased  need for an Internet infrastructure that is scalable, reliable and fast,""  said David Peterschmidt, President and Chief Executive Officer of Inktomi  Corp."" The integration of our Traffic Server technology into the Enron  Intelligent Network will enable a rich suite of broadband applications and  services targeted at the next generation of content delivery.""   The enhanced performance of the Enron Intelligent Network, in combination  with the Inktomi Traffic Server cache platform, lies in its ability to store  content ""one-hop"" away from the user at the closest ISP server. Enron's  network also provides greater scaling capability to handle peaks in demand  without system failures. In contrast, the public Internet has a limited  capability to deliver broadband services like streaming media, which is often  hampered by packet loss, interference, and other disruptions that slow down  transmission speed and compromise the end user viewing experience.    ""Enron Communications' unique e-business platform includes industrial  strength routers and servers, combined with fiber and satellite distribution,  to deliver more simultaneous streams which overcomes the challenges of the  current Internet,"" said Mike Ortega, vice president of sales at InterNAP.  ""Integrating Inktomi's technology with the Enron Intelligent Network really  takes our services to a new level and provides a huge competitive advantage  in the delivery of broadband content to our customers.""    The integration of Inktomi technology with the Enron Intelligent Network will  represent an industry-best end-to-end solution to deliver mission critical  applications to vertical industries like financial services and media and  entertainment. For example, the Enron Intelligent Network can host high-  quality streaming video road shows for the financial services industry --  distributed live, interactive and on-demand. The Enron Intelligent Network  offers investment banks, content aggregators and other financial entities a  richer, faster and more reliable audio/video experience for their audiences  than today's popular solutions, which are mostly public Internet based.    ""Enterprise businesses are looking for the right combination of technology  that will enable their swift transformation to e-businesses, which is what  the Enron Intelligent Network offers. We offer the end-to-end Internet  solution for content distribution, not just a small enhancement to the public  Internet,"" said Joe Hirko, president and CEO of Enron Communications. ""The  enterprise seeks online services like TV-quality streaming rich media, video  conferencing over the Internet, and large video file transfers over IP, which  are transmitted with even higher quality and reliability over the Enron  Intelligent Network with the support of Inktomi caching.""    One of Enron Communications' streaming customers -- Countrycool.com, the  official web cast site of the 1999 Country Music Association (CMA) Awards --  transmitted a live stream of the 33rd Annual CMA Awards over the Enron  Intelligent Network. The viewing audience connected to the stream at  broadband speeds of 150 Kbps and 300 Kbps. High-bit rate, data-intensive  streaming media events, like the CMA Awards web cast, highlight the efficient  delivery and robust performance of the Enron Intelligent Network.    ""We realized that Enron Intelligent Network was the perfect platform for the  most efficient and reliable delivery of our premier streaming event, and in  fact, they exceeded our expectations. The quality of this stream got such  excellent reviews that our web site audience has increased by nearly 900  percent over last year's numbers,"" said Carol Walcoff, Countrycool.com  President and CEO. ""Now add Inktomi's caching technology to Enron  Communications' platform and we truly are able to scale our services and meet  our increased user requests for on-demand content.""

This document is a compilation of questions from past exams, and is much longer than any single exam. Plausible midterm questions  are marked with a *. Many of the questions were relevant in a given year; thus,  the year of the exam is sometimes included in [brackets].   Short Answer: True, False, or Uncertain, and Why? The grade you receive  depends solely on the quality of your explanation. If you are not sure of what the question assumes, simply state your own assumptions clearly, and answer based on these assumptions.  * 1. [10] The US unemployment rate would decline rapidly if unemployment insurance were cut.  2. [10] The rate of growth of M1 and M2 have both been fairly rapid recently (Assume this sentence is true.) Thus, we can expect that the inflation rate will soon increase rapidly. [1991]  3. [10] In the late seventies the US had both high inflation and relatively high unemployment. Thus, the Phillips' curve theory is wrong, since it predicts  that inflation and unemployment are negatively related.  4. [10] Recently Canada has informally maintained a fixed exchange rate with the US. (This sentence is true.) As long as they target exchange rates, monetary  policy will not be effective in Canada. (You may want to refer to Canadian and US dollars as C$'s and US$'s in your answer.)  5. [10] If the Japanese would lower their interest rates to expand their aggregate demand, then Japanese purchases of US goods would increase. [Hint: Consider  the exchange rate.]  6. [10] ""Why is our money ever less valuable? Perhaps it is simply that we  have inflation because we expect inflation, and we expect inflation because we've had it."" (Robert M. Solow, Technology Review, Dec/Jan 1979: 31)  7. [10] The current U.S. Federal Government Budget Deficit (BD) is not a problem in the short run (i.e., this year). [1992]  8. [10] Fiscal policy is less effective in France than in the United States. [Hint: Consider differences both in the open-economy multiplier and the exchange rate regime.]  9. [10] Low-wage countries such Greece and Portugal will gain more from the creation on a common market than will high-wage countries such as Germany and Denmark. [1993]  * . [10] True unemployment is above measured unemployment.  * 11. [10] We should not worry much about inflation.  * 12. [10] The multiplier is higher when marginal tax rates, marginal savings  rates, and marginal propensity to import are all high.  * 13. [10] Budget deficits in a recession are a good thing.  * 14. [10] For each dollar of revenue lost to the government, capital gains  tax cuts are less effective at spurring investment than are increases in the investment tax credit.  * 15. [10] The federal government should increase spending on education.  * 16. [10] Unions are responsible for a significant fraction of U.S. unemployment. [1994]  17. [10] Free trade hurts American workers, but helps workers in low-wage nations.  18. [10] It is good for the nation when monetary policy accommodates fiscal policy.  * 19. [10] Frictional unemployment represents people rationally choosing to search for a job. Thus, no government policy is called for to address it.  * 20. [10] European unemployment rates and unionization rates are both above U.S. levels, proving unions cause unemployment. [1994]  21. [10] In class we assumed money demand depended on output and interest  rates (L = kY - hi). In the IS-LM framework, when the demand for money (k) increases at any given level of output, output and interest rates will rise.  22. [10] A balanced budget rule (so long as it corrected for cyclical factors) would be a good thing.  23. [10] Increasing consumption increases output. (Hint: Is this a trick question?)  24. [10] In an open economy, monetary policy is less effective than in a  closed economy.  * 25. [10] No policy can cost-effectively reduce the rate of long-term unemployment.  26. [10] Because the stock market falls when output and employment rise, the market is not a good predictor of future output growth.  27. Japan will grow faster than Russia next year. [1995]  * 28. Japan will grow faster than Russia over the next 15 years. [1995]  29. Russian inflation will decline next year. [1995]  30. The creation of the EMU will reduce Italian long-term interest rates. [1996]  31. The process of qualifying for the EMU has reduced French economic growth. [1996]  [10] ""A Booming Economy Made it All Much Easier: For the Shrinking Deficit, Thank the Economy."" [New York Times, 1997]  [10] The recent actions of the Labour government concerning the Central Bank should lower expected inflation in the United Kingdom. [1997]  [10] The recent appreciation of the U.S. dollar is bad for Argentine. [1997]  [10] Ireland should join the European Monetary Union. [Hints: Ireland's  economy is closely tied to Europe but most closely to the United Kingdom; Irish inflation has historically been above the EC average; the Irish economy has been growing rapidly for several years and is likely approaching the output level associated with the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment; and the Irish currency has been near the top of its permissible band of fluctuation against other European countries.] [1997]  [10] ""Investors give East Europe a miss: Problems with legal system, taxes, crime and corruption deter foreign funds."" [Financial Times, 1997]  [10] The EMU should include Italy. [1997]  [10] The multiplier is higher when marginal tax rates, marginal savings rates, the marginal propensity to import are all low and the investment accelerator is high.  * [10] The government should subsidize private savings.  * [10] The capital gains tax should cut, but only if it is reformed.  * [10] The government should subsidize student loans for college.  Longer answers  32. [26] In 1990 the strange and wonderful nation of Bezerkly could best be modelled with the following one-sector model of a closed economy:  Y = C + I + G C = C0 + c Y = 50 + .8 Y I = I0 + fY = 50 + .1 Y G = G0 = 100  This model differs from the standard textbook model because when sales  increase by $1, Bezerk investors see that they need new factories, and investment  increases by $f, where the parameter f is between zero and one.  a) [8] Derive the government spending multiplier in this model either symbolically or numerically. Compare it to multiplier when f = 0. (Recall that if f= 0, then the multiplier in this model dY/dG = 1/(1-b) = 1/(1-.8) =  5. To help you with your arithmetic, Y = 2000 in the example above.)  b) [8] Explain in words the intuition behind the comparison of the two multipliers.  c) [10] What happens to output if G0 falls to 90? What happens to national savings? Show national savings (S - gov't deficit)=I after the shock.  33. [20] As time passed the Telegraph was invented and brought news from the outside world about the wonderful concept of money. Soon thereafter money is introduced into the Bezerker economy, undoubtedly by some non-politically correct dean or economist.  In addition, repetitive drumming in by microeconomics, finance, accounting and macroeconomics professors convinces managers to pay attention to interest  rates when choosing how much to invest. Now the nation is best modelled with the  following IS-LM model of a closed economy:  C = C0 + cY = 50 + .8 Y I = I0 + fY - bi = 50 + .1 Y - i G = G0 = 100 L = kY - hi = Y - 10i Money demand M/P = 1800 Money supply  A. Derive the formulae for the IS curve and the LM curves. (Don't use numbers for this question.)  B. What are the equilibrium levels of income and interest rate? (Do use  numbers for this question.)  34. [30] While in class we focussed on fixed vs. flexible exchange rates, many nations have intermediate cases. For example, some nations have band, where rates are fixed plus or minus some percent. For example, a nation may fix its rates at 10  pesos per dollar plus or minus 4 percent, thus fixing between 9.6 and 10.4 pesos per dollar. In other cases the fixed rate has a crawl built into it: We fix at 10 pesos to  the dollar, depreciating 1 percent per month. Other nations combine the two: a band each month, with built-in depreciation over time. What are the advantages and  disadvantages of these hybrid systems compared to pure fixed rates?  [30] After evaluating all other relevant arguments for and against adoption of a fixed currency, policymakers in the small open economy of Haasland are still undecided. The costs seem to exactly equal the benefits. The last piece of information they are to consider is that Haasland has historically been subject to more shocks of consumer and investor confidence than supply or price shocks. Given this fact and the  desire of Haasland policymakers to stabilize output, what exchange rate policy would you recommend? [Hint: Make reference to IS-LM diagrams in which you show the  effect on output and interest rates of a negative shock to the IS curve (consumer or investor confidence) and a negative shock to the LM curve (supply or price shock) under both fixed and floating exchange rates.]  [30] In 1984, the small open economy of New Zealand had a policy of  maintaining a fixed exchange rate. Suddenly, due to a political crisis, the risk premium for investment in New Zealand increased dramatically. Policymakers were left with two  options: 1) raise interest rates or 2) devalue the currency. Recommend a response based on an analysis of the impact of these policies on output, interest rates and inflation, making reference to an IS-LM diagram.

Since we expect this to be  repurchased, I will talk to CCSI and see if they will waive this.  3)  It is not unusual to insert language to address the event that the  referenced index no longer exists (over the next 14 years).

Sara Shackleton is negotiating directly with  CCSI's counsel with respect to CCSI's requested comments, but there are two  issues raised by the markup that are not strictly lawyer comments that need  to be addressed in order to finalize the confirmation.   One comment CCSI made was to request some type of collateral deposit if ENA's  credit quality slipped in the future. You will recall that the spark spread  should be  repurchased by September 30,1999, pursuant to the option  repurchase agreement, well in advance of the 2003 effective date of the spark  spread. Nevertheless, to make the spark spread appear arms length ( which it  most certainly is!), in view of the theoretical effectiveness of the spark  spread and its 2016 expiration date, CCSI decided it needed credit  protection.   In the course of negotiating the changes to the spark spread, we tendered to  CCSI for its consideration a bilateral collateral deposit agreement, wherein  each party would be required to deposit collateral if credit quality fell in  the future. Unless ENA allows CCSI to pay the spark spread premium in  installments, the credit protection would only apply to ENA since it is the  only party making payments after the effective date, and if the installment  payment request by CCSI is rejected successfully, the form will need to be  amended to apply unilaterally to ENA ( assuming we agree to give CCSI this  comfort).  The form of collateral deposit provision requires that we define an ""Exposure  Threshold"" for ENA that triggers its obligation to provide credit support in  the form of collateral for CCSI's benefit. Normally, the calculation of an  appropriate amount would be done by credit. I understand from Sara, however,  that credit is no longer involved in this deal and that perhaps Randy can  suggest who might be the appropriate person to determine an appropriate  ""Exposure Threshold"" amount for ENA in this context. Of course, if the CCSI  premium is paid in installments, we would need to calculate an appropriate  CCSI ""Exposure Threshold"" as well.  The second issue in the CCSI revisions that the lawyers do not feel  comfortable unilaterally addressing appears in the ""Gas Daily Price""  definition under Cash Settlement Amount. Here,CCSI's counsel has suggested,  if the measures for determining Gas Daily Price should change, that vague  alternative measures be used to define the Gas Daily Price. I'm not sure  whether we are comfortable with what an alternative measure may yeild, and  may want an alternative process if the current measures disappear, or may  have in mind more definite alternatives.

I am correct in understanding there can be different versions of the   Password Agreement and Electronic Trading Agreement?  I have seen Password  Agreement NA Version 1and an Electronic Trading Agreement Version 1 that both  have Enron North America Corp and/or its affiliates as the Enron contracting  party.  In Australia we will have to enter into  electricity derivatives  through the Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd.(EAF)  which is the only Enron  entity authorised trade in these products. Would EAF also be a party to a  Password Agreement and ETA with its potential counterparties? If  I  was starting with a clean sheet in drafting GTCs for Australian  financial power trades I would incorporate into it the  1992 ISDA Master  Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)and as well as the 1993 Commodity  Definitions. This is what Australian counterparties would expect to see.  However, I notice this approach has not been followed with any of the GTCs I  have seen. The closest is the incorporation  EFA terms  for the UK power  contracts. I suppose this raises a general question are there any established  protocols for drafting GTCs?  Small point - I notice the limitation of liability clauses in all the  documentation follows the US form.  I notice even for contracts interpreted  under English law there is an exclusion of ""special damages"".  In Australia  and I thought England special damages were defined money damages that must be  specially damages as opposed to general damages such as pain and suffering  that cannot be quantified and are assessed by the court. This is completely  different  to the meaning of this term in US. Has this issue been considered  and for whatever reason a decision has been made to go with the US wording?   How much work have we done on issues such as those relating to formation of  contracts? I note it was excluded from the scope of your surveys of the  various European jurisdictions. I am taking my brief to include those issues  relevant which are material to ensure that Enron is complying with the law  and will also have enforceable agreement. This may go wider than just  regulatory compliance issues.   If you prefer give me a call to discuss 612 9229 2310.

2022-04-06 16:25:31+00:00,false,6,"  Enron rings opening bell for bandwidth      exchange       By Corey Grice      Staff Writer, CNET News.com      December 2, 1999, 5:40 p.m. PT        The opening bell has rung for a new kind of exchange. The currency?  Bandwidth.        A subsidiary of energy industry giant Enron, Enron Communications, today  opened the      doors to a bandwidth commodity exchange. The company first announced its  intention to      sell space on high-speed networks as a commodity in May.                               Traditional commodity exchanges sell goods like  oil, natural                             gas and grain. Enron has taken this concept and  given it a                             telecommunications spin, offering space on  high-speed                             networks to communications carriers.                              In the past, carriers looking to fill holes or  service gaps in                             their networks would have had to enter long-term  contracts                             with other carriers to fulfill their bandwidth  needs. The                             exchange, Enron says, acts as a sort of middleman  for                             carriers to find short-term contracts or quick  fixes as they                             complete network construction or try to manage                             heavier-than-expected network traffic.                               For example, Global Crossing plans to sell  capacity on a                             high-speed fiber optic link between New York and  Los                             Angeles over the exchange.       Enron also expects to start an international bandwidth trading market  next May.       Separately, RateXchange, a similar bandwidth exchange, demonstrated its  own      commodities trading system at a telecommunications conference in New  York today.        RateXchange predicts that the trading of bandwidth and other  telecommunications products      could become a $8 billion market by 2002.

Unsure that the= =20 bill would provide adequate privacy protections for financial records, stat= es=20 began hashing out the issue, investigating consumer privacy and launching= =20 committees dedicated to exploring options. Those efforts have proven=20 fruitful. With privacy advocates lamenting the final results in S. 900, the= =20 pressure is seeping into the states to protect personal information.

Now, they hope to see that typ= e=20 of policy enacted in the states.=20 =09Building A Framework  ?????There are a handful of states that already had begun work in the priva= cy=20 arena. One is Minnesota, which catapulted itself into the national privacy= =20 spotlight in June when Attorney General Mike Hatch launched an investigatio= n=20 and lawsuit against U.S. Bank for giving out personal financial information= =20 to a telemarketing company. The telemarketers, after calling customers and= =20 inquiring whether they wanted additional information about bank services,= =20 charged the customers for the services.

Under the settlement, the bank= =20 donated over $2 million to charities around the state and agreed to make=20 refunds to Minnesota customers who were victims of the scheme. It also=20 enacted an opt-out policy, among other penalties. Minnesota was one of the= =20 most outspoken opponents of the federal legislation, saying that it ""was ev= en=20 weaker than the settlement we got,"" according to Hatch's press secretary,= =20 Leslie Sandburg.=20 ?????Consumers Union's David Butler called Minnesota ""as proactive as any= =20 state at this point"" for their prosecution of U.S. Bank, but added that ""th= is=20 is still a relatively new debate at the state level.""=20 ?????Some observers anticipate that with the passage of the federal ""bank= =20 bill,"" states may become more alert to the issues at hand. ""This will force= =20 states to look directly at the issue,"" said Brett Hester, the National=20 Governors' Association's economic development policy analyst. John Ryan, of= =20 the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, agreed. ""It's a hot issue, an=20 easily political issue,"" he said. ""You have elected officials who may want = to=20 make an issue out of this."" Minnesota, taking advantage of the Sarbanes=20 amendment, will introduce legislation next session to the tune of protectin= g=20 consumer privacy.=20 ?????Also at the fore is Massachusetts' Lieutenant Gov.

In a recent speech, Swift railed against the federal=20 legislation, saying that both Congress and the administration missed out on=  a=20 historic opportunity to ensure privacy protections.

Also, does the presence of > a currency board versus having a central bank make a difference?  This is > especially confusing in understanding the effects of Argentina peggin to the > dollar and it's impact......   First pegged exchange rates are the same as fixed exchange rate.  A currency board goes further by promising by law that you will not change the fixed rate (ie devalue).  In reality, r = r* does not hold perfectly.  It is a simplification which we use to explain why under a fixed exchange rate system monetary policy is inneffective...that there would be infinite capital flows to the country with a higher interest rate.  I would read through Mankiw p 315 to 318 for a discussion on the risk premium which addresses your question.  Now, the situations you refer to where a country chooses between devaluation or raising interest rates occurs because a country is drawing down its foreign reserves and despite the fat that r = r*, money is flowing out. You can think of this as the introduction of a risk premium, theta.  So that r = r* + theta. So r must now be raised in order to preserve the capital flow equilibrium.  Without foreign reserves the central bank cannot honor the fixed exchange rate.  Its choices then are either to raise the interest rates sharply to preserve the currency or to devalue thereby raising net exports and making it more expensive for foreigners to sell the domestic currency (ie pesos) for dollars.  In the Mexico example in Mankiw, the country did not raise rates and was eventually forced to devalue.  Often the idea is that a country should take the step to devalue before it is in a crisis situation if it is not willing to cause a recession to keep the exchange rate fixed.  This is what the IMF advised the Asian countries months before the crisis.  They did not want to because of credibility issues and fears that devaluing itself might precipitate a crisis and raise the risk premium.  The problem is that if you wait too long it becomes a fate accompli.  A currency is advocated by some because it replaces the central bank with ""a cash register"" and solves the credibility issue.  The main drawback is that you may have to cause a recession to honor your exchange rate.","A couple of people have asked me similar questions that I'm not sure I wanted to spend a lot of time on tomorrow, but that others would probably find interesting. > In class we talked about how monetary policy had no discretion when interest rates are fixed (they essentially have to follow the lead of"

2022-04-06 06:34:34+00:00,true,6,"  Louise - thanks for forwarding.  Preliminary response as follows (I will need  to follow up with Sanjev at Slaughter and May who is co-ordinating the  European side):  1.  Regulation  We agree with the analysis. Securities laws will not be relevant.  Insurance  is likey to be the main issue.  If it emerges from our legal review of the  relevant countries that we can avoid the insurance point by making our  contracts look like derivatives (swaps/options) that will determine whether  the CFTC (commodity) regulations will be relevant.  For this reason, it makes  sense to complete the survey before drafting the confirms (which in any event  will be fairly simple). Note, though, that we will not be using ISDA  documentation, since it is unnecessarily complex for the product contemplated  (described below) and using the GTCs approach will tie in more neatly with  OnLine.    Of course we will also need to look at local regulation in each target  jurisdiction.  SFA, for example, are taking an increased interest in the  internet and have recently released a detailed questionnaire which we may  need to complete before launch.  2.  The Product  From my most recent discussions with Bryan, the product will be a simple  Bankruptcy only, digital payout.  That is, if the reference entity goes  bankrupt (probably as defined under the laws of its jurisdiction of  incorporation - local counsel will need to draft in each case) the protection  seller will pay the buyer a fixed, pre-agreed sum of money (not determined by  reference to the value of a bond or anything else).  3.  Bankruptcy  Please see 2 above.  Also note that we are looking for a harder (more  certain) definition of bankruptcy which will be relatively easy to ascertain  in each case.  Early warning type events will probably be out and court based  or other formal proceedings which are readily verifiable will be in. In  practice, this will make it harder for the buyer to claim than under the ISDA  definition (for example) which is a far softer and more sensitive trigger.  4.  Confidentiality  Ken also raised this important point when we spoke yesterday.  There are  issues of confidentiality which will be relevant.  While as a matter of UK  regulation, a Chinese Wall/Restricted List procedure will not be required  (since no securities will be involved), contractual duties of confidentiality  will need to be considered.  The issue is perhaps more a commercial one - We will need to think carefully  about the impact our public betting on the bankruptcy of our counterparties  will or might have on our business relationships with them.  I'll come back with a ""legal game plan"" once Bryan, Sanjev and I have got  together.

BONY is getting a legal opinion on the ADR issuance and is in contact with  Millenium's attorneys.  2. DKB has performed investigations on whether these ADRs must be restricted,  DKB's view is that they should not restricted.  This is highly arcane US SEC  law (so my summary is probably missing a lot of finer points), but my  understanding is that DKB views the sale of the local shares as a real sale,  with a public notice, a public underwritten auction etc,and there is nothing  restricted about the shares.  I don't think BONY would dispute that, but I  think their interpretation (and our legal view) is that the shares are  restricted because they are shares that were not registered with the SEC  under the original ADR issuance and, critically, they were sold by the  ""Issuer"".   That is, BONY's view is that BNDES is the same as Millenium b/c  they are both government entities--ie BNDES is the ""Issuer"".  Therefore,  regardless of the public nature of sale of the shares (and the fact that the  shares aren't restricted for trading locally in Brazil), the shares issued as  ADRs would be restricted per US law.  Now, ultimately we have to go with what BONY says b/c they issue the ADRs.   However, before we charge back to BONY and argue DKB's case, I would  appreciate a review by Skadden back to me on whether these shares if issued  as ADRs would be restricted.  We want unrestricted, NYSE ADRs if possible.  3. When the ADRs are issued, they will be issued to PEP, a Brazil company,  but deposited in one of the CayCo parents of PEP custody account.  We will  need to check Brazil law and revise our MS custody account accordingly to se  eif we can do this.  Sara, again I will try to call tomorrow, I apologize for  the delay.  4. The plan to move the ADRs out of Brazil is as follows. There will be no  sale and no cash movement.  There may be a CPMF.  PEP will perform an  ""in-kind"" capital reduction of the shares back to its CayCo parent.  This  will probably require some Brazil government approvals (or may not).  If so,  what are they and how long will they take?  5. Critically, we have been advised by Brazil legal and by US tax that the  shares if moved in this manner will move at the ORIGINAL COST BASIS.  IE,  there is no taxbale event for US or Brazil.  Lynn, please confirm.  6. I don't have a timetable yet, I will call BONY tomorrow for an update on  timing.

I think we will use MS as custodian (assuming account contemplates holding  physical, restricted securities--Sara, I will speak with you about this).  5. Theresa has calls in to Millenium to get ""ok"" and also is working to get  legal opinion issued on issuing restricted ADRs pursuant to original ADR  documentation (if I udnerstand the issue correctly).  6.  Once the shares are transferred, we will seek to do an ""in-kind"" capital  reduction at the PEP level up to its CayCo parent and hopefully avoid any  CPMF.

From  tax standpoint, Lynn has determined that if we move the shares via a  capital reduction, there will be no Brazil or US tax (other than perhaps a  CPMF) since we will move the shares at their original basis.  So the price  doesn't matter too much--but I don't want to take any chances with the Brazil  tax authorities.  Better to move the shares now when the price is pretty even  than to move it later when the price has doubled; it would be a tempting tax  target.

2022-04-06 19:23:56+00:00,true,6,"  I've finished marking up the drafts, and thought perhaps a few thoughts would  give you some insight into the reasons for my revisions . Unfortunately, I  was engaged in discussions about the course to pursue in light of Arthur  Anderson's comments until almost 10pm, when I lost my typing help, so not  much headway was made in inputting the changes last night. My secretary is  supposed to be in early ( it is now nearly 8:00 and she still isn't in ! ),  and I will enlist whatever other help I can get to turn these documents  around.  For those not involved in the discussions last night, Roger advised us that  Arthur Anderson had changes to the Xonon Technology Implementation Agreement  designed to make clear ENA had no primary or secondary obligations under the  XTIA. The principal change suggested by AA - the deletion of the last  sentence of the BOLD language in Section 2.2 - removed the obligation for ENA  to pick up any obligations under the agreement owed by West LB in excess of  the ""Cap"". Note that this same change applies in the Agreement in Principle  related to the purchase of turbines.   XTIA Revision 4G.  AA's change did not appear to address comprehensively the  principle AA espoused, ie, clarifying ENA had no primary or secondary  obligations under the agreements. After much discussion and some  consideration, I decided to prepare alternative markups of the XTIA - one  that attempts to meet the AA directive while preserving a level of comfort  for GE. I attempted this by increasing the limit on West LB's liability in  Article 10 to $20 million from $9.9 million so that GE's recourse against  West LB is the same as it had against West LB and ENA in the prior drafts,  and by obligating West LB, in the default provisions, to pony up for an ENA  default. I also extensively modified the Section 2.2 language ( taken  verbatim from the LM 6000 deal ) to eliminate the limited recourse provisions  favoring West LB, and in doing so made it easier to conclude that references  to ENA in the agreement are references to ENA acting in an agency, and not  its individual capacity. This notion is still pretty vague in the revision  because I did not want to create too much discomfort in GE, since ENA  explicitly acting in an agency capacity would mean there was no recourse  against it ( since ultimate recourse would lie with the principal, West LB).  Roger suggested I delete the limit on ENA's liability in Article 10 to remove  the implication it had any, which I did ( and which means we have no upside  protection if we are construed to have obligations under the XTIA.  The upshot is that in my opinion the 4g revision goes as far as possible  toward placating AA while still retaining a possibility of selling it to GE.  The sheer number of changes required by the substance of AA's comment,  however, is bound to be disconcerting to GE at this stage of negotiations,  particularly when GE's expectation was for a  markup incorporating the new  business terms agreed yesterday afternoon (calling for payment of the  Development Funds to be completed by September 30,2000, with the possibility  of a refund of a portion of the Development Fund Payment if the December 31  Milestone is not timely completed) and some clean ups/clarifications.  Note that in both revision 4g and 4ga, Section4.3 now provides that the Xonon  credit created is only exercisable by CCSI on and after December 31,2000, so  that the credit amount can reflect the deduction of any Milestone 4 refund  amount paid by GE if it does not complete that Milestone on time. I think the  dollar value of the credit should be adjusted downward if a portion of the  Development Funds paid on September 30 are in fact refunded in December. We  need to make sure to make provision in the Acquisition and Development  Agreement that any Milestone 4 refund received by West LB is paid over to  ENA, since West LB will have been repaid its advances on September 30,2000.  XTIA Revision 4GA . This alternate revision to the XTIA takes a minimalist  approach, and incorporates only the new business terms, some minor clean  up/clarifications, and the AA change to Section 2.2 and the change to Article  10 ( to remove a cap for ENA's laibility) suggested by Roger. It seems to me  it does not address meaningfully the AA admonition that ENA may not have  primary or secondary liability under the XTIA if it wants to stay outside of  the rigors of FAS 97-10. However, it has the singular advantage of looking a  lot like what GE and West LB expect to see in the revision.  Option Repurchase Agreement. This revision was complicated by the possible  refund of the a portion of the Development Funds by GE if it failed to  complete Milestone 4 by December 31,2000 ( an attempt to retain some  accountability for GE's performance given that it is being paid for that  Milestone on September 30 to satisfy CCSI ). Because the option repurchase  must occur on or before September 30, it isn't clear what will happen  December 31, so its hard to figure out what to pay if the contract is not  cancelled by September 30 or what the credits are worth on that date.   Since CCSI is the direct recipient of the credits under the XTIA, I first  thought ENA could hang onto  $2.1 million ( the amount formerly allocated to  Milestone 4 before its payment obligation was collapsed into Milestone 3) by  deducting the refund from the amount payable  to CCSI on the option  repurchase date and leaving CCSI to bear the risk of GE's repayment of any  refund in order to make CCSI whole. If GE did meet the Milestone on time and  so did not pay the refund amount directly to CCSI, I thought ENA could always  make CCSI whole by paying the $2.1 million  in December when the refund  matter was decided. That approach- subtracting the refund amount from the  September 30 payment to CCSI- was decidedly unsatisfactory since the option  repurchase formula could result - depending on the Milestones paid on the  option repurchase date - in a negative payment to CCSI for the option.   What I settled on in this draft was to go ahead and pay CCSI the amount of  the premiums it has paid to September 30 plus $200,000 if the turbine  contract has not been cancelled on September 30. This would include repayment  to CCSI on September 30 of premiums paid by CCSI under the spark spread on  September 30. Assuming CCSI made all its premium payments and West LB made  all of its Development Fund advances, ENA would have received $9.9 million  from CCSI by September 30, paid out $9.9 million plus interest to West LB by  September 30, and purchased the spark spread from CCSI for $10.1 million. If  the turbine contract is not cancelled but GE has to pay the refund, I think  the $2.1 million ought to go to West LB or its designee (ENA).  If we cancel the turbine contract and do not go forward with Pastoria, the  dollar amount of the credits vested in CCSI  and exercisable after December  31,2000, are equal to the Development Funds advanced less the refund amount.   Since the document now reads that the $2.1 refund amount goes back to West LB  or its designee, if GE pays the refund and CCSI is holding a  Xonon credit of  only $7.8 million,it seems to me it will be necessary  to pay the refund over  to CCSI instead of ENA in order to make up for the fact that it paid $9.9 in  premium and only received $7.8 in credit in September. This quick  ""liquidation"" of $2.1 of the credit seems to be an ancillary benefit to CCSI  occasioned by GE's refund. We could provide in the agreements that GE makes  this payment directly to CCSI or we can continue to have the right to receive  the payment from GE under the XTIA and the obligation to pay it to CCSI under  the Repurchase Agreement.","I've finished marking up the drafts, and thought perhaps a few thoughts would give you some insight into the reasons for my revisions.

As  you can see, the tax impact of each option depends the specific set of facts  as to how Enron is operating its trading activity.  Of particular importance  is the concept  that the US will tax the earnings of foreign jurisdictions  even if there are no US employees involved in the transactions to the extent  a US affiliate of Enron is deemed to be providing substantial assistance to  the foreign entity that is involved in the financial trading activities.    The current structure for financial trading in Argentina is the most tax  efficient based upon the way Enron has chosen to conduct its business.  The  earnings are limited to a single layer of tax in the US.  To the extent that  the Sao Paulo office develops into an operation that can fully support all  trading activity so that there is no support from the US, we may be able to  restructure the operations to provide more flexibility to the traders in  South America.  Even if we shift the activity to a Brazilian entity,  the  traders will have to follow guidelines to avoid taxation in Argentina as well.

This is another indication that a 'travel policy' for travelers  to Colombia should be in effect.  What happened to the one we were discussing  earlier?  The steps outlined there would go a long way in improving the  security of our travelers.  Control Risks' report discusses responses to the media - be sure you have the  approval of Enron's media people before making any response.  The report also recommends suspending bidding on new projects - probably not  viable advice, but reinforces the importance that additional security  measures be built into all new projects from day one.  Now that our name is in front of the Colombian public, we could see  retaliation for various acts, not all of which we have control over.  Recent  US Government actions such as extraditing criminals to the US for trial and  training Colombian anti-drug troops have done little to endear American  businesses to the Colombian public, who see such actions as interfering with  Colombia's right to govern themselves.  These actions have significantly  raised the risk of all American companies and their employees in Colombia.  A meeting I had about two years ago with David Beddow of Control Risks in  Bogota indicated that we could see some changes in the methods of attack in  urban areas by FARC/ELN.  With an elevated risk level, we should begin  thinking about these threats.  FARC seldom uses the car bomb method of attack  because it generates little interest among the domestic or international  media.  FARC plans on using letter bombs mailed to select targets, i.e., head  of an American-owned corporation who may have an office in Bogota.  This  method will generate headlines in the press and generate a fear of FARC among  businessmen who may be targets.  Control Risks' reported timetable for this  change in FARC's tactics was to be three to five years, but now that our risk  is higher, the timetable may well be moved up.  On a related note - did you employ the security person we recommended?  Please let me know how I can help you.

Transactions of money and trade will less expensive because currency exchange cost will disappear.  Saves the costs of hedging exchange rate risks (some monetary, others due to the drain on managerial attention) or the risks of not heding fixed but adjustable rates.  Makes price differences more transparent across borders, which may increase trade.  Economists do not fully understand why, but beyond the measurable effects of the effects I just mentioned, a common currency increases trade even more than these slightly lower transaction costs can explain.         The process of qualifying for unification also required lower  inflation and deficits, which many economists and politicians desired.         The main arguments for monetary unifications were political, not economic, having to do with integrating Western Europe.  Q2: Beside losing its monetary authority, what are the reasons that the UK  does not want to join the Euro? I believe the Government has a different opinion than the public. What are these arguments?  As you note, the economic reason is fear of losing control over domestic monetary policy.  As with the decision to join, the UK's decision not to join was largely political, choosing NOT to unify as rapidly with Europe on  monetary and lots of other matters (social charter that may regulate working  conditions, etc.).  Q3: In my notes, I wrote ""You don't get rich by exporting -- you get rich in the short run by importing."" What do you mean?  I said that unclearly.  I should have said, ""You do not raise your standard of living by exporting; you raise it by importing.""  At the same time, exports  are the price of imports, so you raise your grandkids' standard of living by exporting intsead of borrowing to pay for the imports.  (Unless the imports  are high-value investment goods...)  Q4: I also wrote in my notes: ""Trade deficits and exchange rates can't be used to describe a country's prosperity.""  If trade deficits and exch. rates can't be used to describe prosperity, what is the best measure? At first GDP comes  to mind, but in my day 2 notes, there are all sorts of reasons why GDP isn't a good measure, the most poignant one being: ""2 countries have the same GDP, but one country has twice as many people -- this country has lower per capita GDP, and is poorer than the first country.""         CRUX: is per capita GDP a good measure of prosperity?  Per capita is a pretty good measure of prosperity and living standards.  The list we gave are all the components of ""the good life"" it leaves out.  On average, rich nations have higher life expectancy, etc., so GDP per capita is not too misleading, but it clearly can be (as we pointed out).  Thus, no  single measure suffices, and a combination of measures can be useful.    David I.

2022-04-06 06:11:52+00:00,true,6,"  Following up on our discussion yesterday, this is to summarize the issues and  questions that we identified with respect to the trading of credit  derivatives through Enron OnLine:  1.  The proposal needs to be analyzed more closely from the perspective of  three principal regulatory schemes - securities, commodities and insurance.   If the credit derivatives are not priced on the basis of or indexed to  securities, there should not be any significant securities law issues.  With  respect to the Commodity Exchange Act, if the derivatives are executed as  swaps, they will need to satisfy the CFTC's swap exemption and, if executed  as options, they will need to satisfy the trade option exemption.  With  respect to insurance, there could be an issue as to whether the credit  derivatives constitute insurance.  This determination as well will depend  largely on how the derivatives are structured.  For example, how will payment  amounts be determined and will payments be tied to losses actually  experienced  by a counterparty?  2.  As a result of the foregoing, it will be necessary to obtain more details  regarding the structure of the proposed transactions.  Will they be swaps or  options?  What will the precise terms be (and are there any draft forms of  confirms that can be reviewed)?  3.  It will also be necessary to determine how bankruptcy events will be  defined.  This approach is clearly simpler than other forms of credit  derivatives that include a variety of triggers (such as those based on  defaults under loans, derivatives, securities or other instruments), because  bankruptcy should generally be a public and objective event.  However, in  many jurisdictions, it is  possible for third parties to cause an involuntary  bankruptcy proceeding to be commenced and even frivolous proceedings can be  commenced and maintained for some period.  Presumably the definition that is  used will need to provide for some period in which the proceeding might be  dismissed.  Also, the definition will need to take into account the  possibility of non-US bankruptcy proceedings.  4.  We also should obtain more information on the manner in which the  derivatives will be priced and the manner in which such prices will be  published or disseminated to clients.  This goes to the issue of whether  Enron could be found to have breached some duty to a third party or whether  that party may have a claim against Enron on some other basis.  For example, it is possible that an entity whose ""name"" is included in the  list of those on which derivatives are written will claim that Enron  improperly used confidential information that it received about that party  through a trading relationship in pricing derivatives on its credit.  In  addition, such ""name"" might claim that Enron caused it injury by publishing a  price for derivatives on its credit that reflected a weaker credit rating  than was warranted.  That party might claim that, by publishing such price,  Enron caused other parties to suspend trading with it, to declare defaults or  to demand collateral.  This obviously is not generally a problem with credit  derivatives because they are done privately on a one-to-one basis.

Help is now just a click away at http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu/ Book mark it now or, if on site, just type the word =0F""helpdesk=0F"" in the ""Location"" or ""Address"" field of your=  web browser and you'll be immediately transported to the Service Request System= .  It couldn't be simpler=0F. no need for email delays, voice mail or busy signals.  Phoning and email are now completely optional.  Any Haas faculty, staff or student can now open and track his or her own service request on-line.  As you launch the web site, you will need to sign in using your NT login and password.  Once logged in, you can enter a request, check the status of requests, update your helpdesk user profile, view the entire job queue, or check the queue for your department.  The system is intuitive and is described in detail on the homepage.  A brief summary of the request entry process is included below.  What=0F's different about this helpdesk system is that it puts the customer=  in the driver's seat.  You will be able to submit a request, or follow up on a request whenever you need to.  Your request will be captured in the database in your own words so nothing is lost in translation.  The web based system permits you to enter a request from anywhere you have access to a browser, even if your email is not working.

Both Haas Media Services and the Marketing and Communications Web Team have joined HCS in using this system to track their service requests.  Routine service requests will be assigned to a support staff member within one business day of entry.  The person to whom the request is assigned will still be contacting the customer within one business day to initiate problem resolution.  Higher priority requests will receive expedited service.

2022-04-06 22:11:18+00:00,true,6,"  Attached please find the latest versions of the above-referenced documents,  marked to show changes from the versions distributed 12/9, except in the case  of Annexes C ( Guaranty and Indemnification Agreement) and D ( form of the  drawing certificate to the CCSI letter of credit, the complete letter to be  supplied by CCSI on Monday) to Exhibit A to the Option Repurchase Agreement.  I incorporated the Guaranty and Indemnification Agreement and form of drawing  certificate as received from CCSI counsel on Friday night into version 7f in  order that our revisions to these documents would be reflected in these  marked versions.The changes are summarized as follows:  Xonon Technology Implementation Agreement.  Section 4.1 was modified at  Brad's request to clarify the payment provisions, and to clarify that the  Milestone 4 Refund Amount is not intended to be an exclusive remedy( ie,  liquidated damages provision) with respect to the failure to complete  Milestone 4 or subsequent Milestones or other obligations. Section 4.2 was  modified, at the request of West LB, to cause West LB not to be involved in  any decision to revise the milestones. Section 9.2 (b) was revised to delete  an incorrect reference to Texas law in arbitration ( more consistent with  fact that New York law applies to the agreement) and the insert in (iii) was  made to reflect that selection of arbitrators is dealt with in (a) and should  not be overriden by any supplemental procedures of the AAA. Section 11.2 was  modified to add a reference to Article 10 ( to make clear the survival of  pending claims at 12/31/06 provision in that Article was not in conflict with  Section 11.2). All other changes were pretty self evident clarifications or  corrections of typographical errors.   Option Repurchase Agreement. Remember that Annexes A and B to Exhibit A are  in a separate document because of format and need to be inserted in behind  Exhibit A and before Annex C. Section 1.1 of the Agreement was revised to  clarify that the Paid Premium amount payable by ENA was such amount at the  Option Repurchase Date, to correct a date reference to the date the Milestone  4 Refund Amount becomes payable by GE, to clarify that the vested value of  the Xonon Credits equal to the Paid Premium applies in the assignment of  credits to ENA pursuant to Section 1.2, and to clarify that ENA may withhold  from the Milestone 4 Refund Amount payable to CCSI any unpaid premium plus  any other amounts owed by CCSI to ENA ( eg, legal expenses incurred by ENA in  seeking to collect Unpaid Premium).  Section 2.2 was revised to add a new defined term ""Operative Agreements"" to  refer to the Exhibits and Annexes to the Agreement and the notion of  Operative Agreements was worked into Section 2.2 to make it clear that ENA  was released from its obligations under the Confirmantion and Guaranty ( if  any, since it is a party) when released from the Agreement. Section 2.2 also  makes clear that ENA cannot assign rights under Section 7.2 of the Xonon  Agreement to CCSI ( consistent with the limitations on ENA's rights in  Section 4.5 of the Xonon Agreement).  Article 3 was amended to incorporate the Operative Agreements into the  representations and warranties of the parties.  Article 4 was revised to clarify that the 30 day cure period did not apply to  failures to pay the Premium Payment installments and to add nonpayment under  the Guaranty or failure by the bank to advance funds under the Letter of  Credit upon presentation of a proper drawing certificate as Events of Default  outside the cure period.  The bankruptcy  Event of Default was modified to  incorporate the bankruptcy of the guarantor, Catalytica , Inc.  Article 5 was modified to incorporate the Operative Agreements so we have  consistent assignment terms.  Article 7 indemnification now applies for Catalytica's default under the  guaranty.  Article 9 was modified to make clear all the Operative Agreements must be in  place for the Option Repurchase Agreement to become effective, and Article 10  incorporates the Operative Agreements so that we have consistent terms for  the miscellaneous provisions.Since the confidentiality agreement was never  signed, Section 10.8 has been supplemented to include some of the key  concepts from the proposed confidentiality agreement, including CCSI's  requested modification that disclosure not be made to any person without  consent unless the person had agreed to confidentiality restrictions as least  as stringent as those in Section 10.8.  The changes to the Guaranty and Indemnification Agreement are intended to  clarify that ENA is not  required to make demand under the Guaranty before  proceeding to collect under the letter of credit, and to clarify that the  condition to payment is CCSI's failure to pay upon a Joint Concurrence.  Similarly, the drawing certificate conditions are limited to those in the  Confirmation and the requirement that there be no Event of Default or  possible event of default is deleted as adding unnecessary ambiguity to the  draw procedures. CCSI will have notice of any such event ( see Section 3.2  (h) of the Option Repurchase Agreement) and ENA will have no incentive to  cause West LB to advance funds if GE is not performing. However, to the  extent West LB may advance and ENA subsequently learn of a default, it is my  understanding CCSI would still have to advance if the Joint Concurrence were  delivered to it. This is consistent with the understanding that the Paid  Premium will mirror in amount and be paid at least concurrently with the West  LB advances under the Xonon Agreement.   The Confirmation is revised to incorporate the change you suggested, although  we need to discuss the cap on the LC since under the Confirmation CCSI is  obligated to pay interest and expenses above the cap. The Confirmation also  eliminates references to a Master Agreement signed in the future to  supplement the terms of the option ( could be disruptive to say the least)  and CCSI's right to object to the terms of the confirm ( unnecessary in this  closely negotiated  transaction).  The other changes are typos or self-evident. If you have any questions let me  know. The legend following the signatures will be removed in the execution  version.

I had been looking  at the cruising guide when I got home last night to see where we might be  able to poke around in the USVI.  I seem to remember that the Moorings won't  let us take the boat to St. Croix (a bit far away) but had thought we might  want to get special permission.  Now I'm not so sure if the place will still  be all ahoo when we get there.  It might not have been the entire group's cup  of tea in any event since it would take a good solid day of sailing each way  to and from St. John.

2022-04-06 06:08:01+00:00,true,6,"  CONFIDENTIAL SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE  Here is a line of argument which we might consider using to muzzle the PX.     1. Section  19.3.1 of the Tariff  requires the PX to keep  sensitive  information given to the PX by Participants Confidential.    2. Section 19.3.3 says no PX Participant has the right to review any  ....  information... that another PX Participant  has designated as confidential.    3.  Section 19.3.4 says that if the PX thinks it has to disclose  information,  it has to let the Participant that will be affected by the  disclosure have time to challenge the alleged disclosure requirement.  4. PX Tariff Schedule 10  (Dealing with Sanctions)  says that the terms of  Section 19 apply in Sanction situations.     5.  Schedule 10 is silent about whether or not the PX is required or  permitted to broadcast Sanctions to the market.    There may be a legal argument based on the Tariff  that the PX has to keep  quiet about sanctions.  Are they required or permitted to broadcast to the  whole world their  findings?     Another line of reasoning based on the Tariff which might be worth exploring   is as follows:   if this event had occurred now,  with the new sanction part  of the  tariff in effect, the PX would have had to have conducted an  investigation in accordance with Section 5.4 which requires the basis of a  finding to be given and, if after this relatively  fair looking due process  section was followed, we were found guilty,   we would have received a Level  1 Sanction,  which is a Formal Warning which ""shall take the form of a  written letter identifying the PX Participant's infraction. ""   and nothing  more.  Therefore,  why is the PX seeking to solve a problem it had before the  Tariff was brought up to date  on Sanctions with a  Kangaroo Court process   that is more draconian than its newly approved FERC sanctions?   It is rather  ironic that we have escaped sanctions because they were't organized to impose  them when the actions in question occurred, but had the present Tariff been  in effect then, we probably would not have been treated so shabbily.  Somehow  this has to be able to be turned into a legal argument in our defence. ---cgy  These are preliminary thoughts which I think merit further pursuit.   ---cgy    ",CONFIDENTIAL SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE.

SUMMARY                      In order to resolve legal uncertainties regarding the  status of over-the-counter (""OTC"") derivatives under the Commodity Exchange Act (the  ""CEA""), Congress requested the President's Working Group on Financial Markets (""PWG"")  to report on, and make recommendations for legislative and regulatory changes  with respect to, such instruments.  On November 9, 1999, the PWG issued its  report, entitled Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets and the Commodity Exchange Act (the  ""Report""), which proposes a number of substantial changes to the CEA and the regulatory  structure for a variety of OTC derivatives.  Subject to the enactment of the  recommended amendments to the CEA and regulations of the CFTC, the Report could substantially  alleviate the legal uncertainty that currently exists with respect to OTC derivatives, thereby  facilitating further growth and development in the markets for such instruments.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ This e-mail is sent by a law firm and contains information that may be  privileged and confidential.

The attached message indicates that PG&E in unable to meet  our schedule requirements for the installation of meters on our generator  relocation project at SFSU.  We have been working since April to try and  ensure this problem would not occur.  PG&E has consistently either not  responded or been slow to respond.  When we did hear back from them, they  always assured us that there would be no problem, but they never made firm  committments in their responses.  Even now they are not providing firm dates.  The delays they are causing will create substantial customer satisfaction  problems, and subjects us to Liquidated Damages of $850 per day.  I have a call into Bob Kinert at PG&E to inform him of our mutual customer  satisfaction issue.  I am hoping he will be able to take action to improve  the schedule.

2022-04-06 22:28:29+00:00,true,6,"  I reviewed the UtilityGuide website and while I do not have an issue with Mr.  van Ulden participating on the advisory board I would have a few cautions. It should not include any hard commitments from Enron in terms of funding.   We may want to participate in the program but we should not be required too. His compensation should be insignificant or nothing.  Otherwise he would have  a conflict as their revenues will come from our competitors.  I would have a  lot of heartburn over that as an Enron representative as well as if I came  from the competition.  Please let me know final status or if you have any questions.      Andrew Wu 12/12/99 07:59 PM To: Jim Badum/HOU/EES@EES cc: Jeff Dasovich/SFO/EES@EES  Subject: Dirk vanUlden  Jim--  I am in the EES Legal Dept here in California.  Jeff Dasovich of Public and  Gov't Affairs asked me to send you an email soliciting your thoughts  regarding Enron employees participating in third-party deregulation-related  companies.  Specifically, an Enron employee here in California (Mr. Dirk van Ulden) has  been asked to serve on the ""advisory board"" for a deregulated industry  startup called UtilityGuide.  UtilityGuide's goal is to create an online  forum for buyers and sellers of deregulated energy services.  UtilityGuide  would be funded by (a) transaction fees paid by services providers, and (b)  revenues derived from advertising and sponsorship.  The management of UtilityGuide includes an ex-White House policy analyst (I  don't know which administration), a web design consultant and former  marketing manager for Greenpeace, and an ex-portfolio manager for Union Bank  of California.  Mr. van Ulden would be one of seven on the advisory board, which does not  include any management activities.  Mr. van Ulden's main duties appear to be  assisting in recruitment of other members of the advisory board, other  management members, and identifying potential sources of working capital.   The term of Mr. van Ulden's appointment would be one year.  Jeff Dasovich and I have reviewed UtilityGuide's website  (www.utilityguide.com) and we do not believe that Mr. van Ulden's service on  the advisory board would be in conflict with the Enron Corporate Conduct  policy, mainly because (a) UtilityGuide as an aggregator of energy servicers  and not an energy service provider itself does not appear to be a competitor  of Enron, and (b) Mr. van Ulden's position at Enron Energy Services as a  project manager under Jeff Messina's Account Management and Delivery group  limits virtually all actual conflicts between Mr. van Ulden's duties at EES  v. his duties at UtilityGuide.  However, because of EES' ongoing forays into  the electronic marketplace, we thought it appropriate to ask your thoughts  before responding.  I believe that Mr. van Ulden has the concurrence of his  management as to this appointment, although of course we can seek concurrence  from any other management entities deemed necessary or prudent.  Your input would be greatly appreciated.  Pls let me know if I can provide  any further information.  I can be reached in San Ramon at 925 543 3706.   Jeff Dasovich can be reached in San Francisco at 415 782 7822.

2022-04-06 06:09:59+00:00,true,6,"  Edmund/Justin, I would appreciate your advice on a few points.    I am correct in understanding there can be different versions of the   Password Agreement and Electronic Trading Agreement?  I have seen Password  Agreement NA Version 1and an Electronic Trading Agreement Version 1 that both  have Enron North America Corp and/or its affiliates as the Enron contracting  party.  In Australia we will have to enter into  electricity derivatives  through the Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd.(EAF)  which is the only Enron  entity authorised trade in these products. Would EAF also be a party to a  Password Agreement and ETA with its potential counterparties? If  I  was starting with a clean sheet in drafting GTCs for Australian  financial power trades I would incorporate into it the  1992 ISDA Master  Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)and as well as the 1993 Commodity  Definitions. This is what Australian counterparties would expect to see.  However, I notice this approach has not been followed with any of the GTCs I  have seen. The closest is the incorporation  EFA terms  for the UK power  contracts. I suppose this raises a general question are there any established  protocols for drafting GTCs?  Small point - I notice the limitation of liability clauses in all the  documentation follows the US form.  I notice even for contracts interpreted  under English law there is an exclusion of ""special damages"".  In Australia  and I thought England special damages were defined money damages that must be  specially damages as opposed to general damages such as pain and suffering  that cannot be quantified and are assessed by the court. This is completely  different  to the meaning of this term in US. Has this issue been considered  and for whatever reason a decision has been made to go with the US wording?   How much work have we done on issues such as those relating to formation of  contracts? I note it was excluded from the scope of your surveys of the  various European jurisdictions. I am taking my brief to include those issues  relevant which are material to ensure that Enron is complying with the law  and will also have enforceable agreement. This may go wider than just  regulatory compliance issues.   If you prefer give me a call to discuss 612 9229 2310.    ","Edmund/Justin, I would appreciate your advice on a few points.

The panel was moderated by the Conference of World Regions (Jmaes Gardner and  Lucy Duncan).  Participants were:     Rep. Matthew Kisber--Tennesee  (he is also co chair of the NCSL task force  on e commerce)    Arthur Kerrigan---section chief of e commerce for the European Commission in  Brussels   David Cliche--Minister for Information Highway/Government of Quebec   DAvid Hite--CEO of Veronex Technologies   Todd Finch---President, Netscape/Canada   Bernard McKay---Vice President, INTUIT   The government folks focused most of their discussions on the need to  continue to be able to collect taxes on sales, but said they were not looking  to increase those taxes--just to be able to make it easy to collect.  Kisber  seemed  to be in the Governor Leavitt camp on e commerce solutions--he  referenced Leavitt's proposals several times.  Cliche made some interesting  statements about Quebec having all of it's government work being done via e  mail by the end of 2001---anybody who wants to do business with the  government will have to do it via e commerce.  THe private sector folks talked about the difficulty in dealing with 50  different state rules and regulations in order to do their business and the  need for uniformity and commonality.  Finch talked about the need for global  governance of the internet rather than local or parochial which will only  inhibit development of e commerce.  He also talked about if and when states  or entities will start thinking about trying to tax information that is  exchanged via e commerce and how this would be counterproductive.  McKay  brought up the concept of government becoming a competitor with the private  sector as e commerce changes the way we do business.  It was a fairly interesting discussion, but no real bombshells.

2022-04-06 16:22:59+00:00,true,6,"  Forwarded from Halliburton:  Subject: Report from WTO - Part IV     INSIDE (AND OUTSIDE) THE WTO  INSIDE   Renato Ruggiero, former Director General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) spoke at a dinner for members of the Coalition for Service Industries on Wednesday evening.  His remarks were some of the best made during the WTO Seattle Round but were off the record and will probably not appear in print.  Among his observations were:  * 1.7 billion people residing in 30 countries are trying to get into the WTO at this time.  The WTO is regarded by many as the organization needed to deal with the globalization in which all nations now find themselves. * Labor and environmental issues already have forums in which to have their issues heard.  Their problem is that nothing works as well as the WTO. That they want to move their issues into the WTO area is not only understandable, it is flattering. * (Concerning the demonstrations) ""As long as reason rules over emotions in this world, the WTO will prevail.  The demonstrator's goals may be right.  I don't know.  But, their aim is wrong.  The WTO should not be their target."" * The demonstrators have had the effect of making ministers even more determined to finish their work.  The Seattle Round has had an interesting ancillary result.  Environmental groups previously in disagreement or acting independently, have taken the occasion of the WTO meeting to unify.  Greenpeace, The Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, The National Wildlife Federation, and The World Wildlife Fund have been meeting before and during the Seattle Round.  Their goal is to put a sharp focus on what they want from the WTO.  As of this writing, it is not clear if they wish to put the WTO out of business or get their issues made part of the negotiations but the latter is more likely.  What ever they decide, the coalition of these environmentalists will be much more likely to be heard in the future.  Prior to the President's arrival, agriculture and other difficult issues were making significant headway towards resolving differences.  The President arrived in Seattle on Wednesday amongst hopes that his visit would have a positive effect on negotiations - but the opposite occurred.  His ability to communicate was put to good use as he spoke to all facets of the WTO to include the demonstrators and, until he granted an interview with the Financial Times, the best possible face was being put on WTO negotiations. The Times article was published on Thursday, however, and it upset everyone. In the interview, President Clinton stated that core standards on labor should be adopted by the WTO and included in all trade agreements.  If they were not followed, they should be enforced with sanctions.  Until these remarks, the administration had maintained that only a working group on labor should be established with the mission of analyzing links between trade and labor.  The idea of a working group was gaining steam until the interview was published.  The United States Trade Representative was rumored to be very upset and the President's remarks met with almost universal condemnation.  Delegates from Japan and the European Union made strong statements of disagreement as did most of the developing nations.  Many see the use of sanctions as the antithesis of the WTO's mission.  There was speculation that the remarks were made to assist Vice President Gore with labor in his bid for the White House and that the President did not really believe they would have any effect within the WTO.  They did - and the effect was all negative.  President Clinton made the rounds of a number of parties that evening to include one hosted for the members of congress who had worked on the African Trade bill.  At one time, prior to the President's arrival, there were 30 members of Congress on the stage with Representative Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) and it was the broadest possible array of political beliefs.  Individuals representing the most liberal side of the Democrat party stood side by side with individuals from the most conservative side of the Republican party, all waiting for the President.  When he didn't appear, the congressional representatives left the stage and mingled with about 100 guests.  It was a lobbyist's dream!  For 45 minutes, they talked, joked and lobbied while they waited for the President.  He arrived, made a predictable speech and left the stage only to find that, for security reasons, he would have to remain in the room awhile longer.  It turned out to be one of the most festive events of the week.  OUTSIDE   498 people were arrested as of Thursday morning.  Delegates from many countries were surprised that the arrests were so long in coming and expressed significant displeasure with the turmoil in the streets.  Third world countries have been the most critical.  Their concerns focus on improving their economies   They need infrastructure and financing before they can worry about the plight of sea turtles in oceans that don't even boarder their countries.  Many of them do not disagree with America's basic goals but they believe that rich countries ideals are standing in the way of third world countries progress.   As days of disturbance continue, the humor of the demonstrations is diminishing.  What is left are hard core anarchists bent simply on destruction.  The positive side of all this is that the goodness of people in Seattle is now beginning to show itself.  King Country Councilman Brian Derdowski took to the streets Tuesday evening, surveying the damage and trying to mollify the crowds.  He saw a man grab a sack of coffee at a vandalized Starbucks and he approached him.  Derdowski told the would-be looter he really shouldn't take the bag of beans and the man dropped the bag, hugged the Councilman and then walked away from the riots.   Nancy Woodland and her husband, both Seattle attorneys, saw the violence on television on Tuesday.  By Wednesday afternoon, they were in the heart of town with Windex, Comet, SOS and elbow grease.  They spent most of the day cleaning the storefronts of other peoples businesses.   Terry Webb who owns a greeting card store, has seen his business drop by 90%.  When interviewed by a local newspaper, he simply smiled and reached for one of his cards.  He handed the reporter a card that read, ""Tough times are like speed bumps.  They only slow you down for a little.""   This will be my last report from Seattle.

2022-04-06 15:54:37+00:00,true,6,"  Steve,  Here are some thoughts on why I think this is important. (sorry for the  length)  Political One of the the main problem that I see with electricity reform and its  ""benefits"" for the poor would mainly have to do with the redesign of subsidy  policy.  Subsidies should be focused to the consumer.  In general,  electricity rates in developing countries are highly subsidized.  If there is  a change in the cost structure the benefits will show in the government  finances, that is, if you do not raise the rates for the residential users  (especially for the poor).  In the Mexican proposal it is not clear what they  plan to do with the subsidies, but if they make a mistake it will become a  social problem.  I think there is an opportunity here but it requires the  advice of economic experts.  Economic Another way in which we could try to make an argument that electric reform  benefits the poor is that it does so in two indirect ways:  1.  Lower electric rates and quality of service for industrial users will  enhance a competitive industry which will be able to grow in a globalized  world or at least offer better prices for their products in the local  economy.  Lower electric costs decrease th cost of one of the supplies hence  enabling the producer to reduce or not to raise prices resulting in a lower  inflation rate.  A growing industry creates more employment...  2.  Private investment in the electric sectors will create employment but the  most important aspect is that it will take away a heavy weight off the back  of the government's finance.  The government could then re- direct resources  that it would have invested in the energy sector or use resources from the  sale of assets to develop water infrastructure, pay foreign debt, give micro  credits, build roads, improve health and education,.....  Social development (poverty) There are another aspects that are directly related to the availability of  energy services for the poor:  heating and cooking and water  Although most of the developing world has tropical or semi tropical weather  and is less subjected to cold weather (hot weather generally will not kill  you) they have some heating needs apart from the energy for cooking needs.   It is frequent that dung is used as fuel for heating and cooking purposes  with terrible effects on health which in turn results in lower productivity ,  etc.  The available alternative to dung is wood and here the problem is even  worse because these poor communities end up causing irreversible damage to  the forests and then to the soil and finally to their water resources (since  the forest sustains the soil and prevents water from causing erosion.  When  the forest dissapears water is not filtered down to natural storages  underground) As you can see its a mess.  One other extremely important aspect of the availability of energy for the  poor is that it enables them to have potable water delivered as close as  possible to their communities.  In the poorest communities little girls do  not go to school because they have to carry the water buckets home.  They do  not get an education.  The terrible thing about it is that the education  level of the mother is what can have a highest impact in the quality of life  of a poor family.  This is very sad and energy plays a huge part in the  solution.  A lot could be researched and written on this matters and about the role of  energy in the solution of these problems.  Can we  help?  Do we have the  resources that need to be commited to at least one of these aspects?  Which  one do you think will have the highest impact?  Best,  Ricardo","Steve, Here are some thoughts on why I think this is important. (sorry for the length).

In terms of work load, I would hope that once the process is up and running,  the work load will be minimal.  Clearly I would like the Working Group to  stay informed of Enron's current Regulatory Risk position, but I don't think  that this will be more than some overviews and responses to questions from my  direct team.  Given this structure, I would hope that people with political knowledge and  regulatory expertise are included.  For this effort, I need a team of people  who understand every region of the world (or at least know how to find out  about a specific country).  I hope this helps.

Since  Steve wants to finalize the groups close of business Friday,  it would be  great if each of you could put out a brief description of the working group  or Maureen could put out a composite that includes answers to these questions: What will be the primary focus of the group? What types of issues will be  dealt with?  What type (skills, experience, perspective) will you be looking  for? For example, Joe Hillings has a huge 41 company association working on  the WTO/Energy Services negotiations that draws and involves people across  Enron.  Joe- what will be the focus of this new group and what incremental  value do you see it adding. Is there one special area that isn't being  addressed? Or are you formalizing the informal group we already have working  in this area?  Is the plan to sign up for a group and then collectively  decide what to work on? Quite simply, what's the charter?  Others questions that we can discuss together on Friday include:  Who is the  customer for the work product? If an area of compensation/performance  evaluation is based on the success and participation in these groups,  who  decides if the product is valuable or the group was a success? How do we  determine the greatest value project? Where is the interface with the  commercial people? Isn't  the bottom line contribution the ultimate  determinator of success? How do we seek and involve people outside Houston  who aren't involved in a topic area, someone like Stella Chan in Korea or a  member of the India team? People who would benefit from greater exposure both  for their growth and contribution.  We have a wonderful opportunity with the consolidation of these groups to  formalize a system that transfers knowledge and experience across Enron. We  also have tremendous existing work loads, we are some what resource  constrained so that participation in these groups has to make a high value  contribution to Enron's commercial challenges.  These are great general  topics with strong  leaders.  Let's take the next step and zero in on the  details.

Anyway if  may one more question.   What  happens if you want to include a special condition in a  ""Confirmation"". Let me give an example a Goods and Services Tax will be  introduced  Australia in July 2000. We are a putting some wording in  confirmations as to what will happen if the published electricity index is  produced inclusive of GST. Clearly such a of a general  provision could  included in a revised version of the GTCs. But what happens if there is a  Master Agreement in place? Do you have to amendment to it before you can  trade?   On a more general level the more I see the more apparent it is that we should  be relying heavily on legal work already been done and merely vet it for  application to Australian laws.   Let me give an example. One area we have  identified requires work is that of establishing that EnronOnline complies  with requirements of our  Evidence Act. We are going have to establish to  potential counterparties that the system  can provide sufficient certainty as  the terms of a trade.  There must be evidence admissible in court  that  a  trade actually took place and what  version of the GTCs was were linked to a  particular product at a time.  For us to start looking at these issues from  scratch will be expensive and time consuming assuming we had a detailed  knowledge of the operation of the system.

2022-04-06 17:07:39+00:00,true,6,"  Terry:  I think I was alone among the energy services group in staying through the  bitter and surprising end of WTO. I was together with Rachel Thompson of the  OECD and services trade specialist Julian Arkell, who have been advising our  group from a European perspective. So I thought I would give you my account  of the final hours of the ""Seattle Round."" By the time you read this it will  have been covered in great detail by the world press, but as of Saturday  morning only the west coast papers seem to have gotten the full story, which  broke around 9:30 pm Seattle time, Friday night.  I went back to the convention center about 11 pm, and as I walked up the  block -- still cordoned off by riot police -- delegates were already  streaming out of the building. Emotions ranged from tired to disgusted to  dispirited. Inside, a final plenary session was underway led by WTO director  general Michael Moore and US host Charlene Barshefsky. I watched the final  moments of the plenary session on TV in the media center, where journalists  laughed as Moore made lame jokes about Seattle hospitality and vowed to  resist pressure to step down as DG. ""I intend to fulfill my contract,"" Moore  said. ""I have a background of fulfilling contracts in the labor movement.""  This was a poor choice of language since it was probably the US-influenced  attempt to launch discussions on labor standards that killed the round more  than anything else. Following the plenary, Moore and Barshefsky held a press  conference followed by another by representatives from the European Union. I  sat in as an observer to the two press conferences, which lasted until just  after 1 am Saturday.  The collapse of the launch of the ""Seattle round"" is extremely significant.  For one thing, it means that there will be no Seattle round. Although Moore  has been charged to come up with suggestions about re-starting the process  beginning early next year, it is unlikely that either the political will or  interest to do so will be sufficient before the US election campaign blows  everything else off the calendar. Re-launching the round will depend very  much on the complexion of the next US Administration, how committed it is to  trade, how much it owes to labor, whether it can stand up to the  environmental and labor groups that helped to derail the launch. Past  experience suggests that it will take several years (three to four is  average) to organize another attempt IF there is strong political motivation.   The collapse seriously undermines US credibility in international economic  issues. There was a strong feeling that the Administration had played the WTO  meeting to domestic political interests, and overplayed its hand to the  extent of jeopardizing the structure of the negotiations. One European  journalist (Guy de Jonquiere, FT) asked Barshefsky what she thought about the  common view that this was a ""terrible mess, the worst organized conference""  and that the sabotage was in part deliberate or at least that failure had  been seen as a political option by the US. Barshefsky angrily rejected the  question, and defended her failure on the grounds that ""issues that had been  intractable remained intractable."" Nonetheless, the question expressed a  general hostility towards the US as host organization, based perhaps partly  on the discomfort of delegates who were beaten up on their way into the  convention center, locked for hours on end in their hotels, and forced to  hide their WTO identification tags whenever they left streets belatedly  cordoned off for the event. Not to mention dodging protestors chaining  themselves to hotel doors, boarded up stores, and transportation difficulties  (several taxi companies went on strike on Tuesday and were thin the rest of  the week).  The failure of the Seattle round comes at a time when the other Bretton Woods  institutions -- the IMF and World Bank -- are under attack as well as the  WTO. All three have suffered from retrenchment of US funding, relentless  criticism by the US Congress, and waffling support from the Administration.  The Seattle fiasco will put more pressure on regional organizations, such as  the EU, NAFTA, FTAA, APEC, and ASEAN to continue to move towards  liberalization and give them more reasons to move into defensive modes. We  can expect to hear a lot in the next months about the possible fragmentation  of the global trading system into regional blocks, just as we did in the late  1980s when the Uruguay Round nearly collapsed. But a drift towards  regionalism may not be all bad. To the extent that regional organizations  themselves have a strong stake in keeping the global trading system open, or  at least in preserving access to major markets, they may provide the momentum  to continue work in some of the areas of interest to multinationals -- for  Enron, energy services, environment and trade, and regulatory harmonization.   Rachel Thompson, as an observer for the OECD, was in the so-called ""green  room"" where negotiations shifted on Friday afternoon after the attempt to  craft a ministerial declaration through working groups was abandoned. This  represented a return to a more traditional GATT/WTO mode of horsetrading ""in  camera"" or in a relatively small room, as opposed to the innovative but  failed US strategy of crafting a text in pieces through five working groups  (on agriculture, market access, implementation and rules, systemic and  ""other"" issues including competition policy, investment, and the  environment). The idea behind the working group structure was to open up the  negotiating process, particularly to developing countries, and make it more  democratic. Instead, it resulted in chaos. Rachel said that the green room  discussions fell apart about 8 pm Friday when it became evident that the  negotiators were ""too far apart on too many issues."" A crucial element, she  said, was the outrage felt  by developing countries over Clinton's statements  on labor rights and sanctions, in an interview en route to Seattle. Rachel  described this as a political miscalculation similar to Clinton's bungling of  the China deal during the visit to the US of Chinese vice premier Zhu Rongji  last March, when he played   At a midnight press conference, US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky  defended the Administration's strategy, argued that the interruption to the  WTO process was merely temporary, and described all the agreements reached  prior to the breakdown as ""frozen"" and ready to move ahead once the round was  launched. Barshefsky described the collapse of the talks as a ""timeout"" along  the lines of previous occasions when GATT has floundered, as in 1982 (failure  of the US to launch a services negotiation) and 1990 (failure to bring  Uruguay Round to a conclusion as planned; the Uruguay Round ended finally in  1993). Barshefsky was immediately challenged by EU commissioner Pascal Lamy,  who said that the proposals submitted in Seattle were ""dead"" although some of  the ideas would live on.   ""What I think happened -- this was the fourth in a series of this kind of  episode -- was that the delegations came, they proceeded to work  exceptionally hard and in good faith but were not quite willing to make  political decisions,"" Barshefsky said. Lamy agreed that the issues were  complex but added that the ""posturing"" of some of the actors helped block the  launch. He blamed the collapse partly on faulty procedure. ""Two days ago  prospects seemed brighter [before the working groups were formed]. This is  something that we do have to reflect upon."" But he went on to say that the  WTO itself was to blame for the problems. ""The process has to be reassessed,  reinvigorated, refurbished and maybe rebuilt,"" Lamy said. ""Efficiency and  transparency are common problems in modern institutions. The WTO does not  have the institutional strength, the culture, or procedures to do this right.""  What happens next, and what are the implications for Enron's effort in energy  services?  First, nothing new will happen on energy services until a new round is  launched; This, however, gives us time to work on definitional issues. If the round had  started as planned in March 2000, we might still be unprepared with arguments  to support the ""broad"" definition of energy services we have promoted Third, we will have time to build a dialogue with the EU and Japan in  particular on energy services, and to cultivate programs similar to the APEC  work program on energy services in other regional organizations Finally, although we have viewed the proposed APEC work program on energy  services as weak and a distraction from WTO work, this may turn out to be the  strongest available vehicle to work on basic issues of definition and best  practices  In terms of WTO itself, two streams of activity are possible, maybe three.  First, existing working groups will continue (separate from the drafting  committees that were set up this week). The most important of these is one on  domestic regulatory issues that is not time-specific, according to Julian  Arkell. Julian describes domestic regulation and regulatory harmonization as  the biggest future area of difficulty for WTO, and it is also one that is  directly relevant to Enron's interest in regulatory standardization in  electricity and natural gas regimes globally. The domestic regulatory working  group has started programs on transparency, ""necessity,"" equivalency  (including harmonization), and international standards. Arcane as these  discussions may be, they have enormous ongoing importance for the rules based  global trading system. A second possible stream is to push ahead with the so-called ""built-in""  agenda on agriculture and services. Barshefsky seemed to be arguing that the  built-in agenda could go ahead regardless of the failure to launch a  comprehensive round. Rachel and Julian both felt this was dubious. In any  event, it does not help energy services because this was not among the  ""built-in"" service sectors. A third possible stream would be separate negotiations to complete the  previous services round in 1994, along the lines of the 1997 information  technology agreement and proposed ITA Two. Theoretically, energy services  could be discussed or negotiated in terms of a reference paper indicating the  unique features of the sector and advancing the agenda on domestic  regulation. This also seems unlikely, given that the question of a broader  services round now overhangs any discussion in services.  On electronic commerce, we might expect to see some different viewpoints  along the lines of the basic split between Barshefsky and Lamy. However, Lamy  said in response to a question that ""nothing has been agreed"" on e-commerce.  ""Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. The followup is probably up to  the normal WTO process. Once that is settled, [the moratorium on e-commerce  taxation] wouldn't be a problem and we can take the issue rapidly.""  I may find out more during the day depending on who is still left in Seattle.  The Coalition of Service Industries closed its room early this morning after  doing a terrific job in terms of informing its members and corralling  Administration officials to give briefings. We should take heart from CSI's  experience. It was formed in 1982 to get services on the agenda of the  Uruguay Round. It took four years to launch the round (in 1986) then another  eight years to get the first broad services agreement (in 1994). This was a  setback, but the meetings provided an opportunity to meet some new service  industry players, such as the brand new Japan Services Network (established  Oct. 15, 1999), a new services industry group in Hong Kong, and the European  Services Forum. Back to the drawing board, but the drawing board itself is  much bigger.  Cheers, Edith Terry Enron/from Seattle ","Terry: I think I was alone among the energy services group in staying through the bitter and surprising end of the WTO.
