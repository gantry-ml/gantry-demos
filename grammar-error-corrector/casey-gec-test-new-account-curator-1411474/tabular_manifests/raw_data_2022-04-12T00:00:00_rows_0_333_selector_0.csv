Therefore, either WestLB  needs to enter into the agreement with Peoples or Enron can enter into an  option agreement.

2022-04-12 16:07:34+00:00,true,1,"  I believe that we are in a position to cross one more agreement off our  list.  I had a conference call on Friday afternoon with Boyd Springer, Roy  Rodriguez (Peoples Commercial), Tim Hermann (Peoples Commercial), Mary  Klyasheff (Peoples Regulatory Counsel) and Gerry Fox (Peoples Regulatory  Counsel) to discuss Boyd's comments regarding the regulatory issues of the  Affiliate Master.  His comments and our recommendations are as follows:  1)  Boyd had initially questioned the need to file for approval due to an  exemption that exists for transactions conducted with Affiliates in the  ordinary course of business at standard or prevailing market prices.    There are two types of Affiliate transactions contemplated; a) simple  buy/sells at a clear market price (which will fall under the exemption and  don't need to wait for ICC approval ) and b) complex transactions with  sharing arrangements,  management fees or other similar structures (which  will not fall under the exemption and must wait for ICC approval).  Since ICC  approval must be sought for certain transactions, it is recommended that we  proceed with filing the Affiliate Master ASAP.  2)  Boyd had noted that as written the Affiliate Master becomes effective  upon initial approval of the ICC.  However, there is an appeal/rehearing  process for intervenors after initial approval and prior to final approval.   Therefore, there exists a remote possibility that we could begin transacting  under the Affiliate Master and not receive final approval.  After discussing this issue with Mary and Gerry, the probability is minimal  that such an event would occur as we will receive feedback from the ICC from  both the informal conversations prior to filing and throughout the process  prior to approval.  As such, it is recommended that the effective date as  written is acceptable.  3)  Boyd had indicated that the inclusion of the confidentiality provision  may add further complexity to the filing and may want to be avoided to ease  approval.    After discussing the issue further, it appears that the confidentiality  provision does add some complexity in the filing process in that additional  steps must be taken.  However, after the filing is made, the inclusion does  not add to the approval time in any measurable way.  Further, Peoples always  files its contracts under confidentiality and feels that this should be no  different.  Given that it will protect transactional information and does not  add any time to the approval process, it is  recommended that we include the  confidentiality provision as written.    In summary, unless there are any other concerns, we should proceed with  filing the Affiliate Master as currently written.  Jeff Hodge has already  reviewed, approved and initialed the Affiliate Master as to its transactional  content.     Prior to filing, Kathy Donofrio (V.P., Regulatory Affairs) will forward of  copy of the Affiliate Master to the ICC Staff followed shortly by a meeting  to discuss the impending filing and get any initial feedback that may affect  the filing.    Current expectations are that approval will take a minimum of four months.   For comparisons, Nicor currently has an Affiliate filing at the ICC that  began in May and is already postponed until October.  Further, the current  high priced gas environment has caught the attention of the ICC.  Although it  may mean the ICC will be very busy, it may also be an opportunity to get an  expedited approval if we can show the ICC that PGL/NS ratepayers will benefit  from the Affiliate Master.  Boyd - Please let us know if I have mistated any of the issues or if you  disagree with any of the recommendations as I would like to give Peoples the  green light today to proceed with the filing process.  Thanks,  GREGG  ","I believe that we are in a position to cross one more agreement off our list.

As I realize that this  transfer must be managed carefully in order to avoid placing these turbines  and the remaining assets in the West LB structure on our balance sheet, I was  wondering if you could offer some guidance regarding this issue.   Specifically, if we could set up a meeting for Thursday or Friday of this  week to discuss how this might be accomplished, I'd appreciate it.    Thanks.

2022-04-12 08:17:12+00:00,true,1,"  Ben:  Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Pontiac TSS.   Under the guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission  Tarriff, we are required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of  receipt (7/7/00) in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the  ComEd queue.  If we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the  ComEd queue becomes the date of execution of the LOI.  Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron  with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days  (ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD  will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an  estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and  PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie  ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study  currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the  next 2-3 weeks).    ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current  interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a  proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed  projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all  interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain  current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project  with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the  necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line  prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that  this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This  interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site  relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect).  I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe  that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the  interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment  responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed  interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this  week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior  to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have  recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am  simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in  a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.   From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we  executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines  Green Land Development, L.L.C.

Although he wanted to schedule the evidentiary hearing for the last week in September, the Commisssion's calendar is currently full.  So he has tentatively scheduled it for Monday, October 2.  The problem with that is that it makes it virtually impossible to meet the November 1 construction date if the Commission allows the customary 30 days after the hearing in which to file briefs and proposed orders.  I urged Sami to please see if he could calendar the hearing for the third week in September.    One of the things that ENA will have to do is to have notice published in newspapers in the Rocky Mount area for several consecutive weeks prior to the hearing so that affected persons will have an opportunity to comment.  I am trying to get Sami to place the draft agenda item and procedural schedule on the Commission's July 31 Open Agenda Conference so that the notices can start to run August 7.  That action, along with scheduling the hearing for the third week in September, will make it far more likely than not that the CPCN will issue before November 1.    Failing that, we can work with the Public Staff to shorten the period within which to file briefs and proposed orders after the hearing to three or preferably two weeks.  It will not be difficult to do that if there are no intervenors, or if the intervenors do not object.  Sami has promised to let me know by tomorrow when the agenda item will go before the Commission, and the dates in the procedural schedule.  Please call me if you have questions.

2022-04-12 08:17:12+00:00,true,1,"  Ben:  Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Plano TSS.  In  addition, ComEd has included a cover letter which indicates a significant  level of uncertainty regarding a '01 interconnect at Plano.  Under the  guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission Tarriff, we are  required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of receipt (7/7/00)  in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the ComEd queue.  If  we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the ComEd queue becomes  the date of execution of the LOI.  Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron  with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days  (ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD  will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an  estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and  PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie  ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study  currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the  next 2-3 weeks).    ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current  interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a  proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed  projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all  interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain  current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project  with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the  necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line  prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that  this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This  interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site  relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect).  I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe  that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the  interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment  responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed  interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this  week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior  to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have  recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am  simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in  a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.   From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we  executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines  Green Land Development, L.L.C.

We are now  awaiting PERC's response.  I am assuming that they will agree to the terms  since their alternative is to lose $ on the units at resale with no  opportunity for recapture.    I wanted to give you a ""heads-up"" since the timing will be is tight once I  get the green light to proceed with legal docs.  Please let me know what  documents we will need and how you suggest we expedite the process (LOI or  otherwise).  Calumet Project Participation (with ABB's): ENA has verbally told them we will not participate in Calumet and the LLC  term to get to execution has expired. Upon release by Laura/Ben - need to send them formal notice under the PDA  that we are withdrawing our notice of interest to participate in Calumet.  Going Forward: We need to put the general terms in the proposal into a formal document.   Letter of Intent authorizing us to take control of the development/site sales  process at our expense - if they the deal unwinds we get reimbursed for our  direct costs spent to further perfect/sell their sites. Assess PERC's legal position with ABB (was it fraud or gross negligence that  ABB failed to mention this problem they've known about for 10 years?). Authorization/indemnification from PERC to negotiate with ABB to grant  contract concessions that will benefit Enron Canada as subsequent owner. Enron Canada will likely be involved as lead negotiater with ABB - who in  legal will work with ENA/Enron Canada on this ?  Timing:   Enron Canada - To meet their 2001 schedule we need to have legal  authorization to engage ABB by early-July. ""Pitch Book"" - In its current form includes Calumet/Torrence we need  authorization from PERC - Bruce is expecting to begin circulation by week of  July 10th. EPC contractors -  They bid Calumet using ABB, and we want them to re-bid for  LM 6000's.  Need authorization from PERC (July 14th or sooner) with cost  coverage provisions, since the EPC contractors are likely to want to charge  us $50-$100k to re-bid the deal.           ","No problem.

2022-04-12 05:05:36+00:00,true,1,"  Lisa,  Thank you for the timely comments.  Credit support.  On the issue of credit support for a project company  partially owned by Enron, ABB has some concerns even when Enron still holds  an equity interest due to some late payment problems they had in the past  with an Enron project company.  Also, the ABB and GE payment schedules are  different, with GE being more front end loaded. For example, GE will have  received 45% of the total payments due by the time the first 4 units are  ready to ship; by the time the last 6 units are ready to ship, they will have  received 95% of the payment.  In contrast, we hold 25% of the price of each  ABB unit until delivery (15%) and acceptance (10%) of that particular unit.  Effective date.  The typical reason for an earlier effective date is to  capture any work which ABB may have chosen to do during the option period in  order to hold their guaranteed completion dates.  In the GE contract we  addressed the issue in section 30.3, stating that it governs all work  performed pursuant to the agreement in principle. It is fine with me to make  the effective date a current one.   Price change. I will confirm why the prices changed $78,000 from the latest  option agreement. I suspect there were changes in the specifications since  the data sheets have changed.    Hope this was helpful.  Kay          Enron North America Corp.

This is not a GE requirement  and it is a doubling up of Enron-type support which will make the venture  much more expensive to finance.  Purchase Agreement: Def. of Business Day:  let's add New York since this is where WestLB funds  from. 2.1(B):  It should be ""Agent's"" person to approve change orders, not  ""Purchaser's"" 2.2:  ""Purchaser"" should be used rather than ""WestLB"" since it is not as  limiting. 7.1:  Why is the Effective Date backdated to the date of the first option  agreement execution date? Exhibit N - Purchase Amount Reconciliation:  The total amount of the three  purchase amounts is $78M less than the same amounts detailed in the latest  Option Agreement.  I'd like to understand why this is, especially in light of  the Effective Date in 7.1, to insure that AA won't determine that the Option  Premiums paid were somehow a deposit or credit toward the purchase price of  the transformers.

Assess PERC's legal position with ABB (was it fraud or gross negligence that  ABB failed to mention this problem they've known about for 10 years?). Authorization/indemnification from PERC to negotiate with ABB to grant  contract concessions that will benefit Enron Canada as subsequent owner. Enron Canada will likely be involved as lead negotiater with ABB - who in  legal will work with ENA/Enron Canada on this ?  Timing:   Enron Canada - To meet their 2001 schedule we need to have legal  authorization to engage ABB by early-July. ""Pitch Book"" - In its current form includes Calumet/Torrence we need  authorization from PERC - Bruce is expecting to begin circulation by week of  July 10th. EPC contractors -  They bid Calumet using ABB, and we want them to re-bid for  LM 6000's.  Need authorization from PERC (July 14th or sooner) with cost  coverage provisions, since the EPC contractors are likely to want to charge  us $50-$100k to re-bid the deal.

In the case of an assignment to a party described in (ii), (vi), or (vii)= =20 (other than  Enron Engineering & Construction or NEPCO), Seller shall be=20 entitled to request and receive an appropriate guaranty, letter of credit,= =20 payment bond or other reasonable form of payment security, in amount not to= =20 exceed the amount of the Purchase Amount remaining to be paid at the time o= f=20 the assignment, unless the assignor agrees to remain liable for all future= =20 liabilities under this Agreement.

Except for (i) through (vii) above, this Agreement or any rights or=20 obligations hereunder may not be assigned by Purchaser or Agent to other=20 parties without the prior written consent of Seller which shall not be=20 unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Seller agrees to respond to= =20 any request for consent within thirty (30) Days following its receipt of su= ch=20 request.  Any failure to respond within the foregoing time period shall be= =20 deemed to be a grant by Seller of its consent to the proposed assignment.  = In=20 determining whether Purchaser or Agent shall be permitted to assign this=20 Agreement, Seller shall only be deemed to be reasonable in withholding its= =20 consent if the proposed assignee does not have substantially the same or=20 better credit quality than Agent unless (a) the proposed assignee provides= =20 appropriate guaranties, letters of credit or other assurances of payment=20 issued by an entity or person with substantially the same or better credit= =20 quality than Agent, or (b) the assignor agrees to remain liable for all=20 future liability under this Agreement.

Any other=20 assignment by Purchaser or Agent other than as permitted hereunder shall be= =20 void and without force or effect.=20  Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, in connection with any=20 assignment permitted under this Section 22.2 to any assignee, the Purchaser= =20 shall have the right, from time to time by Notice to Seller and without=20 Seller=01,s consent, to (i) designate such assignee to be the successor of= =20 Purchaser hereunder, (ii) designate such assignee to be the successor of = =20 =01&Agent=018 hereunder, (iii) designate such assignee as a sub-agent of th= e Agent=20 hereunder, and (iv) designate that such assignee has succeeded to all of th= e=20 rights and obligations of both Purchaser and Agent, whereupon=20 (notwithstanding the first WHEREAS clause hereof, but subject to any=20 subsequent appointment of an =01&Agent=018 hereunder) each reference to =01= &Purchaser=018=20 hereunder shall be deemed a reference to such assignee acting in its=20 individual capacity and each reference to an =01&Agent=018 herein shall be = deemed=20 deleted.  Upon any permitted assignment of the rights under this Agreement to acquire=  a=20 Unit or Units, and the assumption (in accordance with the terms hereof) of= =20 the obligations related thereto, Seller shall enter into a separate purchas= e=20 agreement with the permitted assignee (each, a =01&Facility Agreement=018).=   The=20 terms of each Facility Agreement will be in strict conformity with the term= s=20 and conditions of this Agreement, except for site specific changes as agree= d=20 by the Seller and such assignee.

As I had suggested, they understand what the reference to the 188 MW encompasses. Also, there would be no problem with substituting different generator sets for the LM 6000s if there is an economy/efficiency basis for it and reliability is not impaired.  He went on to say that he saw no problem with the CPCN Application from an engineering perspective.  As far as the engineers are concerned, North Carolina Power needs the power and they are pleased that the generation is going to be built in North Carolina.  He expects the bulk of the questions regarding the project to come from the Accounting Division, and most of those will be directed to North Carolina Power and to be focused on the RFP process.  The Public Staff has three divisions that investigate and analyze applications--Engineering, Accounting and Economic Research.  Typically, each section sends out separate data requests.  I will be calling around over the next two or three days to see what questions might be surfacing from the other divisions.  > Confidentiality Note: > This email message is intended solely for the individual or individuals > named above.

2022-04-12 05:19:27+00:00,true,1,"  At Sheila's suggestion, we have decided to bite off the overall PERC  tranaction in little pieces, attacking the most critical one's individually  as we go.    In order for us to focus on the value/commercial issues surrounding the sites  in Com-Ed, we need to get the ball in motion on the site sale release from  PERC first.    This should be a brief - but binding - letter agreement which includes the  following points:  PERC is hereby authorizing ENA to solicit interests in the Calumet and  Torrence sites for the purpose of sale, joint venture, development, or other  transactions. ENA will have the sole and exclusive authority to determine whether or not to  commit the site(s) to such a commercial transaction, and PERC shall have the  right - but not the obligation - to participate in said transaction on an  equal ownership basis with ENA.  In the event that PERC does not elect to participate in said transaction, ENA  shall have the right to undertake such a transaction to the exclusion of  PERC, provided that ENA pays PERC the following exercise prices for the  site(s) in question:  Calumet price = $1,000,000.  Torrence price =  $100,000.   Said exercise price shall be the sole and total compensation for PERC should  they elect not to participate in said transaction as proposed by ENA. PERC shall have __ days to give formal written notice of its intent to  participate in such transaction from the date of notice by ENA. If PERC elects to participate with ENA on said transaction(s), ENA and PERC  will share equally in any proceeds thereof, however, no exercise price shall  be payable if PERC elects to participate with ENA. The term of this authorization shall be for 90 days from the date of  execution and 10 days evergreen thereafter unless cancelled by either party  by two days written notice. This agreement is binding on the parties hereto, provided however, that it  shall be conditioned upon PERC and Enron (or an affiliate or agent thereof)  executing a mutually agreeable document to effect the transfer of ownership  of their turbines for a purchase price of $56,000,000.   The next item we will need is a authorization document allowing us (Enron  Canada/ENA) to negotiate with ABB for changes needed in the ABB contract.","At Sheila's suggestion, we have decided to bite off the overall PERC transaction in little pieces, attacking the most critical ones individually as we go.

These initiatives relate to using internet technologies to  improve customer satisfaction, improve productivity, shorten the sales cycle,  etc, not directly to transacting per se.  For example, we are creating a  customer portal that will allow our existing customers to get access to a  variety of information--such as billing, energy usage, project status,  general news, etc.--all through a single browser view that can be customized  to present only the information that the customer's interested in.  Another  application we're exploring would use internet technology to streamline the  deal process through on-line collaboration with our prospective customers.   Although these wouldn't be considered traditional e-commerce initiatives,  they're examples of using the internet to create more value through better  execution in our business.

The Economist's US e-business series was founded in March 2000 with Summits in New York and Laguna Niguel California, and with the subtext ""Strategic business transformation for chief executives in the digital economy"".  I am aware that you attended the event in Laguna Niguel, where John Chambers, Dan Nordstrom, and Kevin O'Connor were among the speaker faculty.  The fall E-Business Summits are scheduled for October 2nd-3rd at the JW Marriott in Atlanta, and October 18th-19th at the Ritz-Carlton in Chicago. I have attached preliminary drafts of the programme for both cities, which reflect a session dedicated to Enron Net Works.  We are particularly interested in including a presentation on how Enron has leveraged core competencies to take on a new role in the Internet economy, including the Net Works initiative to create B2B websites for other businesses and industries. We would be delighted to have you speak on this subject at either the Atlanta or Chicago Summit.  I understand that you have already agreed to participate as a speaker in the 21st Century Internet Summit that will take place September 20-22 in Laguna Niguel CA.

It'll give you an excuse to sleep late in your own bed!  I envision a panel of the heads of e-business and technology at several major companies, including Don Paul from Chevron, John Leggate from BP Amoco, Bob Peebler from Haliburton and one or two others, to discuss a range of key issues.  Little if any advance preparation would be needed on your part.  We're trying to get either or both Keith Krach from Ariba and Mark Hoffman from Commerce One to provide the opener.  If both accept, we will probably have one deliver in the morning and the other at lunch.  Or maybe we'll have a mud wrestling contest.  Finally, we're much closer to Interactive Texas and wanted to see if there is anything you'd like mentioned about Enron technology initiatives during Jeff's introduction.  My wife Suzanne will be doing the intro.  She will have a wealth of broader market statistics, but you may have some milestones you'd like mentioned about EOL's progress or something else suited to this Texas business and government audience.

I have received feedback from others in the group as well and they  agree with our general thinking.  Have you talked with Louise lately?  We are  announcing today that we will be pushing our pricing to other platforms in  the US (therefore we keep all the liquidity of their markets).  Maybe this  will apply to these guys, someday.  Certainly it is not appropriate now and  with your domination concerns it might scare them even more.  My time is very limited next week and I am double booked most of the time.    I'm out Wed - Sunday and then the analyst meetings begin after that.  I  really don't have time to meet with them especially if there is not real deal  pending.

I am confident we can get it done even  though it will be a fire drill.  We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there, it was  just being held or managed in four places.  It will all  be pulled together  by Monday in one place (one complete document) and will have about 15 major  categories with specific tasks under each category with status, person  responsible, comments and date to be completed.  It will also have a complete  timeline. We can review that Monday and agree on its content.  Louise agreed  to review it as well.  As it relates to the people you mentioned, let me know how and/or who you  want to pull in after we agree on the control document.  That way we will  know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them.  Salley Beck called (she mentioned you had called her as well) and we agreed  that the ClickPaper's back office representative would officially be Scott  Earnest (he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with  him for months).  She is going to get in place people to be our Product  Control Group for CP launch on July 24th.  Scott and Salley will work to  source it so that we have 3 or 4 people trained and ready on the 24th to  receive password applications, create customer profiles on ClickPaper and  start the applications through credit, legal and tax and finally get out user  IDs to clients.  We will leverage off the EOL process but not use their  people unless there is some emergency.  Remember, we are only setting up  people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified.  We also have a help desk person starting next week.  I don't have his name  yet, but we have him and one more on the way.  We will create for them a  brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can.  I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave.  We walked inch by inch  through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done.  We have a  few holes, but it is not that far away.  She is going to think about a  process document for this and get back to me Monday.  I have a detailed EOL  one and we will give it our shot this weekend.  Let me know what Mark Palmer says.  He knows we have been using Margaret.  We  will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan  and what she needs to do.  We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive  mailing ( a letter) that does not include temporary IDs/passwords.  We will  tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers, we want to use  this time to get them pre-registered.  Besides, there is no way to test a  1000 temporary IDs anyway.  We will send those out later.  as I said earlier,  the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area (or garden as  Lousie would call it) by next for Friday or the following Monday. That way  people can surf the content and get registered.  On legal, I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we  had a detailed discussion today about the contracts, what is needed and the  deadline. There is legal work left to do ( the current draft of the password  application doesn't work), but if Taylor can help, that would be great.  We  will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday.  I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy (with Bob Crane and  Hal as well) to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control  issues associated with it.  Credit is fine, we have been working with  Bradford for months, but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual  posting. I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and  views.  The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all  their comments by the end of next week. They will also be given the complete  Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to  help the roll out.  We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday, July  22nd for the final testing of the system.  Remember, the 24th is a one (Enron)-to-many launch with a financial market  only.  ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section, Enron is so  it is simply a new distribution channel for Enron's existing financial  offering.  Later, we will build it out for physical (probably sooner rather  than later).  Finally, I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop  but Louise said today that is October or November.  It will only be  many-to-many if someone comes in and makes a compelling case ($$$) to do so.  Thanks.  See you tomorrow.  GP     To: Greg Piper/Corp/Enron@Enron cc:   Subject: ClickPaper.com   Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.  I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines,  personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another  good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and  assignments. Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very  smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and  he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a  couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse  engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has  others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his  existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper  already). Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the  short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she  could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good  option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary  Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck  (advice and discuss additional resources). I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick  thoughts on process and lessons learned. I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early  versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper. I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the  marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure  that he understood the importance and priority of this effort. I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John  Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday  afternoon. Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to  add a trading perspective?  A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.  mike          ","Thanks. m Enron North America Corp.

Here is what I want to see done in short  order.  Meeting with all key technologist on the full suite of products and  functionality with complete demonstration by i2.  I would especially want PB,  JP, BP, HE, and JG from George's group. Follow-up meeting (after the technologists see functionality and form  opinions and possible applications) with key commercial leaders:  GP -  P&P;  TG - CommodityLogic; BG - Metals and steel;  JF - New Markets and  Investments; AS - New Markets and Bus Dev.  During that meeting, we need to  have some real players with i2 there to brainstorm and discuss business  expansion opportunities in the specific verticals.  It would be good to  actually have this meeting in Dallas but I am concerned about attendance.  i2  owns the process and supply/downstream management in these industries and we  need to really look to see if our combination can accelerate our new efforts  and solve any logistic issues. Put together an action plan.  George's group has already put a presentation  together about i2, the products and possible applications.  George, please  sent that to John.  I would like that document to be our updated business  plan for i2 to be used as a ""living"" document as we move forward. Assign someone to make and co-ordinate the use and full deployment of those  products (utilize our $10 million spend).  I want someone to have the  responsibility for i2 and he or she can also work with EBS on what they are  doing also.  To be clear, we have spent the $10 million already but are not  using the products.  I want to deploy all (if possible) and make this  investment fully utilized.  I do understand that we don't drive businesses  around a pre-purchased product but we should look at is as a sunk cost and  rationalize why we shouldn't use if rather that simply considering it as an  option. Jason Robert, (469) 357-6737, was at the dinner with Sanjiv, Greg Brady, Jeff  and Greg and he knows some of the mutual objectives.  He would be the guy to  work with and set it all up. EBS should be involved as well.  Rex Shelby is spending a lot of time with  i2, weekly visits, and should also participate and use their products as well. Is there an application for all of EES and their business? Remember, Ken Lay is considering joining their board and we should be able to  give him very clear insight on their products and how their company works. PB, if you want someone outside Pavetto's group  to work on this that is fine  but i want to understand the background and how they will make this happen.    Thanks and please let me know your initial thoughts and timing.  If you need  to have me send out an email to make sure that everyone understands the  priority, please draft up and I'll send out.

2022-04-12 09:00:26+00:00,false,3,"  The first phase of the energy.enron.com pilot program was launched earlier  this week.  Through this site we will initially offer a one- and two-year  fixed-price gas product to small and medium-sized businesses behind four  utilities in Ohio and Illinois.  We are contacting these customers using a  direct mail piece (attached below) that was released Monday.  Customers  accessing the site can receive real-time quotes for our retail gas products  and a contract.  The objectives of the pilot are two-fold.  First, to learn what small and  medium-sized businesses like and dislike about purchasing energy products  through the web.  Second, to understand the technical and business process  challenges we will face in offering these products on a larger scale through  the web.  We wanted to achieve both these objectives in a low profile  manner.  Thus we used a limited customer pilot.  Our basic philosophy is to  quickly try, learn and improve, and then scale up.  The team of EES and IBM employees who worked on this initiative did a  fantastic job despite some setbacks.  We delayed the launch of the site about  8 weeks for two principal reasons.  First, we concluded that we needed to add  a price comparison feature to the site.  This proved more difficult than  expected and still requires improvement.  Second, we experienced technical  problems with the stability of the underlying database application that  required a fair amount of time to resolve.  Going forward, we have two paths occurring in parallel.  First, the design  and technical performance of the existing site will be continuously improved  over the next weeks and months.  We will add the capability to sell power  products in a limited number of states in the next 8 weeks or so.  A process  is in place to learn and document as much as possible throughout this  on-going pilot period.    In parallel, we have engaged McKinsey & Co. to help with a 4-6 week  mid-market strategy development effort that will help define the specific  products, target customers, and sales channels necessary to pursue the  mid-market in an aggressive way.  Out of this effort will also come some  high-level requirements for a technology and business process platform that  is scaleable and flexible enough to support a large number of transactions  and a broad array of products.  We envision offering a wider array of power  and gas products in more markets nationally, as well as other non-energy  products, such as facility services, capital, and insurance.  This second  generation platform will take advantage of the learning that occurs  throughout the pilot period and will integrate with our mid-office billing  and customer service systems.  We will also try to leverage as much as  possible from the success of EnronOnline.  A complete post-development assessment is underway and will be completed  within about two weeks.  Based on our learning during the first phase of the  pilot,  we will implement specific processes to reduce development cycle time  and improve customer response to our offerings.  Finally, I'd like to recognize the hard work of the team members that  contributed to the development version 1.0 of the site.  Thank you all.

I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines,  personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another  good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and  assignments. Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very  smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and  he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a  couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse  engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has  others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his  existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper  already). Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the  short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she  could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good  option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary  Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck  (advice and discuss additional resources). I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick  thoughts on process and lessons learned. I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early  versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper. I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the  marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure  that he understood the importance and priority of this effort. I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John  Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday  afternoon.

We will support your effort to make it a success. However, I  have a few concerns:  Whatever the local differences, the commercial effort will be very similar to  that in Brazil. Therefore, I recommend you involve the relevant commercial  people there, so we can replicate experiences and lessons learned. I agree  and  I have proposed whoever the applicable Sao Paulo resources are that will  have responsibility for EOL should be part of the process either via our  weekly conference calls or physically present in Argentina during strategic  periods of implementation. The relevant Sao Paulo functions should decide how  important this is to them and allocate time and resources accordingly. Can you please specify your resource requirements for IT support for both  implementation and operation. I do not believe we are adequately staffed and  we can not afford to have any S?o Paulo IT resources sucked into this without  proper planning. We have always tried not to suck on Sao Paulo unless  absolutely necessary. We will continue to operate in this manner. We have  kept the appropriate people aware of our status and situation on a weekly  basis and I believe we have all the necessary resources up and running now. I  will have a better feel after my meetings this week. The bandwidth installed from BA to Houston is not sufficient to support the  operation of front and back office. Lead time for upgrades is 90 days. We  have been aware of this need for a period of time. We will need a solution to  the time schedule you are proposing. Please assist in this effort and let me  know what our options are.  In the future, I will appreciate to be informed and consulted on any  activities in our region involving Enron Net Works. You have been involved in our meetings over the past few months although  Patrick has indicated we missed you in the scheduling  of the latest  implementation meeting . We will cc everyone to avoid not fully communicating  in the future. I will also forward the full implementation schedule and  assignments to the above cc list.  If you have any additional concerns please contact me directly.

We would like to  have you present on October 10, from 9:00-10:00 AM.   The conference committee has chosen the One Enron theme since the attendees  at the conference are coming from all the Enron business units both  domestically and internationally. The estimated attendance at the conference  will be 225 Enron and Joint Venture employees.  The invitations are being  issued enterprise-wide to employees who are engaged in  operations/maintenance/purchasing.  This conference is the expansion of the  annual plant managers' conference that is held each year in Houston.  We are  replacing it with what we will be a ""Best in Class"" conference addressing  multiple topics that will provide direction that will result in lower costs,  increased earnings and employee retention.  We will also be utilizing this  conference as an additional mentoring activity for our Minority/Women  Business Enterprise suppliers. I hope that you will accept our invitation, because I know many of the  participates are very interested in learning more about what Enron's  ecommerce strategy.  An agenda has been attached for your review, however it is still in  development.    If you have any questions, I can be reached at (713) 646-8235.   Jennifer L.

Please mark your calendar for our next Vision and Values meeting - Wednesday,  August 16 from 9am until noon in eb 46c1.  Below summarizes the key points from our July 19 meeting:  Communications Training Feedback from I&I continues to be positive. The number of vp's and above not enrolled in Executive Impact and Influence  increased to 111.  The increase is the result of cancellations.   We had a discussion about what the ""quantifiable penalty"" would be for vp's  and above who DID NOT participate in the Executive Impact and Influence  training.  I continue to research this issue.  I hope to have an update at  our next meeting on August 16. Work continues on the development on Executive Impact and Influence II.  The  design of this one-day training session is slated to be completed by the end  of August.  The plan is to conduct the first training session by the end of  September.  P&D training will be included in the course curriculum.  Development of the on-line communications course continues working with  Cognitive Arts with a target completion of year end.  V&V Task Force members  will receive a call from Cognitive Arts to provide input into the design of  the course.   Communication Tools The updated PeopleFinder and ExpertFinder are on schedule.  PeopleFinder  should be available at the end of July and ExpertFinder should be available  by mid-September.  P&D  Work continues to roll P&D out in the new Enron tool, ThinkBank.  Initial map  sites for drop down content on the P&D flowchart are being developed. Facilitators are currently being identified throughout the organization. We need all V&V Task Force members to communicate with their business units  about using this tool when appropriate.  Communication Campaign Additional products continue to be distributed throughout the Houston Enron  building with interesting Enron facts.   Targeted international offices received their Vision and Values posters.  Diversity Dick Liebert reported that questions for the ETC survey are currently being  developed. Three additional Diversity Focus Groups are being held to include the  perspective of commercial employees. A meeting of the entire Diversity Task Force is scheduled for Sept. 26.  Best Companies Survey Mary Clark and team completed Enron's application and forwarded it to Fortune  on July 25.  Keep your fingers crossed!  That covers the high points of the meeting.

Orleans De La Salle (FSU, LSU, Mich, A&M, = UT)   Basketball Team in Early NIT  The Texas basketball team will host Navy on Nov. 13 in the first round of t= he Preseason National Invitation Tournament. The starting time will be announc= ed later. The winner of the Texas-Navy game will advance to play the winner of the Mississippi State-California first-round contest in the second round on Nov= . 15. The site for the second-round game has not been determined, but it will start at 7 p.m. and will be televised nationally by ESPN2. The field also includes four other teams who advanced to play in last season's NCAA Tournament (Duke, Temple, Indiana and Pepperdine) and six squads which played in last season's postseason NIT (New Mexico, California= , Princeton, Villanova, Marquette and Delaware). The other teams selected for the 16th Preseason NIT are Fairfield, Mississippi State, George Mason, Navy and South Alabama. The semifinals and finals will again be played at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The semifinal round is Nov. 22, with both games televised nationally by ESPN. The third-place game and championship game are Nov. 24. The championship game will also be televised nationally by ESPN. No game times for the semifinals or finals have been announced. This is Texas' third appearance in the Preseason NIT. The Longhorns lost at Iowa State in the first round of the 1988 NIT and finished in fourth place with a 2-2 record during the 1991 Preseason NIT. The Longhorns concluded the 1999-2000 season with an overall mark of 24-9 a= nd advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. They had a final AP ranking of No. 15, which was the highest post-season ranking ever at UT. Here is the complete schedule:  First Round Game 1  Monday, Nov. 13     Delaware at Temple Game 2  Monday, Nov. 13     George Mason at New Mexico Game 3  Tuesday, Nov. 14     Pepperdine at Indiana (6 p.m., ESPN) Game 4  Tuesday, Nov. 14      South Alabama at Marquette Game 5  Monday, Nov. 13     Mississippi State at California (11 p.m., ESPN2= ) Game 6  Monday, Nov. 13     Navy at Texas Game 7  Tuesday, Nov. 14     Fairfield at Villanova Game 8  Tuesday, Nov. 14     Princeton at Duke (8 p.m., ESPN)  Second Round (at campus sites) Game 9  Wednesday, Nov. 15  Game 1 winner vs. Game 2 winner Game 10 Friday, Nov. 17     Game 3 winner vs. Game 4 winner Game 11 Wednesday, Nov. 15      Game 5 winner vs. Game 6 winner (7 p.m., ESPN2) Game 12 Friday, Nov. 17     Game 7 winner vs. Game 8 winner (6 p.m., ESPN)  Semifinals (at Madison Square Garden) Game 13 Wednesday, Nov. 22      Game 9 winner vs. Game 10 winner (tba, ESPN= ) Game 14 Wednesday, Nov. 22      Game 11 winner vs. Game 12 winner (tba, ESP= N)  Finals (at Madison Square Garden) 3rd-Place Game  Friday, Nov. 24 Game 13 loser vs. Game 14 loser Championship    Friday, Nov. 24 Game 13 winner vs. Game 14 winner (tba, ESP= N)  Barnum Hopes Fade  The Longhorns' hopes of getting Greg Barnum, the great center prospect who left Tennessee after his freshman year, are fading. Vol coach Phil Fulmer has refused to give Barnum a release, which would for= ce him to pay his own way for a year if he comes to Texas as things now stand. Since he would be a walkon, it also would require him to meet UT's transfer guidelines for regular students. As a regular student transer applicant with one year of college behind him, he would have to have 24 hours of C grades or above to transfer to UT. Under Fulmer, Tennessee football players have the worst graduation rate of any of the major NCAA Division I powers. Barnum was a good high school student who might have 24 hours of C or above grades at Tennessee. If he does, he would certainly have been one of the to= p student-athletes on the Tennessee team.  UT Baseball Players Sign  The pros have signed three UT baseball juniors  =01) second baseman Tommy Nicholson, relief ace Charlie Thames and shortstop Todd West =01) plus a to= p recruit in catcher Scott Heard of Rancho Bernardo, Cal. Junior pitcher Phil Seibel is still negotiating with the pros, but has not signed so far.  Basketball Recruiting  Guard Carlos Hurt of Alief Elsik has committed to Louisville. The Longhorns were recruiting him, but their primary target for their only remaining scholarship is 5-11 T. J. Ford,  who led Fort Bend Willowridge to the Class 5A state title. Ford, one of the nation's top point guards, is strongly considering the Longhorns. But teams like Kentucky and Duke are also under strong consideration. Maurice Williams, a 6-1 point guard at Murrah High School in Jackson, Miss.= , also is considering Texas. Williams and Ford are both rated among the top four point guards in the country. Texas already has a commitment from 6-10 center Chris Wright of Redwater. With only two seniors on the team, coach Rick Barnes has only one more scholarship to give unless some underclassmen leave the team.  Aldrich Makes Olympic Team  UT track and volleyball star Erin Aldrich made the U. S. Olympic Team Sunda= y, finishing second in the high jump with a 6-3 leap at the Olympic Trials in California. Aldrich was a senior last season, but she gave the Longhorns some good publicity at the trials, wearing her UT track uniform.  How About Those Odds?  It's been so long since Texas has been a pre-season favorite in every regular-season game that I frankly can't remember it. It probably was back = in the glory days of Darrell Royal. But there is an early line from the Imperial Palace in Las Vegas that alrea= dy has posted early odds on three of the Longhorns' key games. The Imperial Palace has the Longhorns favored by 7 points against Oklahoma = in Dallas, by 6 points against Colorado in Boulder and by 9.5 points against t= he Aggies in Austin. I thought the Boulder game might be the only one this season where the Horn= s would rate as a pre-season underdog. I also thought the game against the Sooners in Dallas was the second toughest game on the schedule, and the Agg= ie game was in the running for the third toughest test. So, if Texas is a pre-season favorite in those three big games, I think I c= an guarantee you that when the Imperial Palace publishes the odds for the remaining Longhorn games, UT will be favored in each of them. That, of course, doesn't mean Texas will go undefeated, but I always prefer to be favored and that's what the Longhorns will be heading into the season in all 11 of its games. If they stumble early, all that will change, so let's hope they don't stumb= le early =01) or at all.  The 90's - A Mixed Bag for Texas and Nebraska  The Longhorn football team has had a lot of success historically, but the 1990s weren't all that great. Nebraska fans might disagree, however. The Huskers went 108-16-1 in the 90s= . That was the second highest win total ever recorded in a decade. Florida State went 109-13-1 in the 90s to set the record. But Nebraska went 1-3 against Texas in the 90s. If the Cornhuskers had won any of those three games they lost to the Horns, they would have tied FSU f= or=20 the most wins in a decade. If they had won two of them, they would hold the record.  Baseball Recruit Shines  Vincent Sinisi, one of the Longhorns' prize baseball signees, led The Woodlands to the Class 5A State Championship last month. He pitched a six-h= it 11-1 victory over powerful Duncanville in the simfinals, then, after a four-day rain delay, hit a two-out double in the sixth inning to score the winning run over Corpus Chrisi Moody in a 3-2 championship game. Speaking of baseball, the Longhorns have signed another lefthanded pitcher. He is Brantley Jordan, 6-0, 190, of Texarkana JC and formerly of Round Rock= . He was 11-0 last season and he has two great pitches =01) a 90 mph fastball=  and a hard-breaking curve. He was a freshman at Texarkana, so he has three year= s of eligibility remaining.

2022-04-12 18:40:52+00:00,true,5,"  Scott asked for some assistance on the booking of the LGS deal and the impact  it would have if we unwound certain hedges. To help me better understand the  impact this would have, I need to understand the way we originally booked the  deal.   David, you and I have talked about this some, but I still don't have  all the info I need.  (Let me know if Scott, Craig and Farzad have already  figured all this out and I'll drop it, but to my knowledge they still need  help figuring this all out).  Hopefully my thoughts outlined below will help  you understand what I'm looking for and why.  As I understand the LGS deal, ENA pays an annual $1.35 MM to utilize the  assets, including storage; ENA gets to keep value generated (including  summer/winter spread) up to $1.5MM, then it is shared 50/50; however, LGS has  to know about and agree with any hedges we put on to lock in a particular  spread.  When Structuring booked this deal in January, summer/winter spreads  were locked in for the entire period we have the deal (through 2003);  however, it is my understanding that LGS has only been made aware of the  front year hedges (which I understand have been changed around a bit since  the beginning and that's o.k.).      What I need to know is--how was this deal booked?  When the $1.35 MM payment  goes to LGS, is that covered through the hedges that were put on?  How  exactly do the dollars flow between books?  I think this will help us figure out what would fall out If Scott removes  certain forward hedges and what risk he would take on.  It seems to me that  he would be at risk for whatever spread we had locked in originally, but I'm  not sure exactly how this would show up.  Basically, it seems as if Scott is  at risk with the hedges on, that if the actual spread is wider by the time  LGS is informed of the injection/withdrawal schedule (or LGS begins pushing  us to put on hedges), he would lose; likewise, it seems that if he takes the  hedges off and the actual spread comes in tighter, he would lose.   Conversely, if he takes the hedges off and the actual spread comes in wider,  I think he would win.  Anyway, I want to get together on Monday and go over  this with the three of you and figure this all out.  Please let me know if  10:00 Monday morning (7/31) works for you, then I'll ask Kim to get a  conference room.","Scott asked for some assistance in the booking of the LGS deal and the impact it would have if we unwound certain hedges.

2022-04-12 05:45:15+00:00,false,5,"  riday July 7, 11:43 am Eastern Time  Company Press Release  SOURCE: Columbia Gas Transmission  Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction Process With FERC  FAIRFAX, Va., July 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Continuing its quest to promote creative  regulatory policies, Columbia Gas Transmission, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission to consider an interactive, Internet-based pipeline capacity auction process that enhances Columbia's current open auction process.  In a first of its kind filing, Columbia proposes a ``bid/offer'' system for  selling capacity similar to on-line natural gas commodity trading systems.  The filing was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is  consistent with sentiments expressed in FERC's Order 637, which encourages companies to voluntarily submit ``new and innovative approaches''  to capacity auctions. Since the filing is not required under Order 637, Columbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance  filing made June 15.  ``Under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party  that places the highest value on it,'' said Carl Levander, vice-president of Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission. ``Even though we  conduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties often wait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the current  process is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the  auction is closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid.''  According to Levander, Columbia's proposal addresses these concerns by moving  to an enhanced, Internet-based interactive auction that takes into consideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in  capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter-term contracts.  Under Columbia's proposed ``bid/offer'' system, Columbia would ``offer'' (via  its electronic bulletin board) sales terms for all its available firm  capacity. Customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the  quantity and a sale is immediate and binding. If Columbia offers discounted capacity, the customer can counter-offer with a different rate. Or, if  Columbia offers maximum rate capacity, then a customer can counter-offer with  a different term length. Columbia can match the highest bid, subject to a  present value process, and the sale is immediate and binding. At any time  before a binding sale, the customer can change or withdraw its bid.  Columbia's ``bid/offer'' auction proposal meets the six basic principles  outlined in FERC's Order 637.       *     Columbia's auction has predictable timing since the auction will           begin each day at 9:15 a.m. (EST) and all available capacity will be           posted prior to 8:00 a.m. (EST).     *     The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non-           discriminatory basis.     *     The auction is user-friendly since it will use Columbia's existing           EBB format. All information concerning rules and procedures will be           made available on the Internet.     *     The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since           bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to           each capacity package made available.     *     As is Columbia's current practice, winning bids and the bidder's           identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection           criteria were applied.     *     The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all           bids (without the bidder's identity) will be available for review to           all bidders through an Internet-based system.   ``We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity  auction format is 'transparent, verifiable, and non-discriminatory' to all  parties as well as innovative in design,'' Levander said.  Levander said the proposal not only meets the Commission's principles, it is  based on feedback gathered from customers, who expressed a desire for transparent market information; shorter auction periods; an ability to  withdraw and change bids; and a real-time, immediate closure process.

2022-04-12 13:13:50+00:00,true,6,"  Hi, Tony Borelli the recruiting writer here. (the guy you just talked to)  Below I've pasted the text of your brief interview/profile blurb for the Enron recruiting web site. It consists of a main section and a short ""callout quote"" to be set apart from it, maybe in a different typeface.  Please review it ASAP, and reply to this email, either approving it as is (which I would love) or listing any changes that I need to make. NOTE: Please list any changes separately, rather than editing the text directly.  I ask that you focus on looking for any errors of fact, revelations of proprietary information, statements that will genuinely make someone look bad, or other such serious problems.  The informal style and tone, the general content, and the length have all been predetermined, and they need to match all the other blurbs we're doing for the site. So I'd ask that you not focus on those issues or change those parameters, and that you avoid doing any wholesale rewriting unless you think it's absolutely unavoidable.  Please be brave! Keep in mind that whole platoons of Enron communications and legal specialists will review and edit everything carefully before the public ever sees it. And of course, since this will appear only in web format, even after it ""goes live"" it will never really be permanent.  Thanks for all your help! --Tony TEXT IS BELOW:   John Lavorato Managing Director (trading and risk management) Enron North America  I started in Calgary in 1995, building our Canadian natural gas and electrical power trading operation from scratch, and I left as president. It was absolutely awesome. I had the time of my life. I hired the people I wanted, with very little supervision, back when gas and power trading was in its infancy, and today we're the biggest market maker and risk manager there. These days, as many people know, we're using that same expertise to create liquid markets in many other products, from broadband capacity to paper pulp. So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in Canada-to help build revolutionary new businesses.  But what some people might not realize is that even in our established gas and power trading operations-where we're by far the dominant player-it's hugely interesting and complicated, with a million variables to figure out, from the weather to the available storage capacity in Montana. You can't ship natural gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other commodities. And it's not like trading bonds, where you sit around waiting for the Fed. If you like solving incredibly complex problems, and you're very good at it ... get down here! We need you!   <JOHN'S CALLOUT QUOTE> Enron's not a place where you can hide-or where you'll be hidden. If you can't get it done, you won't fit in. But if you can, and you work hard, you'll get noticed, you'll excel, you'll get paid, and we're going to love you.","Hi, Tony Borelli the recruiting writer here. (The guy you just talked to).

Martin has spent the last four months supporting EBS.   His primary project  has been development of a simulation model for analyzing the capability of  the media-cast product running on the EBS network.   This type of analysis is  critical to understanding what types of bottlenecks we might encounter in  trying to service, for example, the Blockbuster deal.   Martin has already  come  up to speed so that he is able to largely replace an expensive  contractor from Lucent who is under contract to support this modelling  effor.   Prior to supporting EBS, Martin used his engineering skills (B.S.  Caltech, Ph.D. U.of Texas in EE) to create models of regional power  transmission networks in order to better understand possible congestion  constraints.    In our internal pre-ranking meeting we felt that Martin was deserving of a  rating of Superior due to his technical excellence, his excellent attitude  and work ethic, and his ability to move projects forward with minimal  supervision.

2022-04-12 07:39:31+00:00,true,6,"  Chonawee,  As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad  decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).  Suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an ATM option. You  sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot  = 100 shares). The price goes to  $100.   You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise  gives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxes on your option income (it's treated as ordinary income). The tax is 28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss against ordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes.   Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option  position as an offset.  The remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get the tax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have  income in the future (or capital gains).  Not so good.  By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options is a very interesting and difficult problem.  Vince       Chonawee Supatgiat@ENRON 07/10/2000 11:40 AM To: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: short-sell vs exercise  Below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere. It  explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised  but cannot be sold. (As we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call  option before its maturity). However, after taking Vince's comments on the  ordinary income/capital loss TAX offsetting issue, I think this is not a good  article anymore. I guess I could just throw this article away. :-) -chonawee   Short-selling is better than exercising your employee stock options  In general, the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when  you speculate that ENE is going down or its growth rate is extremely low. In  fact, when exercising the options, you are speculating that ENE would never  reach this point (plus interest) again during the 10 years maturity date or  until you leave the company. If you do not anticipate that, you should hold  on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your  exercise.  However, if you believe that ENE is reaching its peak. Then, instead of  exercising the options, you should short-sell (or sell) the stocks in that  amount. After short-selling, when you feel that the stock starts to go up,  you can buy them back (to cover), make profit, and still keep the options. On  the other hand, if the stock does not go down as expect, you can exercise the  options to cover your short position anytime.   Let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes, no dividends,  and zero risk-free rate. Suppose that ENE follows a simple sample path as  follow   If you exercise 100 ENE options with a grant price of 45 when ENE reaches 70,  you would earn  (70-45)*100 = $2,500. But if you short sell 100 ENE at 70, no  matter how much ENE is in the future, you can exercise the options to cover  the short position and still earn (70-45)*100 = $2,500. The advantage of  short-selling comes when ENE at the period 2 is 60. At this point, you can  cover your short position, get (70-60)*100 = $1,000, and still keep your  options or you can exercise the options and gain $2,500. That is, you still  keep the flexibility of your options when you short-sell. In conclusion, the  only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your  short position.   ","Chonawee, As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).

2022-04-12 13:57:00+00:00,true,6,"  Clayton,  We can discuss your request  when I come back to the office on Monday.  Regarding the trip to Portland. Such a trip requires an  explicit prior  permission from your boss, myself in his absence, or Stinson in my and Vasant's absence. In case you did not ask for such a permission before, the request  is denied.   Vince        Clayton Vernon @ ENRON  07/20/2000 03:12 PM   To: Vasant Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: status  Vasant-  I hope you had a wonderful vacation back home, and are rested and recovered  from the long flight back.  I wanted to give you an update of the EOL project, the Gas Model, and of my  intentions here at Enron.  Software (in compiled C on the Unix platform) has been developed and debugged  to listen to the EOL trades, process them, book them, and file them away. In  addition, software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on  a continual basis, and to store the entirety of open positions on EOL in a  dynamic matrix facilitating analysis. IT has yet to get back with me on how  the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit  purposes.  These data files are stored in a format for reading by Excel or by SAS, for  which I have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines  elucidating the structure of the data.  I am in the process of documenting all of this for you.  With regards the Gas Model and its slow performance on the Compaq, Dell has  agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the Compaq, to see if  the performance issue of the LP is related to the Compaq. I have been  researching this issue with IT here and with Compaq and Dell. The new machine  will be here any day now (no financial obligation to anyone), and I will be  able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is  Compaq-specific.  I am also in the process of documenting the Gas Model for you.  I've tried to do my best for you, Vasant, but I have been frustrated by not  only the death of my mother but some internal systems in IT here. Just the  other day, SAS could not open a full query of the EOL database because there  wasn't enough free space on the server's hard drive for the workfiles. In  discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power  trading, people whom I have known for over 10 years, they indicated they were  ubiquitous here. The power traders have similar PC's to my new one, and they  have complained from Day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones.  Also,  there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses;  during my brief tenure here IT has gone through two differing proposals as to  how to address this. When I have been told of tools available for real-time  data harvesting, my requests for such have typically been met with ""well, we  have it, but we haven't really tested it yet."" An example is the weather: we  still do not record to disk the hourly NWS observations from the GOES  satellite.  My interests here are to help Enron to do well, because I will do well only  if Enron does well. These aren't empty words- my IRA is 100% invested in the  Enron stock fund. I believe my best contributions to Enron will be in the  areas of systems as well as modeling, and the difficulty working in the  Research Group, in terms of systems development, is that, frankly, few people  at Enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems. We aren't  directly generating revenues for Enron, and we aren't really their customers,  except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses.  As it happens, Power Trading posted an opening for a Modeling and Forecasting  person, and I spoke with them and they asked me to take the job, reporting to  George Hopley. It is a wonderful opportunity for me, Vasant, as they are  interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their  traders' access to real-time fundamentals data. I was completely candid with  Kevin Presto regarding my shortcomings here in Research- I told him you were  disgusted with me because I repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines. They  also understand I have yet to be at Enron for 1 year, and thus may only bid  on a job with your permission. We agree the move is good for Enron; we all  work for Enron, and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but  merely permit it. They are comfortable with me- they have known me for years  as a hard worker, honest and unpretensive. They have already ordered a  state-of-the-art Unix workstation and server for me, and they have told me  they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful,  including hiring an Analyst to work for me. And, I have already been able to  teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis I  have learned here.  So, I am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening. It would be  a lateral move in position and salary, and I would commit to you to help you  in any way possible in the future with regards the Gas Model or the EOL  database. I will continue to work on their improvement, and complete their  documentation.  As it happens, I am away on Enron business in Portland Monday and Tuesday,  and will be back Wednesday. I had wanted to talk face-to-face instead of by  email, but Enron business supercedes- I am on a team designing the data  warehouse for floor trader support.  Clayton.

I understand this tax effect already when you explained it to me in your  office this morning. I agree with you that short-selling is not so good, especially for me,  because I have  a significant capital loss this year. I definitely don't want to increase my  capital loss carry over. (The short-selling idea might work for a person who wants to exercise his  options and  already has a huge capital gain this year. Unfortunately, it is not me.) Thanks again for pointing this out. The ""employee stock option with taxes"" problem sounds interesting. I will  think more about it when I have free time. -chonawee      Vince J Kaminski@ECT 07/10/2000 01:57 PM To: Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: short-sell vs exercise    Chonawee,  As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad  decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).  Suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an ATM option. You  sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot  = 100 shares). The price goes to  $100.   You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise  gives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxes on your option income (it's treated as ordinary income). The tax is 28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss against ordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes.   Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option  position as an offset.  The remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get the tax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have  income in the future (or capital gains).  Not so good.  By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options is a very interesting and difficult problem.  Vince      Chonawee Supatgiat@ENRON 07/10/2000 11:40 AM To: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: short-sell vs exercise  Below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere. It  explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised  but cannot be sold. (As we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call  option before its maturity). However, after taking Vince's comments on the  ordinary income/capital loss TAX offsetting issue, I think this is not a good  article anymore. I guess I could just throw this article away. :-) -chonawee   Short-selling is better than exercising your employee stock options  In general, the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when  you speculate that ENE is going down or its growth rate is extremely low. In  fact, when exercising the options, you are speculating that ENE would never  reach this point (plus interest) again during the 10 years maturity date or  until you leave the company. If you do not anticipate that, you should hold  on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your  exercise.  However, if you believe that ENE is reaching its peak. Then, instead of  exercising the options, you should short-sell (or sell) the stocks in that  amount. After short-selling, when you feel that the stock starts to go up,  you can buy them back (to cover), make profit, and still keep the options. On  the other hand, if the stock does not go down as expect, you can exercise the  options to cover your short position anytime.   Let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes, no dividends,  and zero risk-free rate. Suppose that ENE follows a simple sample path as  follow   If you exercise 100 ENE options with a grant price of 45 when ENE reaches 70,  you would earn  (70-45)*100 = $2,500. But if you short sell 100 ENE at 70, no  matter how much ENE is in the future, you can exercise the options to cover  the short position and still earn (70-45)*100 = $2,500. The advantage of  short-selling comes when ENE at the period 2 is 60. At this point, you can  cover your short position, get (70-60)*100 = $1,000, and still keep your  options or you can exercise the options and gain $2,500. That is, you still  keep the flexibility of your options when you short-sell. In conclusion, the  only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your  short position.

Please offer comments/approval.   5/31/00  I spoke with Mark Schrab in Logistics about the ANR ML7 Product that Kevin  Ruscettit would like to start trading and he wasn't able to dispell any  beliefs that this is a product that should not be traded, OTC or otherwise.  Mark explained that often times on this pipe there were cuts due to  operational constraints. I explained that we had drafted language to  contemplate these occurances. I then asked Mark what would happen if there  was a cut due to op constraints, and Mark explained that he would try to find  another Buyer along the pipe. I probed further, and found that there would be  no revision of the contract, nor a re-pricing of the transaction due to the  re-scheduling. I then read Mark the language under consideration (making sure  he understood that this was conceptual) and he agreed that the language  provided for something that we are already doing operationally. Mark had  never seen the language we propse for use for this Product.   I think Logistics may have been issuing an opinion on their point without  being fully aware of what we were attempting to offer, and I certainly don't  blame them for doing so - as we all make decisions based on the information  at hand.  I would like to proceed with this Product.  Dale  5/12/00  I spoke with Kevin Ruscetti, the trader, and Kevin has clarified for me that  the product he intends to trade on ANR ML7 is NOT Interruptable gas, but  rather subject to operational constraints like Socal Topock.

I also added a  secondary delivery blurb; please feel free to edit - and then I'll get this  in front of Kevin for his review.   The transaction is for delivery at the ANR Pipeline Company ML7  interconnect.  The volumes scheduled to be  delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on  the ANR Pipeline Company pipelines  based upon historical operating conditions.

2022-04-12 13:50:05+00:00,true,6,"  Vasant-  I hope you had a wonderful vacation back home, and are rested and recovered  from the long flight back.  I wanted to give you an update of the EOL project, the Gas Model, and of my  intentions here at Enron.  Software (in compiled C on the Unix platform) has been developed and debugged  to listen to the EOL trades, process them, book them, and file them away. In  addition, software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on  a continual basis, and to store the entirety of open positions on EOL in a  dynamic matrix facilitating analysis. IT has yet to get back with me on how  the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit  purposes.  These data files are stored in a format for reading by Excel or by SAS, for  which I have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines  elucidating the structure of the data.  I am in the process of documenting all of this for you.  With regards the Gas Model and its slow performance on the Compaq, Dell has  agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the Compaq, to see if  the performance issue of the LP is related to the Compaq. I have been  researching this issue with IT here and with Compaq and Dell. The new machine  will be here any day now (no financial obligation to anyone), and I will be  able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is  Compaq-specific.  I am also in the process of documenting the Gas Model for you.  I've tried to do my best for you, Vasant, but I have been frustrated by not  only the death of my mother but some internal systems in IT here. Just the  other day, SAS could not open a full query of the EOL database because there  wasn't enough free space on the server's hard drive for the workfiles. In  discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power  trading, people whom I have known for over 10 years, they indicated they were  ubiquitous here. The power traders have similar PC's to my new one, and they  have complained from Day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones.  Also,  there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses;  during my brief tenure here IT has gone through two differing proposals as to  how to address this. When I have been told of tools available for real-time  data harvesting, my requests for such have typically been met with ""well, we  have it, but we haven't really tested it yet."" An example is the weather: we  still do not record to disk the hourly NWS observations from the GOES  satellite.  My interests here are to help Enron to do well, because I will do well only  if Enron does well. These aren't empty words- my IRA is 100% invested in the  Enron stock fund. I believe my best contributions to Enron will be in the  areas of systems as well as modeling, and the difficulty working in the  Research Group, in terms of systems development, is that, frankly, few people  at Enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems. We aren't  directly generating revenues for Enron, and we aren't really their customers,  except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses.  As it happens, Power Trading posted an opening for a Modeling and Forecasting  person, and I spoke with them and they asked me to take the job, reporting to  George Hopley. It is a wonderful opportunity for me, Vasant, as they are  interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their  traders' access to real-time fundamentals data. I was completely candid with  Kevin Presto regarding my shortcomings here in Research- I told him you were  disgusted with me because I repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines. They  also understand I have yet to be at Enron for 1 year, and thus may only bid  on a job with your permission. We agree the move is good for Enron; we all  work for Enron, and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but  merely permit it. They are comfortable with me- they have known me for years  as a hard worker, honest and unpretensive. They have already ordered a  state-of-the-art Unix workstation and server for me, and they have told me  they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful,  including hiring an Analyst to work for me. And, I have already been able to  teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis I  have learned here.  So, I am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening. It would be  a lateral move in position and salary, and I would commit to you to help you  in any way possible in the future with regards the Gas Model or the EOL  database. I will continue to work on their improvement, and complete their  documentation.  As it happens, I am away on Enron business in Portland Monday and Tuesday,  and will be back Wednesday. I had wanted to talk face-to-face instead of by  email, but Enron business supercedes- I am on a team designing the data  warehouse for floor trader support.  Clayton.

2022-04-12 14:17:45+00:00,false,6,"  Dear All,  Yesterday, I mentioned to Vince the inhouse modelling capabilities and the  impact weather and the weather forecast can have on some of Enron's  operations and Risk Management positions. For this reason I have attached  three files, two of those show to tropical cyclones off the coasts of  Australia, i.e. Rachel and Drena. Tropical cyclones pose a significant risk,  and an early warning system can be part of a better risk strategy.  Please, note that the modelling system has been further improved since the  simulation was done.   Also, we can focus on another large problem and associated risk. Dust storms  can pose a significant risk to a number of industries, and the prediction  of such events has been very difficult, if not impossible. For this reason a  GIS database has been developed and coupled to the NWP model, which  allows prediction of such events in realtime. For the depicted event an  estimated 6 million tonnes of top soil was lost, and with it $$.   Maybe we can set up a conference call to discuss  * the above mentioned points * further improvments in forecasting based on the high resolution forecasts * weather and climate on a global perspective for Enron * how to further improve the forecast for Enron  Regards, Christian   PS: I tried to sent of this e-mail last night, but their appears to be a  limit of 10Mb, so I will send off the individual files....

2022-04-12 08:11:08+00:00,true,6,"  Hey Vince,  Thanks for your reply.  I'll see what becomes of the session and keep you informed.  As to the paper, Tim Crack and I have a revised version of the paper I gave you.  We have since found out that by using certainty equivalence, our model is more robust.  For example, if one has an asset pricing model that incorporates mean, variance, and skewness (Harvey and Siddique, JF June, 2000) and a binomial model that incorporates mean, variance, and skewness (Johnson, Paulukiewicz, and Mehta, RQFA, 1997), our model allows you to price options under the real world measure.  The benefit is that one can take all of the model parameters from historical data that is non-risk neutralized.    From a pricing perspective, there isn't a tremendous benefit in a mean-variance world (variance stays the same in risk neutral or risky measure).  However,in the mean-variance-skewness world, there is a benefit because we do not believe (although we're still hunting down an appropriate cite) skewness is the same under risk-neutral and risky measure.  Given we can only measure the skewness in our risky world, our model becomes much more significant.    I would certainly appreciate comments on the version of the paper you have and would also pass on the new version of the paper if you would like to see it.  Thanks again,  Tom ","Hey Vince, Thanks for your reply. I'll see what happens in the session and keep you informed. As to the paper, Tim Crack and I have a revised version of the paper I gave you.

The Unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we  have huge business risk if it blows up.    -->  Sally and Beth are going to document the steps we are taking to  maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure.           (everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds  like it should be a high priority)  2.  The database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to  long hours on the part of our back office staff.     -->  Beth is moving from Sun-O-S to Sun-Sularis which should allow us to  address the problem.  We have 4 contractors working on this and we are  expecting it to take 6 weeks.  Once this project is complete we can add  hardware and reduce the time problems.  3.   The traders need better real time management tools that ultimately  combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real  time risk. TDS was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the  traders needs.  This ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by  the               traders to meet their needs.    -->  Phillip Allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in  consultation with all the gas desks heads.   After this Beth should try to  come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs.  4.  The power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis.  This is  leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.  Beth has made  progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the  next 4 to 6 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working.  5.  Steve Natt  is going to put a plan together that meets with Kevin  Presto's approval that addresses our needs with respect to all-requirements  deals and volume management deals in the east.  6.  There will be no more business trips to London (somewhat kidding).  7.  Portland has issues with speed do to the fact that we still run their  books through an interface with Houston.     -->  John Lavorato will talk to Tim Beldon and Beth to determine whether its  worthwile to put servers in Portland.       -->  Since Tim was not in the meeting, John will make sure we are covering  all his needs.",4.

2022-04-12 09:08:45+00:00,true,6,"  Vince:  Thanks for breakfast last Friday.  I have been reflecting on a couple of your thoughts and very much want to take the steps forward you suggested. Let me take a shot at articulating what we said to make sure I have it right, and let me take a shot at making comments and suggestions.  Firstly, thanks for agreeing to bring MarketPoint to the attention of your outside equity people once again.  I understand that you are a go between, and I recognize and appreciate whatever efforts you are able to make.  I also recognize as you admonished that there are no guarantees here and that you can only do your best.  Thank you for that no matter what the outcome.  Secondly, your suggestion that our short term gas and electric models shoul= d be =01&click throughs=018 (my words intended to reflect the sentiment you expressed) on the enrononline.com website are absolutely consistent with th= e MarketPoint business concept and right up our alley.  I unequivocally want to move forward with that.  All that remains for MarketPoint to do so is to secure the venture capitalization to create the website delivery system to accommodate such click through and browser access.  We have the hard part done (the enabling technology) and we only lack the internet delivery system.  That should take a few months time after we secure the capitalization we need.  However, in the meantime, we would be prepared to put Excel spreadsheets with our scenarios in a web location where they can be clicked through from enrononline.com, and that could be done a bit soone= r if you and your enrononline.com people might be interested in providing the capitalization.  We already offer our North American electric plant data base on a click though basis through e-acumen.com, so that part of our infrastructure is already available (or imminent).  I believe they are goin= g commercial with our data product any time now.  Please let me know how we can consummate an agreement here.  Thirdly, I am surmising there might be a lot of value to Enron from applyin= g and demonstrating MarketPoint in the more nascent areas of your business where there are clearly few or no credible, comprehensive, pre-existing, proprietary fundamental modeling tools (e.g., metals, telecommunications, MIPS, agricultural commodities, water).  I would jump at the chance to work under your sponsorship to build an inherently new, previously nonexistent forward market model of a commodity such as copper, silver, gold, phosphate= , aluminum, potash, grain, or some other commodity you want to attack.  That would give you an objective =01&kick at the can=018 unfettered by the fact = that there are previously existing models you might want to compare against each other or against your own or that you have ongoing internal capabilities in those areas.  You have the prospect to get immediate value from such a mode= l in your embryonic metal or other trading business and to evaluate MarketPoint people and MarketPoint technology in a real life setting.  I should mention that I have a relationship with what I consider to be the premier mining/mineral processing group in the world (Michigan Technologica= l University).  Working with their metals/mineral processing professors, we could build a world scope forward copper, gold, silver, aluminum, or simila= r model in several weeks time that considers every facility in every supply chain in the world.  (Most metals have no more than several tens or a few hundreds of facilities in the world total, and those facilities are well known and accessible over the Internet or from trade associations or the government.  Our United States Geological Survey contacts should be very useful here.)  I really respect the Michigan Tech people I know.  They know the metal supply chains all the way from the geology and resource considerations at the extreme upstream end, the existing and prospective ways to mine and process that resource into such intermediate goods as pregnant leach solution, copper sulfide concentrate, gold cyanate, blister copper, solvent extraction/electrowinning intermediate product, and ultimately into final goods such as tubing, sheeting, wires, and other fina= l forms.  I would be prepared to send you a brief proposal and consulting contract to undertake such an effort, and I am confident I can get Michigan Tech to subcontract the data and domain expertise at modest cost.  They hav= e strong incentives to do something like this, for it connects them even more closely to the industry they covet.  If you access the Michigan Tech website, you will see a Dr. Carl Nesbitt (my brother) there as a mining and minerals processor person.  He has recognized world class skills in that field and is an Altos associate as well as a tenured Michigan Tech professor.  Fourthly, I agree with your sentiment that =01&Enron has been quite success= ful with what we have been doing=018 and that =01&We lean toward our own techno= logy.=018 I have the utmost respect and admiration for Enron and the technology and thinking you have operationalized in the past.  Notwithstanding that comment, I am sure Enron would not consider writing your own spreadsheet code to replace Excel or writing your own C++ compiler to replace Microsoft= =01, s or writing your own LP code to avoid purchasing one commercially.  There is simply no economic impetus to redo what comes from the commercial market better and cheaper--Enron buys rather than builds technology that augments your productivity, as you should, as long as it does not compromise confidentiality or competitive advantage.  Vince, MarketPoint is technology that augments Enron=01,s productivity and allows you to do what you want to=  do in the fundamental modeling area rapidly and accurately.  MarketPoint does not substitute for or devalue your internally developed technology; it augments and extends your people, data, and fundamental market insight. MarketPoint already has over 200 man years of cumulative development effort embedded within it, and it is just now becoming a custom =01&tinkertoy set= =018 approach that Enron can use to enhance your productivity and accelerate wha= t you want to do in the fundamental modeling arena.  Like Excel, it has passe= d the market test for almost twenty years across the entire industry (including Enron itself).  There are people in Enron today who I believe hold MarketPoint/NARG in high esteem in part because they are aware of its formidable and notable success over the past many years.  I hope you and your people can come to view MarketPoint in that way=01*-an automated productivity tool that can help Enron build and monitize proprietary conten= t faster, cheaper, and more accurately than you otherwise might and than your competitors can.  MarketPoint might save you a lot of time and money, and i= t might allow you to redirect your resources toward even more productivity an= d profitability, just as Excel and Microsoft C++ have done.  With the advent of e-commerce, your business is ultimately more =01&up for grabs=018 than i= t once was.  I must say I admire your early success and your early strong lead. However, barriers to e-commerce entry are smaller than barriers to traditional business entry, and ""branding"" is harder to hold.  You need to continue and in fact accelerate the first mover advantage and ""branding"" yo= u have so successfully built in the past decade and a half, and I believe tha= t top quality, high barrier-to-entry, rapid deployment technologies such as MarketPoint might help you do so.  I would even go one step further.  In th= e coming e-commerce era, technology such as MarketPoint will play even more o= f a role, and labor centric activities will be risky and (statistically) less successful.  We are pleased MarketPoint is emerging at the start of today's ""inter-vertical competition"" era because we believe all the winners such as Enron will ultimately need to use it if they are to be successful. Increasingly, the ""not invented here"" approach is likely to be supplanted with the ""cobble together elements of technology to make meta-technology"" because first mover advantage and branding will accelerate in value. MarketPoint enabling technology is perfect for that.  Fifthly, I should mention that if any people in your traditional gas and electric and other businesses want to use MarketPoint or Altos, please feel free to contact me with the opportunity.  We are eager to serve their or your immediate business needs as they encounter them in our traditional consulting mode.  That was the point of the earlier meeting Kim Watson organized, and that objective hopefully has not fallen by the wayside durin= g our private discussions.  After you have had a couple of days to think about the foregoing five points, let=01,s talk.  I think if you get the chance to work with me and MarketPoint, you will see that we are what we aspire to be--the ""Enron of the fundamental forward pricing world""-=01*the best in class.  A partnershi= p between two bests in class certainly makes sense.  I know you have no basis to believe that MarketPoint is best in class--it is new, and you and I have not worked together in close proximity.  I am eager to provide you a low cost, high value opportunity to determine whether that might be true.  Let'= s communicate by email or by phone in a week or ten days and see if we might get something going.  Dale Nesbitt 650.218.3069","Vince: Thanks for breakfast last Friday.

2022-04-12 14:25:52+00:00,true,6,"  It is my preference to have an aggregated VAR methodology for the metals  business as soon as possible (Version 1a). I do not want to poison progress  with my opiniion, but I think that the critical first step is to find a way  to aggregate positions in coarse buckets, perhaps sacrificing precision for  speed, based on ""rules"" that oerations can deliver, Research can stand behind  and Commercial will accept.,  and using an equally coarse VAR calculation  (the equivalent of AD-hoc VAR?) that can be delivered to the ""official books  and records"" on a daily basis.  This I believe would be acceptable for a 2-3  month time frame (at which time we get version1b) as opposed to waiting 2-3  months to implement a better process and have nothing in the interim.   Ultimately, I would look for Version 2a to be delivered and very defendable  by 1/1/01.  This will require indulgence and compromise on all fronts but I  cannot conceive of a better way.  Please let me know if this is consistent  with your understanding.  A critical point from my perspective is that the MG  commercial team and metal operations staff understand their role in making  this happen and willingness to accept the consequences.  I look for you to  take the lead as leader of the integration to do so.  If you need any input  from the rest of us to underscore the importance please let us know.  As I  alluded to on the phone, the people in Houston that have been involved in the  VAR process have been through an extraordinary period of detailed scrutiny of  VAR by commercial and have been hindered by the lack of basic understanding  by all parties as their responsibilities.  Given the distance and the newness  of the Metals personell, I fear that this could set us all up for some  surprises and some very uncomfortable communication, much of which is not  entirely necessary.
