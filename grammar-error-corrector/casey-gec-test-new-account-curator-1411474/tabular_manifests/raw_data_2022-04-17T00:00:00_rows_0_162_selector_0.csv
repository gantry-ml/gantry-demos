I'm not really accustomed  to talking business with my friends so let me say right at the beginning that  should you not be interested in the following, no harm, no foul.? The last  thing I want to do is create any discomfort but I really think that this  might be something that you'd be interested in.?  ? First, I'm organizing a show at Lawndale that will open on March 9th in the  Main Gallery called Colorforms.? It's going to include 3 painters - 2 from  Dallas and 1 from New York - and one sculptor - maybe you know her: Jessica  Halonen?? She's a core fellow.? I'm really excited about the show.? I did  studio visits with three of the artists this past weekend and they're all  working on great stuff.? I'm so jazzed about it, that I've been inspired to  write an essay and I haven't written about art in 6 years!Anyway, I'm trying  to do something a little more substantial for the gallery notes - more than  just a folded piece of card stock - and I told Lawndale that I would try and  fund-raise for it.? I'm mentioning this to you only because you have  expressed interest in the past in helping out if I am putting any projects  together.? I'm trying to raise about $250 to cover printing costs.? I'd also  like to have a DJ at the ! opening - maybe Patrick Phipps - but I need to  fund-raise for his fee too.? I know you're thinking ""what about DJ Grils  Baloy"" and I'd like to do it but I'm thinking that I need to circulate  amongst the guests at a show that I organized.?  ? Second, I'm co-chairing Lawndale's Mid-Century Market this year and so I'm  also fund-raising for it.? There is a formal letter/packet that has been put  together but I thought I would ask you a little less formally if you're  interested in supporting the event.? Last year the Market did quite well  based on booth rentals and admission.? This year we're focusing on increasing  the number of donors to the event which has traditionally been small.? There  are several levels of support with varying benefits at each level.? All  proceeds from the event go directly to Lawndale's operating budget. ? As you can tell, I've been increasing my involvement with Lawndale, trying to  help them get through this period of growing pains.? I regret the fact  that?these events - Colorforms and the Market? - are happening so close  together purely from an ""asking"" point-of-view, but they both seem to have  ""John and Angie"" written all over them.? However, if this just isn't a good  time for you to be doing this sort of thing then I completely understand.?  Nonetheless, I hope that they might pique your interest.?

Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided  the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be  adjusted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but  others will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be  multidimensional. There will be no formal leader of the teams because each  member is responsible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC  group that you are in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process  for consideration.  - The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the  commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework. - Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened  awareness of RAC issues. ""De-silo-ization"" . - All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment. - Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude  among the teams. - Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect. -  Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions will  require more frequent informal meetings. - There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of  credit, market risk or our portfolio. - All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offer to  help out if needed. - If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen. - Encourage weak links in team to perform. - Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business  unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement. - If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it  with your supervisor. - Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC  and compensation processes.  The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a  catalyst to the recent reorganization there. You can have an impact.  This process should begin immediately.

We have received FERC's notice of the application (Docket  No. CP01-69), and will be filing an intervention before the February 20  deadline.  Southern Company Services has contracted for the full 700,000  Mcf/day of capacity for a term of 20 years.  The project calls for about 59  miles of 36-inch pipeline and a 9,000 HP compressor station at a cost of  about $94,343,700.  As part of its application, Petal also submitted pro forma tariff provisions  and rates for firm and interruptible transportation services and asked for  authority to charge negotiated rates.  Petal also requested approval of  certain deviations from the pro forma transportation agreement for the  contract with Southern, apparently to allow Southern to act as agent for its  affiliated operating electric utilities to apportion capacity among them.  Please advise if you have any issues with Petal that should be made a part of  our intervention.  The certificate application is 635 pages, not including  another 778 pages for the environmental reports, so I'm not going to request  a copy unless someone indicates a desire to review it.

As I see it (refer to the attachment for more information), we might conduct,  at best, five sealed-bids over the next three months. However, for each of  the bids there may be more than 10 lots in each bid. Looking at the attached  Notice of Solicitation as an example, we have 7 separate blocks for suppliers  to bid having up-to 3 bid scenarios for each block for a total of 21 lots for  this phase. The way I see it, future soliciations will follow a similar  model.   Having said this, an alternative to the current language would be to have 5-6  sealed bid opportunities with a 20-25 lot limit for each bid.

Months utilitzed do not need to be consecutive, but if a deal  is up on DealBench in any day during a calendar month, that month will be  inlcuded as part of the three month period.

Our general recommendation is that the number of lots should be around 10 but if there are situations where it makes sense to have more than 10 lots, we would not have a problem with it.

As I see it (refer to the attachment for more information), we might conduct, at best, five sealed-bids over the next three months. However, for each of the bids there may be more than 10 lots in each bid. Looking at the attached Notice of Solicitation as an example, we have 7 separate blocks for suppliers to bid having up-to 3 bid scenarios for each block for a total of 21 lots for this phase. The way I see it, future soliciations will follow a similar model.   Having said this, an alternative to the current language would be to have 5-6 sealed bid opportunities with a 20-25 lot limit for each bid. Does this work for you or does this complicate the process for your group?   Please advise....

As we discussed, this email will serve as the framework for our pilot arrangement.  As soon as we receive an email confirmation from you, your team will be able to add deals to the DealBench platform.  3-month access as a standard user (15 sealed-bid deals with up to 10 lots for each deal) .  Months utilitzed do not need to be consecutive, but if a deal is up on DealBench in any day during a calendar month, that month will be inlcuded as part of the three month period.  EES will pay DealBench a fee of $22,500, with $7,500 due immediately, $7,500 due February 28th, and $7,500 due March 31st.  We would like to debit your RC directly to avoid billing overheads.    EES will solely control and be responsible for all business transactions that it conducts on the DealBench platform.  As such, DealBench assumes no liability for any EES business transactions conducted on DealBench.  We believe you will realize significant value from DealBench and look forward to working with you.  As you know, I am going to be happy when we do a Live Auction for you and save you some significant money.  Please confirm, with your RC number that you are IN with this arrangement. We also would want to explore further the larger opportunity - I will try to allocate some-one to work on that one with you next week.

2022-04-17 22:25:21+00:00,true,5,"  Hi all,  I just wanted to sum up our discussions from yesterday.  Enron Global Assets is considering using DealBench for hosting virtual datarooms for the divestiture of 32 international assets. The projected total number of documents will be in the region of 3500. DealBench has offered to host these datarooms at a cost of $25k per dataroom. This is on the basis that you are hosting all 32 datarooms, as we have worked some steep discounts into the pricing. The term of the dataroom hosting services under this offer is for the year 2001.  We have also offered to help with the transition of the data to the improved dataroom platform once that is in place sometime in Q2.   You have mentioned that a few documents that you intend to upload are bigger than 8MB. We have discussed that we can lift the current file size ceiling to greater than 8MB. I just want to make you aware that for users of the platform with slower connections it will be extremely time consuming to download these files. Even under ideal circumstances it will take al least 5 minutes for a 15MB file to download. For users with slower connections it will potentially seem like the download has failed, even though the download is still in progress. This could result in a lot of calls to you and our help-desk.  As I mentioned it might be of value to you to have professional assistance with the conversion of your paper documents to PDF. We are working together with a company in Houston that could help in the conversion process. From our experience file size and quality of scans are greatly improved by outsourcing this function. This is especially true if one is performing an OCR process on the TIFF files during conversion to PDF.   In the light of the urgency of your projects it might be a good idea to start the dataroom preparation process as soon as possible. May I ask why you suggested to wait until March to get back in contact with us ?  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call at 713-345-4147. We are very excited in helping you to deliver a world class solution.  Thanks  Tobias Munk ","Hi all, I just wanted to sum up our discussions from yesterday.

From talking to Steve Kleb its pretty clear that a significant amount of work is involved in getting actual accounting entries at an account level and splitting it into separate business events.

Also, may I get a copy of the 1999 statistical report from you?  Thanks for your help.  Gina     ",Welcome back. All the statistical data is on the Investor Relations website. I don't have an extra one. Investor Relations Drafts is a supplement and has in the past worked with me to get any data they don't already have and to review the content. From: Gina Taylor/ENRON
2022-04-17 22:06:55+00:00,true,5,"  Hi all,  I just wanted to sum up our discussions from yesterday.  Enron Global Assets is considering using DealBench for hosting virtual  datarooms for the divestiture of 32 international assets. The projected total  number of documents will be in the region of 3500. DealBench has offered to  host these datarooms at a cost of $25k per dataroom. This is on the basis  that you are hosting all 32 datarooms, as we have worked some steep discounts  into the pricing. The term of the dataroom hosting services under this offer  is for the year 2001.  We have also offered to help with the transition of the data to the improved  dataroom platform once that is in place sometime in Q2.   You have mentioned that a few documents that you intend to upload are bigger  than 8MB. We have discussed that we can lift the current file size ceiling to  greater than 8MB. I just want to make you aware that for users of the  platform with slower connections it will be extremely time consuming to  download these files. Even under ideal circumstances it will take al least 5  minutes for a 15MB file to download. For users with slower connections it  will potentially seem like the download has failed, even though the download  is still in progress. This could result in a lot of calls to you and our  help-desk.  As I mentioned it might be of value to you to have professional assistance  with the conversion of your paper documents to PDF. We are working together  with a company in Houston that could help in the conversion process. From our  experience file size and quality of scans are greatly improved by outsourcing  this function. This is especially true if one is performing an OCR process on  the TIFF files during conversion to PDF.   In the light of the urgency of your projects it might be a good idea to start  the dataroom preparation process as soon as possible. May I ask why you  suggested to wait until March to get back in contact with us ?  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call at 713-345-4147. We are  very excited in helping you to deliver a world class solution.  Thanks  Tobias Munk ","Hi all, I just wanted to sum up our discussions from yesterday.

2022-04-17 16:03:43+00:00,true,6,"  As many of you know, I ran the Las Vegas Marathon this past weekend.  The race (and the weekend) was one of the best experiences of my life.  My only goal was to have fun and complete the marathon without re-injurying my hamstring.  First the bad news.  The first 8 miles was not comprised of rolling hills as I had once thought.  Instead, it was a gradual uphill climb . . . for 8-9 miles.  Once we hit the downhill, there was a nasty headwind that really slowed you down.  Can't imagine how fast it would have been absent the head wind.  Finally, the temperature swing was between low 40s (start) to 70s (finish).  Now that's out of the way, the people running it were AMAZING.  Everyone was pushing the person next to him and when one person could push ahead, everyone else cheered him/her on, particularly at the finish.  Can't tell you how many guys told me to get moving because they knew I had more in me. At mile 23, I was beginning to feel the effect of the heat and a more experienced marathoner ran by me noticing that I had stopped to eat a banana and said ""GET MOVING.""  I caught up to him and thanked him as I passed.  I ran the last 3.2 miles at a 7:30 (or so) pace, largely due to him.  I felt really strong (except for the fatigue at mile 23) and could have run much faster.  I opted early on to stick to a conservative running plan.  If I got a PR, great.  Most important was to finish this marathon and to keep running without pain.  It takes less time to improve your running (to attain that PR) than it does to come back from an injury.  And so I have learned . . .  Sorry this is so long.  It was such a GREAT experience that I know you all understand (as fellow athletes or as coaches) so I wanted to share.  Thanks again for all of your advice.  I followed it to the letter (even the most absurd).  It was much appreciated.  For those who are traveling to Austin in two weeks, I'll see you there!

If you like, we can set up a time to discuss these comments.  As I mentioned on the phone, many of the comments directed at Part 1, Item 1 are due to the fact I do not have a signed copy of Consent to Assignment.  I am searching for a copy at this end, but if you have ready access, a copy would be appreciated.  Part I  1.  The base contract defines the party GE is contracting with as the ""Purchaser"".  LJM2is the Purchaser under the base contract. I understand assignment of the contract by LJM2 to E-Next is under consideration and was supposed to have occurred in December. I do not have a copy of the Consent signed by GE or any other signed documents indicating that the assignment has taken place.  Assuming the assignment has taken place, according to the unsigned documentation I have, Enron North America Corp. should be replaced as the contracting party in paragraph 1 by E-Next Generation LLC as the party that is contracting with GE and is the Purchaser.   As I understand the draft Consent agreement, Enron North America is supposed to be the Agent for E-Next and is not the Purchaser.  This is consistent with the cover page of the draft CO No. 2.  Revision 5 to the Change Order does not quite succeed in making the correction.  It should say ""... between General Electric Company (""Seller"") and E-Next Generation LLC (""Purchaser"") dated May 31, 2000 (the ""Agreement""), Purchaser, acting through its Agent, Enron North America Corp., hereby amends ..."".  However, CO No. 2 with this correction to paragraph 1 should not be signed by GE until GE has agreed to the assignment to E-Next.  Otherwise, the signed CO. No. 2 could, by itself, be construed as consent by GE to the assignment.  2.1  Delete the added language that begins with the words ""on or prior to the Guaranteed Unit Shipment Date(s)..."".  Because Unit No. 1 is going to storage and the customer controls when it is released from storage and when it gets to the jobsite, the risk of late delivery originally assigned by the contract to GE has shifted to the customer.  This is recognized in section 5.5.2 of the contract which states that if GE is directed to ship to storage, for the purpose of assessing LDs and final payment, GE's delivery obligation is deemed fulfilled.  The original guaranteed delivery dates are no longer relevant. If the Unit 1 equipment is close enough to being ready for delivery that it must be shipped to storage because the customer cannot take possession of it, it does not matter if we ship to storage before or after the contract delivery dates.  2.2  The comment to 2.1 applies to this paragraph also.  Further, there is no guaranteed delivery date for non-Major Components as long as delivery of that equipment does not impede the continuous progress of installation.  2.4  Delete the words ""unless caused by Seller or its Subcontractor"" at the end of this paragraph. Otherwise, the paragraph first takes a responsibility away from GE and then re-imposes it.  As I understand it, there is a significant possibility that some cosmetic deterioration to external surfaces will occur to the equipment while it is in storage.  This is a function of the storage conditions and GE is responsible for those conditions.  2.6  Delete in its entirety the second sentence which reads ""Passage of title and warranty obligations of Seller with respect to the Unit 1 Equipment remain unchanged under the Agreement"".  Article 5.5.2 makes it clear that Purchaser's direction to place equipment into storage causes title to pass and delivery for the purposes of LDs and final payment to occur even though Purchaser has not taken physical possession of the stored equipment.  5.5.2 also indicates that all expenses incurred by Seller as the result of placing equipment into storage shall be payable by Purchaser. These expenses include any extension of the Primary Warranty Period that results from storage.  The deleted sentence should be replaced by: ""The parties agree that the Primary Warranty Period for Unit 1 Equipment placed into storage shall be determined in accordance with Article 14.1.1 of the Agreement except that the Primary Warranty Period shall end for the gas turbine and generator no later than March 11, 2004 and for the balance of the Unit 1 Equipment on March 31, 2004 unless extended by mutual agreement.""  2.10  We will insure the equipment to 100% of its purchase price.  The policy in place will have a $300,000 deductible, for which GE will be responsible.  2.11  Seller's responsibility for both damage and loss, not just loss, should pass to Purchaser.  The rest of the changes are acceptable.  Regards,  Jeff     ","Brian, I didn't get the revised draft.

Presently the following occurs: i) Calgary origination covers eastern industrials and some structured LDC  business (eg. asset mgmt or unbundling issues); ii) Calgary trading covers one month Empress sales to the LDC's; iii) Geoff and his middle marketers cover Union and Consumers for mid market  storage or transport plays in Ontario (or the US for Union and Consumers  assets in the US), plus US gas supply into Panhandle or ANR transport held by  the LDC's.  Geoff of course also does the Dawn, Parkway etc. trades.  Calgary  origination also does some mid market deals with Union.    Canada origination is in the process of hiring a director and manager for the  Toronto office to cover gas eastern LDC's and industrials.  Offers went out  to these individuals last week.  Here's what we would see as the going forward arrangement: i) The new Toronto based originators, with support from Calgary origination,  will handle all structured products with the eastern LDC 's.   This would  include longer term transport and storage arrangements and unbundling  services, risk management products, and term commodity sales or purchases,  physical and financial.   Basic middle market deals within Canada would be  done by the Toronto originators working with Geoff, just as any middle  marketer dealing with the trader.  There would be on-going coordination with  Geoff et al in Houston to make this work; ii) Calgary trading will continue to cover one month Empress sales; iii) All gas supply for the LDC's bought to be put onto their US pipes, will  be done out of Houston by Geoff et al.  Toronto would be advised of any  transactions just to be kept up to date on the LDC's actions; iv) Shorter term (seasonal or less) storage or pipe positions taken by Geoff  to manage trading positions in Ontario or the border points, or to create  opportunities, will continue to be done by Geoff et al.  For any longer term  positions, Toronto origination and Geoff will work together to ensure value  is maximized.  Laura, please give me a call (403-974-6741) with any questions on this.

CA  Ed/Kay - Here is a brief description of what I am trying to accomplish with  the confidentiality agreement.  enovate, L.L.C. currently has no direct  employees, but rather employees of Peoples Energy Resources Corp. (wholly  owned sub. of Peoples Energy) and Enron North America working on its behalf.   As such, this includes access to proprietary and confidential information of  enovate, Enron and Peoples, such as certain curves, positions, transactions,  sendout information, etc. I would like to have each individual employee  working on behalf of enovate sign a Confidentiality Agreement that  effectively prohibits them from sharing any of the above information of  enovate or its affiliates ( I am assuming this would cover Enron and Peoples)  with anyone outside of enovate or its affiliates.  I need to preserve the  ability to share information with affiliates since we rely on them to support  a large portion of our business.    Secondly, I need your legal opinion as to the realistic enforceability of  such an agreement and what form that enforcement might take or whether the CA  only serves as a scare tactic.  The reason being, there is a Peoples employee  that I think is in the process of looking for another job.  He is also the  one that I am most concerned about sharing confidential information.   Therefore, I am hoping to force his hand and see his reaction to the CA.  Kay has a large amount of history with our business and other CA's that have  been thrown back and forth.

2022-04-17 20:27:18+00:00,true,6,"              ?EDMUNDS' REVIEW      Nissan's hardy Pathfinder has always been our vehicle of choice for seeking a  new path to the premium outlet center. Though the exterior may exude that  tough-guy outdoorsy image, the interior has always been comfortable enough  for the dilettante woodsman who doesn't like to get his nails too dirty.  Though the old 3.3-liter V6 engine provided acceptable levels of low-end  grunt, the coarsely produced 170 horsepower it made was meager when stacked  against newer competitors.    So revel, all you who seek liberation from urban ennui -- the Pathfinder is  finally energized by a stouter V6, based on the Maxima sedan's stellar  powerplant. When mated to a five-speed manual transmission, the 3.5-liter,  DOHC V6 engine produces a mighty 250 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of  torque. Matching it to an automatic tranny will usurp 10 ponies but add 25  foot-pounds of twist, still ample power to haul plenty of equipment and go  mountain climbing, as well as merge onto freeways without fear.    The Pathfinder comes with rear-wheel or part-time four-wheel drive, the  latter of which provides a shift-on-the-fly transfer case that can be engaged  at speeds up to 50 mph. On LE models, an automatic All-Mode four-wheel-drive  system can be specified for 2001, giving you one more reason to skip paying  the extra tariff the Infiniti QX4 commands. All-Mode operates in 2WD,  automatic 4WD, 4WD-Hi and 4WD-Lo, all selected using a simple rotary knob on  the dashboard.    We've long admired the Pathfinder for its excellent ride and handling,  further enhanced by solid unibody construction. The interior, one of the  friendliest of any SUV on the market, is spruced up for 2001 with an updated  instrument panel. A new dual level center console with a padded armrest and  12-volt power source will organize all your gewgaws.    You can choose from three trim levels -- the XE, which for the 2001 model  year comes with standard power windows, mirrors and locks, and a security  system; the sporty SE, which gives you a choice of automatic or manual  transmission along with sporty trim; and the top-of-the-line LE, which  includes fog lights, Bose audio system, and fake wood accents.    All models come standard with 16-inch wheels, full-size spare tire, a CD  player and ABS. Side airbags can be ordered as long as they are contained in  leather-wrapped seating, which is available only on SE and LE. Those same  models, when power is transferred to the drive wheels via an automatic  transmission, can be equipped with a mobile entertainment system, which  includes a 6.4-inch flip-down LCD screen, video player, and ports to plug and  play a PlayStation 2 (And we all know how important that will be after  Christmas, don't we?). A ""Birdview"" navigation system, shared with the  Infiniti QX4, is also available, but we don't recommend it. While the  ""Birdview"" perspective is interesting, teensy, tiny, little, itty-bitty  buttons control the thing, along with some of the climate control functions.  Get a map.    Items that remain static from last year include a substantial maximum cargo  carrying capacity of 85 cubic feet (surprising for what appears to be a  relatively small vehicle). Some of this space, in our humble opinion, should  have been used to alleviate the still-cramped rear accommodations.    Despite a few quibbles, we're thrilled that Nissan finally rectified the  Pathfinder's main problem -- horsepower. With this updated, competitive  package, we're betting fat rebates and dealer incentives have gone the way of  the Dodo.

I am discussing this particular situation with  Keith Dodson inside the newly formed EEAS  - we will call you to discuss.    Things I think/recommend should happen regardless:  1)  Your idea of a coordination meeting is good.  The combined efforts of our  teams....., taking 7 months to get the generator uncrated and inspected...,  is not spectacular.    2)  I think that ........, in the right way........, we need to insure that  if anyone asks Janet Dietrich or Delainey whether we were impeded on the  Electrocities project, and......, whether we would really be willing to  litigate a claim based on that..... I want to make sure our answer doesn't  change.  Don't take that the wrong way, but......, I believe there are people  inside ENA and the old EECC that have rolled their eyes in front of  Westinghouse regarding our claim for LD's.  I don't think we have  Westinghouse believing we were impeded (because the Enron team isn't  convinced).  Westinghouse's cooperation might be different if they sincerely  believed that Enron was ""impeded"".  Kay Mann's input that Enron was really  impeded weighs strong on my mind (I put a lot of weight in Kay's opinions).   If you could get that clarified/reinforced/defined at that level......, we  can insure we are on solid ground in talking w/ Westinghouse.  Kay makes a  good point that it doesn't matter what ""...the team believes...."".  I  politely disagree and feel that if we convinced ourselves.......,  Westinghouse's cooperation might change.    3)  I think that Kay (and John Schwartzenburg's team if Kay desires) should  advise if any official notifications should be made to Westinghouse (e.g., we  haven't really ever formally ""rejected"" delivery.... maybe we want to rely on  the correspondance that has evolved, and...... a new letter now would weaken  our case..... but....., I believe you would want Kay (and maybe John if Kay  desires) to advise if any such notification could strengthen our position.  )  Keith and I will call.

Tax Assessment Letter - Livingston County personell (Pontiac site) have  requested that Titan LLC enter into a tax assessment agreement related to the  Project.  Mark Gershon (Piper Rudnick) is preparing a draft letter for the  County using the Assessment Agreement form utilized in our Kendall County  Special Use Permit as a template and based upon discussions between myself,  Rusty, Mark, and Warren Schick/Robert Tillota of ENA's tax department.  Mark  will forward a draft of this letter to us for review/comment before we submit  it to Livingston County.

ComEd Interconnection Agreement - ComEd recently (1/30/01) sent me their  boilerplate draft Interconnection Agreement (IA) for the Kendall LLC and  Titan LLC projects.  Under ComEd's tariff we have 90 days to execute the IA  in order to maintain our position(s) in ComEd's interconnection queue.  I  have told ComEd that we would likely modify their boilerplate IA to make it  resemble the IA signed by ENA and ComEd in Q2 2000 on the Des Plaines LLC  project in Will County, Illinois.  My preference would be to wait a few weeks  on starting negotiations on either IA so that we can attempt to finalize a  sale of member interests with either  PSEG or Entergy.

2022-04-17 17:52:58+00:00,true,6,"  Jim,  I have just reviewed Tabors' proposal for a hybrid solution to RTOs and I do  not feel that, at this point in time, this does the ERCOT desk any good  whatsoever. It is simply a continuation of what the PUC has already seen from  his counterpart, Dr Oren, and does not meet my expectations for a feasible  market. I have not been impressed with Tabors understanding of our trading  business and do not feel that this latest model forwards our efforts at all.  The purpose of the meeting on the 15th is to review the real-time congestion  management mechanisms currently proposed and not a forward hybrid market. If  we have two associates who are saying the same thing we do not achieve our  goal of changing this situation. Furthermore, it simply means we end up  signing on to a flawed market design which, I am sure, is not in anyone's  best interest; commercially or politically! We have not been implicated in  the failings of California's design because we did not sign up to the initial  proposal there. It would be very foolish to sign up now to an equally flawed  model.  I would like to have a quick meeting to discuss this so that we can forge  ahead with the ERCOT gameplan. I will not accept a bastardised version of the  current proposals as a solution for this market. It does not allow either EES  or ENA to operate productively and will ultimately fail. I am confident we  can get over any hesitations we have using other market experts to present  the case and I know that there has been great interest in this. This should  also fit in well with the efforts being led by Jeff Brown on the RTO side and  is consistent with our discussions Tuesday.  I trust you will be able to accommodate us with a request to hammer this out.  The business opportunities far outweigh the 'issues' we have with ditching  Tabors' model in this market. We believe that having Hogan present at the PUC  will undoubtedly forward our various causes in a much more effective manner.  Furthermore, his cache with the utility crowd is an important consideration  in getting them to understand our business and transact with us.   I look forward to hearing from you and trust we can get this resolved today  so we can get back to business.  Thanks,  Doug ","Jim, I have just reviewed Tabors' proposal for a hybrid solution for RTOs and I do not feel that, at this point in time, this does the ERCOT desk any good whatsoever.

I am discussing this particular situation with  Keith Dodson inside the newly formed EEAS  - we will call you to discuss.    Things I think/recommend should happen regardless:  1)  Your idea of a coordination meeting is good.  The combined efforts of our  teams....., taking 7 months to get the generator uncrated and inspected...,  is not spectacular.    2)  I think that ........, in the right way........, we need to insure that  if anyone asks Janet Dietrich or Delainey whether we were impeded on the  Electrocities project, and......, whether we would really be willing to  litigate a claim based on that..... I want to make sure our answer doesn't  change.  Don't take that the wrong way, but......, I believe there are people  inside ENA and the old EECC that have rolled their eyes in front of  Westinghouse regarding our claim for LD's.  I don't think we have  Westinghouse believing we were impeded (because the Enron team isn't  convinced).  Westinghouse's cooperation might be different if they sincerely  believed that Enron was ""impeded"".  Kay Mann's input that Enron was really  impeded weighs strong on my mind (I put a lot of weight in Kay's opinions).   If you could get that clarified/reinforced/defined at that level......, we  can insure we are on solid ground in talking w/ Westinghouse.  Kay makes a  good point that it doesn't matter what ""...the team believes...."".  I  politely disagree and feel that if we convinced ourselves.......,  Westinghouse's cooperation might change.    3)  I think that Kay (and John Schwartzenburg's team if Kay desires) should  advise if any official notifications should be made to Westinghouse (e.g., we  haven't really ever formally ""rejected"" delivery.... maybe we want to rely on  the correspondance that has evolved, and...... a new letter now would weaken  our case..... but....., I believe you would want Kay (and maybe John if Kay  desires) to advise if any such notification could strengthen our position.  )  Keith and I will call.

2022-04-17 20:26:58+00:00,true,6,"  Did you know that one out of every 10 cars and trucks sold in the U.S. is a  Lexus or a Toyota? With the new Highlander, Toyota will easily cement itself  as one of the best-selling brands in North America. How can we be so sure?  Because the Highlander represents an optimum blend of three utilitarian types  of vehicles: the station wagon, the minivan and the sport-utility vehicle.  Based on the same platform as the Lexus RX 300, which itself is based on  modified Toyota Camry mechanicals, Highlander is longer, taller and wider  where the wheels meet the pavement than the Lexus. Despite its greater size,  the Highlander is lighter than the RX 300, so acceleration should equal or  better its upscale cousin. Braking will likely prove impressive, too.  Highlander comes standard with four-wheel disc brakes equipped with  electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist (which maximizes  braking power during a panic stop).  Highlander is rated to tow 3,500 pounds, when properly equipped. Helping to  meet that specification is the same 3.0-liter V6 that resides under the hood  of the RX. Making 220 horsepower at 5,800 rpm and 222 ft-lbs. of torque at  4,400 rpm, the V6 features Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i).  The standard engine, also using VVT-i to maximize power and efficiency, is a  2.4-liter inline four making 155 ponies and 163 ft-lbs. of twist. The  four-speed automatic transmission provides a ""snow mode"" for easy starts on  slippery surfaces.  With 7.3 inches of ground clearance (6.9 on front-wheel drivers) and a fully  independent suspension front and rear, Highlander isn't designed to tackle  tough terrain. But it'll work great during heavy snowfalls. Toyota's Vehicle  Skid Control (VSC) system, which includes traction control, is optional, and  is designed to recognize when the Highlander isn't responding to the driver's  steering inputs. VSC will then apply selective braking to bring the truck  (car?) back under control.  In the event it fails (not likely, but possible), Highlander protects  occupants with whiplash injury lessening (WIL) front seats, five three-point  seatbelts equipped with automatic and emergency locking retractors (ALR/ELR),  front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters and ISO-FIX child seat  anchors. Daytime running lights and side airbags are optional.  Inside, Highlander delivers 38.5 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear  60/40 split folding seat in use, and a whopping 81.4 cubes when it's folded.  Air conditioning, CD/cassette combo stereo with six speakers, cruise control,  tilt steering wheel, bottle holders, and grocery bag hooks are standard.  Opting for Limited trim gives you JBL sound, automatic climate control,  remote keyless entry, woodgrain interior trim, alloy wheels with full-size  spare, fog lights, privacy glass and other upgraded features. Leather  upholstery is available on V6 models.  Toyota is planning to sell 70,000 Highlanders in calendar year 2001. We'll  bet demand outstrips supply.  B","Did you know that one out of every 10 cars and trucks sold in the U.S. is a Lexus or a Toyota? With the new Highlander, Toyota will easily cement itself as one of the best-selling brands in North America. How can we be so sure? Because the Highlander"
