Did you get my e-mail about running into Mary Eyre in the gym in San Mateo? Spooky.  I've seen her a couple more times but I haven't spoken to her; I get in the ""properly pumped"" zone.  Turns out there are a lot of classmates on the peninsula - David Park, Frank Knifsend, Mary, and James Regan come to mind immediately.  No real news here.  We haven't broken anything in the house in a while, so either we're getting luckier or we're due.  Both jobs are very busy right now so the weekends are for recuperating.

2022-04-09 04:00:46+00:00,true,3,"  Hi Stinson, as per our discussion, which we will expand upon when we meet  later today, my currently role in Hamachi is better characterize as  combination of deal support (from the engineering perpsective), facilitating  my work with Jean Mrha (via Erik Simpson) on the initial load forecast and  general requirements document development.  None of this is technical by any  means.  If anything, it is more like engineering consulting (from deal  perspective) by EBS Research to John's group.  I will bring it up with John  tomorrow night about bringing our technical guys on such road trips so that  they can get involved with his group even though no optimization modeling  work may need to be done. For this I will use Samer and/or Chonawee but we  need to be certain that they are available on such on-call basis as stated  below.  John is very clear and specific about who he ask to be at such  meeting and when, etc.  Normally he does not want any deviations. So if we  put someone on such jobs, they have to be able to travel on-call anywhere,  any place. That is the time pressure he is working with.     He want me to be the primary contact for such deal support effort. But I will  ask to bring along our technical guys on such trips so that they are plugged  in etc... I will recommend this to John for the next deal that he is planning.

Given the recent spate of high-profile denial-of-service and hack attacks and the large number of people who have signed up for this newsletter before this first edition has been even published, it is clear that security is a major concern in the IT community  as it should be.  With technology now being looked upon as a profit rather than cost center, IT departments face more pressure to keep critical systems up and running  as well as secure. No chief information officer or network manager wants to have to tell the CEO that their e-commerce site has been broken into and customer credit card data copied. Stories like that tend to stick in a potential customer=01,s mind more than an expensive Super Bowl ad.  It=01,s hard enough to keep up with the latest new technologies, never mind latest security patch for your operating system or e-commerce application. But we=01,re here to help.  Once a week we=01,ll publish a list of patches and alerts from all the major vendors and security organizations with links to the source. We=01,ll also provide other (hopefully) useful resources for the security- conscious IT manager.  Comments and suggestions are always welcome! Send mail to jmeserve@nww.com.   Now on with the latest patches and alerts:   Security glitch hits Foundry switches  From this week=01,s Network World: A security problem has cropped up in Foundry Networks=01, ServerIron switches that make the devices susceptible to denial-of-service attacks.  Read the story: http://www.nwfusion.com/archive/2000/89454_03-06-2000.html  Download the patch: http://www.foundrynet.com/bugTraq.html ********   New version of Apache Web server released  The Apache Server Project released Version 1.3.12 of the popular Apache Web server this week. The new release fixes what Apache calls a cross- site scripting problem that could allow malicious HTML tags to be inserted into client-side scripts. Download the new version at: http://www.apache.org/dist/ ********   Problem with Linux htdig package  Both FreeBSD and Debian are reporting a problem with the htdig package that runs on their respective platforms. The problem is with the htsearch and could allow a user to read any file on the local machine accessible to the user ID that the script is running under (which in most cases is =01+nobody=01,).  For more information from Debian: http://www.debian.org/security/  to download a patch from FreeBSD: http://www.freebsd.org/ports/ ********   nmh Linux package patched  Versions of nmh prior to 1.0.3 have a vulnerability that could allow malicious users to modify the MIME headers in a mail message that may cause nmh=01,s mshow command to execute arbitrary commands. A patch is available at: ftp://ftp.mhost.com/pub/nmh/nmh-1.0.3.tar.gz ********   Zombie Zapper 1.1 available  Zombie Zapper 1.1 helps shut down the Troj_Trinoo denial-of-service client on Windows NT and Unix machines. More information at: http://razor.bindview.com/tools/index.shtml ********   Problem with MySQL password authentication  According to the makers of FreeBSD, a vulnerability in the MySQL database server (prior to Version 3.22.32) could allow anyone that can connect to the database to access it without a password.

2022-04-09 08:44:50+00:00,true,3,"  NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: MIKE JUDE and NANCY MEACHIM on APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS Today's focus: Full circle: ASPs the new Big Blue? 03/15/00  Dear Wincenty Kaminski,  Today's focus: Full circle: ASPs the new=20 Big Blue? --------------------------------------------- By Mike Jude and Nancy Meachim  The terms =01&ASP=018 and =01&IBM=018 may have more in common than being th= ree- letter acronyms.  Remember Big Blue of the early =01+60s? The vision, then, was centralized computing. Mainframe computers hosted complex, expensive applications that end users accessed via dumb terminals. IT infrastructure, especially memory, was expensive and needed to be controlled. With computing resources centralized, IBM reasoned, they were easier to maintain.  Of course, IBM got it wrong, in that computers became a cheap commodity. And users weren=01,t happy simply using dumb terminals. They wanted a bigger share in all that technology offered. So, as memory prices fell, so did the idea of central control. Dumb terminals were transformed into intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data. The glass house populated by white-smocked technicians went out of fashion.  Looking back on those times, many of us would shake our heads and wonder how IBM could have been so wrong. But maybe Big Blue wasn=01,t so far off. Thanks to the advent of application service providers, centralized computing is making a comeback. ASPs offer centralized application management.  The market started as a way to offer the benefits of Server Advertisement Protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy. But ASPs now host all kinds of applications, including small, multilicensed programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand. But, the principle remains the same: Central control makes support much more efficient and usually cheaper. How about that, IBM?  To be fair, the dynamics of an ASP are very different from old centralized mainframe operations. An ASP doesn=01,t just host and support an application for general distribution over an in-house proprietary network. Unlike the IBM vision, an ASP is very dependent on network service. It is also very sensitive to service levels. In the =01+60s, if the mainframe let you down, you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an hour or so, and your only recourse was that white-smocked fellow. Nowadays, users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a minute. And woe to the ASP who brings down a customer operation. The world of the ASP is much more complex than that of the old =01+60s shop.  However, if one could magically transport a computer user from the =01+60s to the wonderful new 2000s, would it seem all that different to him? In an ideal ASP world, a la Scott McNealy=01,s vision, users would sit down at a semidumb terminal, download the application du jour, and start working. What did the =01+60s user do? Kind of the same thing!  So you are probably wondering, what is the point? Just this: IBM=01,s problem was leaving the customer out of the equation. And look what happened. Customers rebelled. They didn=01,t buy IBM=01,s spiel. It became the =01&in=018 thing to hate IBM. Why? Because the guys in white smocks couldn=01,t spell service and didn=01,t care about customers.  To be successful, ASPs need to learn from the past. They need to tattoo service on the forehead of each of their employees. There are too many choices, today, for customers to put up with inferior service. That=01,s one big difference from the =01+60s. Customers now can literally choose any service provider in the world. Just being big doesn=01,t cut it these days.

2022-04-09 08:10:46+00:00,false,3,"  NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: AMY LARSEN DeCARLO on STORAGE IN THE ENTERPRISE Today's Focus: The lure of the SAN 03/14/00  Dear Wincenty Kaminski,  Today's Focus: The lure of the SAN --------------------------------------------------------------- By Amy Larsen DeCarlo  E-business is changing how businesses value information. Information has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their market rivals. Companies use intelligence to identify new markets and make contact with prospective customers. In this media-saturated era, information itself is packaged and sold as a product. This makes the ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a continuous basis absolutely crucial.  Companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage implementations.  With estimates for Internet storage capacity needs doubling every three months, IT professionals are hungry for a scalable solution to help them consolidate control of stored information. They often look to storage-area networks (SAN) as a better option to manage their information storage systems than distributed models.  Today, most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses file servers to process I/O requests from end users and other application servers. In this model, all requests for data go through the file server that owns the attached storage disks, and only one file server can tap data on a particular disk via a SCSI bus.  This model has several shortcomings.  First, the amount of data a server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the bus, which limits the capacity of a single file server.  Second, because the server processes each I/O request, it risks becoming a bottleneck. Third, this server model carries some daunting availability limitations, because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks.  If that file server or any of its SCSI connections fails, then users and other application servers lose access to the stored files.  This model carries other major disadvantages.  Distributed file servers rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a crawl.  Finally, this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from both a logical and a physical perspective.  File server based storage systems are distributed throughout the enterprise, so it is often difficult to assess current and future capacity needs.  And because these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to the disk array, they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage.  SANs promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file servers, largely through consolidation of control.  These specialized storage networks claim higher availability, faster performance, centralized management, and by their architecture, the capability to remove bandwidth-intensive data backup and recovery operations from the LAN. This frees up the LAN for normal data communications and ensures smoother back-up operations.  Using high-speed transports like Fibre Channel, SANs offer a high- performance network optimized for moving storage data. SANs also make way for new storage implementations like LAN-free backup. And, because Fibre Channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers, SAN devices can be widely distributed, but also centrally managed as one network.  Yet, as was the case with LANs in their younger years, SANs are still developing. Vendors are still working out major product interoperability issues, while companies deploying SAN technology struggle with how to merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both together. Ultimately the hope is that, like LANs, SANs will develop into a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial benefits at lower costs.  Given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10 times the acquisition price for the equipment, the consolidated management capabilities of a SAN may deliver the biggest benefit to business.

2022-04-09 08:15:24+00:00,true,3,"  NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: DAVE KEARNS on NOVELL NETWARE Today's Focus: Btrieve free ride ends 03/14/00  Dear Wincenty Kaminski,  Today's Focus: Btrieve free ride ends --------------------------------------------------------------- By Dave Kearns  NetWare has shipped with Btrieve (originally a flat-file database system, now grown into a full-fledged relational database system) since the days of NetWare 2 some 12 years ago. Many independent software vendors have relied on this and constructed their NetWare applications to use the built-in facilities Btrieve afforded.  Originally licensed from its creator, Softcraft, Novell bought Btrieve outright in the late =01+80s, then sold it off 10 years later to some of the original developers, now incorporated as Pervasive Software. Pervasive has, essentially, retired the Btrieve name in favor of ""Pervasive SQL 2000,"" a true relational database system which nevertheless still purports to support applications written to the Btrieve 6.x specification.  A major change has been introduced in NetWare 5.1, however. There is no longer an unlimited-use version of the database included. Novell still uses Btrieve technology for (among other things) its installed products database (sys:system\products.dat is the file), but NetWare 5.1 includes only a two-user license for SQL 2000  enough for the administrator to add new products and services, but not enough for any Btrieve-based applications the network might be running.  There is an unlimited-use version of SQL 2000 included, but it=01,s an evaluation version only. It will time out after 90 days. Full-use licenses may be purchased from Pervasive Software (or your software vendors may provide them), but unsuspecting network administrators could be caught off-guard when applications stop working.  For the adventurous, there is an unlimited-use version of Btrieve 6.10 included with the NetWare 5.1 distribution. But Novell admits it hasn't tested the software with NetWare 5.1, it may not work, and  the real killer  most current applications (such as Computer Associates ArcServe) require Btrieve 6.15.  Check the applications you're using before doing that upgrade to NetWare 5.1, and calculate the additional costs of obtaining the requisite number of SQL 2000 licenses. Then, decide if that's what you want to do, or if switching to a different application is the better choice.

For the current gas  day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)

To that end, Jeff McMahon and Tim Despain had Rick  Buy, Bill Bradford and I meet with eight members of the Moody's team.  The  questions centered around policy and procedure in the Wholesale businesses.   We discussed VAR, stress testing and potential credit exposure.

I want you to know how critical your contribution was to the discussion and  will continue to be as the bar gets raised.

2022-04-09 05:17:30+00:00,true,3,"  Dear all,  Attached is Anjam's reasoning and final version of the UK PPI PLLU model.   The UK Inflation Book's main exposure is to two PPI indexes - the PLLU and  the DZCV through year 2010. Both are PPI Output indexes with very comparable  baskets. The only significant difference between the two is the presence of  energy in the PLLU (7.6%). The model in use escalates the two indexes by the  same factors. However, with the energy price fluctuations in recent years  different models for the two indexes would reflect better the nature of their  drivers. Anjam concentrated on the PLLU index first and he will shortly  construct one for the DZCV based on the same methodology, but without the  Brent Crude curve.   The new model achieves the two main objectives of the PPI curve: it is  significantly more robust and stable than the existing one, and it is  considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients. This will result in us  having more confidence in our monthly P&L as well as less fluctuations.   Best regards,  Martina  x34327      Anjam Ahmad 10/03/2000 11:59 To: Martina Angelova/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: New Update on PPI Model for Inflation Book  Dear all,  I followed up on the suggestions of happening babe at the conference call as  follows:-  1) USE LESS DATA  Unfortunately, kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less  robust, in fact dramatically so, and so eliminates the possibility of using  less data.  The model tested was the RPI(month+15) & Deviations from  long-term average for Brent Crude.  The r-squared and F-statistic collapsed  by eliminating the first 12 months of data.  2) DEVIATIONS IN CRUDE VARIABLE  Shifting the crude explanatory variable backwards and forward by 3 and 6  months did not alter the model goodness-of-fit parameters dramatically and so  my suggestion is that we stick with the following model:  PLLU[t] = a.RPI[t] + b.RPI[t+15] + c.BrentCrudeDeviations[t] + Constant  3) TESTING MODEL WITH SINE WAVE  To gauge the response of the model to wildly-varying RPI forward curve, a  sine wave of period 3 years for RPI was input into the PPI model.  The result  was as expected; PPI pre-empts the moves in RPI by about 8 months.  The  magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced.  This shows that if we had  more detail in our RPI forward curve, then the PPI model would reflect those  peaks and humps adequately.    CONCLUSION  I therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates RPI, RPI[t+15]  and deviations of Brent Crude from long-term average.  The new model is  plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old PPI which is  depicted in blue.    Please note that all this analysis only applies to PLLU, and that a separate  study will be needed for the DZCV PPI index.  Regards,  Anjam x35383  ","Dear all, Attached is Anjam's reasoning and final version of the UK PPI PLLU model.

2022-04-09 09:30:10+00:00,true,3,"  Hi Vince  I met with Thomas this morning (I gave you his CV before, though I don't know  if you had time to read it).  He's extremely interested in moving to Enron,  and accepts that our work is far less academic than his postdoc research,  although far broader than his investment banking quant experience.  He  remains interested, and emphasised he wants to stay close to the traders, but  wants to look at new markets and products.  I think we should seriously  consider hiring him.  He is (understandably) reluctant to move to Houston,  but there's no doubt that there is plenty of (unnmet) demand for derivatives  pricing (and thinking) here in London.  Would you be interested in my setting up a videoconference in the next couple  of weeks so you have a chance to chat with him?  I'm meeting with him again  on Tuesday at an academic quant finance seminar organised by Lane at King's  College.  I've attached his CV for your reference.

There are three  worksheets labelled as follows:  'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".    The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed  at a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network. 'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current  gas day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was  in fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect  to the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that  we take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume' shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be  negotiated. 'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the ""Daily Change' worksheet.

2022-04-09 04:05:19+00:00,true,3,"  Hi Stinson, as per our discussion, here is the e-mail from Jim on the  subject.  I convinced Jim that this type of modeling effort is our gig and he  completely agrees.  As per Jim's suggestion, he and I will talk more on the  product while we are in Denver. I suspect that we will arrange for the vendor  to come to Houston and do a presentation on the product and install the  product on our machines.   As for additional development we should get John  Bloomer and Jim together in a meeting and hash out the requirements from John  Bloomer's perspective.  Using Vince's analogy, this tool allows us to deternime the size of the cargo  space needed for Fedex-like delivery (our streaming media products). Whereas,  the optical light path switching (DS-3, OC-3, OC-12 and OC-48) based trading  will reserve the underlying airline routes, etc.  So the packet based stuff  is looking at the required capacity from IP layer (Network and Transport:  level 3 and 4) requirements. The optical light path is Level 1 & 2 based  requirements.  That is this tool will allow John Bloomer to size (actually we  will do the analysis for him) the capacity requirement that he would need for  the products that he is developing.  That is my take on the difference, we'll find out otherwise.  Once I finish off this discussion with Jim in Denver, I suggest putting  Martin Lin on the job to find out more about the product and do the leg work  to arrange for vendor demo and software installation.  Martin will keep Samer  and Chonawee updated on the information that he gathers.  Martin please start  checking on the web about this company and other similiar produts. I will get  you contact number for EBS and the vendor as soon as Jim provides them to  me.    Avici uses this product. Avici is a next generation router vendor that is  selling Terabit routers. EBS is an investor in that company.

My belief is we can spin up a couple of your studs and develop  our own stuff faster @ a fraction of the cost.   Avici, used OPNET to develop  a circuit emulation model for their TSR and Cisco used OPNET for MPLS and DPT  modeling.  These guys are willing brides at this point.  We just need to  clearly identify their role in the network performance management and  modeling space.  We will have to talk more in Denver.

Barring the last-minute arrival of a qualified  buyer, the company plans to begin  ""de-orbiting"" the 66 satellites that make up the world's first low-orbit  system for wireless telephone service.    That means the first global satellite telephone network--variously reported  to have cost $5 billion to $7 billion--would be vaporized as its satellites, bumped by their thrusters,  plunge from 485 miles (781 km)  above the Earth to burn up over the ocean.  http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1004-200-1573481.html?tag=st.cn.1.lthdne  Online stock trading goes wireless  Add online stock trading to the list of Web activities soon to be untethered.

The leading auction house opened a  small-business exchange today  where companies can buy everything from computer printers to nail guns. But  the move is more of a change in marketing  than a sudden shift in focus, analysts say.  Business trades have been  quietly happening on eBay for some time, and its  format inspired many of the exchanges that have cropped up, such as  AutoExchange and Chemdex.  http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200-1573358.html?tag=st.ne.ron.lthd.1007-200- 1573358  NetTrends: Battle of the E-Marketplace  Everybody wants to be a marketplace. In sectors from cars to chemicals to food ingredients, companies are trying  to join all of  the participants into Internet-based markets for their industries in hopes  of making businesses more efficient. In some cases, they're taking the idea a step further, setting up virtual  markets that collect fees for all of the goods traded, creating what they hope are highly  valued companies in the process. Agricultural giant Cargill was the latest to join the trend, creating a  market for the $300 billion food industry this week.

There=01,s a new generation of videoconferencing end-point devices that provide business-quality pictures and sound for under $12,000.  We grabbed a box of popcorn and tested eight videoconferencing systems, using 384K bit/sec ISDN and IP connections.  In the category of videoconferencing appliances  that is, standalone systems that go in a conference room for group video sessions with colleagues or business partners  Polycom=01,s ViewStation MP was the clear winner.  The Polycom ViewStation provided outstanding video and audio quality. In addition, it was easy to install, configure and use.  In the category of PC-based products, which are especially good for virtual collaboration from your desktop, VCON=01,s MC800 was the hands- down winner, based on its high-quality components.  The beauty of these products is they allow you to have a real-time video image of the person you=01,re conferencing with in one corner of the screen, with the rest of the space available for data collaboration.  If you=01,re in the market for a system, be sure to get one with a Sony EVI D30/31 video camera; an unidirectional boundary microphone, like the Audio Technica; and a quality sound mixer. And look for remote administration and system management tools. For example, the ViewStation allows you to upgrade software, change settings, or change address book entries directly from the administrator=01,s system.  Most systems will allow you to transmit over ISDN or IP, but we found performance over IP was dragged down by IP=01,s overhead requirements. For the complete product review, go to: http://www.nwfusion.com/reviews/2000/0313rev.html  Of course, there=01,s more to videoconferencing than end points, so we whipped up an implementation guide that lays out the network topology, bandwidth and quality-of-service issues. http://www.nwfusion.com/reviews/2000/0313rev2.html  Based on our testing, the Reviewmeister says now is the time to start pilot-testing a videoconferencing system. Your chief information officer will love it when you tell him you can slash your company=01,s airline and hotel bills because you=01,ve got people from all over the company in virtual rather than face-to-face meetings.  Next week: We loaded Windows 2000 on a PC and a server and ran Gigabit Ethernet to the desktop. Guess where the bottleneck was?

2022-04-09 02:50:26+00:00,true,3,"  Stinson, I had a discussion with Jim and he said that the company's name is  Mill three. They provide modeling tools for Tiered QoS and the like for  network planning.  He said that the code is written in C and that we should  be able to work with it. He will get us the contact name and we can get a  presentation for us.  Jim said that he arranged for this before he met me and  learned of our (EBS Research) role in this matter. I made it clear to Jim  that John Griebling had asked us to set up this group to do modeling and that  we are in the process of arranging for 4 OR modeling experts to reside in  Houston. From now on Jim and I will work hand and hand on such issues along  with you to make sure that we initiate development efforts as soon as  possible to utilize Krishna, Samer and Co. asap...  I'll take care of arranging a meeting with these consultatants ASAP.  My involvement in Hamachi is through Jim Irvine. Jim and I are working very  well together due to our engineering background. Jim has been a network  (communications) engineer in the army for about 20 years.  For Hamachi, there  were gap analysis that needed to be done w.r.t. network reach and when and  where the network will be available (EBS' and Hamachi's). Additionally, we  would look at when Tom Gros wanted pooling points up and running, we would  then look at Hamachi's pooling point sites and come up with requests to  change dates or third party involvements.  For the most part, our efforts has been to interview Hamachi network  developers about their plans and put the data together in a manner that we  can summarize for John. Additionally, we've had two meetings with Sycamore  (they have offices in Denver) on their products and Brett gave a presentation  on his effort to Jim, etc.... More details later when we meet.

2022-04-09 00:52:53+00:00,true,3,"  Dear Friends and Family,  On April 15 and 16 I will be joining thousands of riders and volunteers on  the MS 150 which is a two day bike tour from Houston to Austin covering 182  miles dedicated to end the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis.   Multiple sclerosis is a disease that is total unpredictable.  Symptoms may be  mild such as numbness in the limbs, or severe paralysis or loss of vision.  Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 but the  unpredictable physical and emotional effects can be lifelong    My wife, Ilene was diagnosed with MS almost three years ago; at first I was  at a loss of how I could support her.  That was until I heard of the MS 150,  which is one of the greatest challenges of my life.  It is my choice to  participate in the MS 150, Ilene does not have a choice, as she has to live  with MS every day.   This will be my third year riding in the MS 150 raising money for the  National MS Society to fight multiple sclerosis. In 1998 my goal was simple.  It was to raise money and ride the 182 miles on my own. I succeeded in my  endeavor by completing the ride on my own steam and raising $6,000.  In 1999  I raised my goal to $10,000 and finished the tour.  Not only did I meet my  goal, but surpassed it by raising $15,000 to fight this devastating disease  with the help of my friends and family.  This year my goal is even greater!   My wife and I are once again asking for your help.  This year on the 2000 MS  150 bike tour, my goal is to raise $20,000.  Enron is a big supporter of the MS 150.  For the past two years we were the  largest bike team and biggest fundraiser of any corporate team nationally.   Last year we raised $310,000 with 300 riders.  Enron will match dollar for  dollar on all contributions donated in my name.

2022-04-09 12:04:28+00:00,true,3,"  Hi Paul/Cassim,  Further to our meeting yesterday regarding power options, that we may use to  capture short-term volatility from regulatory caps being adhered to or  broken, I have attached a spreadsheet that should assist in nailing down the  value.  ARBITRARY DISTRIBUTION The first issue to address is converting the price scenarios for the average  of the Q2-Q3 swap into a volatility equivalent.  This is achieved by fitting  a normal distribution that matches the one specified for mean and standard  deviation.  The graph below illustrates the method for the numbers discussed  yesterday.  In this example, the annualised volatility is coming up as  approximately 23%.    PRICING & IMPLIED VOLATILITY The pricing is as for a regular Asian option.

2022-04-09 23:03:06+00:00,true,3,"  Attached is an updated version of the daily file that I sent earlier this morning.  The only change is to the volumes for NIPSCO.  All other volumes should be the same as those in the earlier version.  sorry for any confusion.   The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 4/10/00 and  the following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as follows:  'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".    The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed  at a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network. 'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current  gas day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was  in fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect  to the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that  we take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume' shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be  negotiated. 'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the ""Daily Change' worksheet.

I reckon these models can be  checked in Houston now - the raw data is included (see attached spreadsheets)  and all the regression parameters and main statistics are displayed.  I  became interested in how far DZCV and PLLU should be below RPI and whether  this model is reflecting any reversion to the RPI level; I believe that the  forecasts are accurately reflecting this.  Please see graphs below:    Both models really need our RPI curve to be linked (at the moment I have just  copied the 2.3% number forward).  Because the auto-regressive error term is  not very important, we can run the models forward with reasonable  confidence.  As I mentioned, I don't think we can really run this model more  than 12 months, in fact, I think we should run for 9-12 months and blend the  next 3-4 months out with the long-term model.

2022-04-09 13:16:12+00:00,true,3,"  IP, Georgia-Pacific, and Weyerhaeuser    launch on-line marketplace     PURCHASE, N.Y., ATLANTA, and FEDERAL WAY, Wash., March    23, 2000 (PRNewswire) - International Paper, Georgia-Pacific    Corp. and Weyerhaeuser Co. today jointly announced that they    intend to develop a global business-to-business marketplace to    enable buying and selling of paper and forest products on-line.     The companies will take a leadership role to facilitate the utilization    of Internet technology to enhance service to customers and    increase efficiency with suppliers. The electronic marketplace will    create a foundation for common industry standards to simplify and    accelerate the adoption of electronic commerce across the    industry.     The marketplace will operate as an independent entity with its own    board of directors and management team. Initially, the three    founding companies will each have an equal equity position, but it is    expected that more partners will join the initiative. Based on    demonstrated success, the companies will consider taking the    entity public.     The paper and forest products industry in the United States ships    more than $200 billion worth of products annually. By working    together to establish an electronic marketplace, the three leading    companies in the industry believe they can benefit customers by    simplifying transaction processes, improving information flow and    increasing speed of delivery, thereby reducing costs. Providing    both procurement and sales functions means the on-line    marketplace will also enable participating companies to streamline    purchasing operations, reduce inventories, cut internal costs and    increase capital efficiency in the industry.     The three companies immediately will begin conducting a search    for a chief executive officer for the new operation and are assessing    potential technology partners to add state-of-the-art expertise to the    enterprise. The companies plan to promptly complete a definitive    agreement, finalize a business plan and enlist additional strategic    partners, including forest products companies and affiliated industry    firms.     John T. Dillon, International Paper's chairman and chief executive    officer, said, ""This is a substantial commitment on the part of three    industry leaders to develop a comprehensive electronic    marketplace for the forest and paper sector. As manufacturers,    marketers and distributors of a broad array of products, we will    collectively bring expertise and resources to this effort.""     A.D. ""Pete"" Correll, Georgia-Pacific's chairman and chief executive    officer, said, ""This is a bold move for the paper and forest products    industry. It is a defining step in our industry's positioning in the    electronic business-to-business marketplace. Our companies    immediately bring products and distribution capability through our    active, joint participation.""      Steven R. Rogel, Weyerhaeuser's chairman, president and chief    executive, said, ""Rapidly evolving technology is dramatically    changing the global marketplace. This initiative will aggressively    shape the electronic marketplace in the paper and forest products    industry to ensure our industry meets the current and future needs of    our customers. It will also promote better relationships with other    trade partners, such as suppliers.""      Executives representing the three companies who will serve as a    steering committee include Marianne M. Parrs, executive vice    president, International Paper; and John N. Balboni, vice president -    e-business, International Paper; David J. Paterson, vice president -    electronic commerce, Georgia-Pacific; and Robert A. Renner,    director - electronic commerce, Georgia-Pacific; and Mack L.    Hogans, senior vice president - corporate affairs with acting    responsibility for electronic business, Weyerhaeuser; and Darien E.    Roseen, vice president, strategic planning, Weyerhaeuser. Morgan    Stanley Dean Witter has been selected to provide financial    consulting services for this initiative.     Until the electronic marketplace is up and running, which is subject    to appropriate governmental and other approvals, the companies    will continue to conduct sales and procurement activities as normal.    International Paper's previously announced relationship with    PaperExchange.com will remain part of the company's    e-commerce strategy.     International Paper is the world's largest paper and forest products    company. Businesses include printing papers, packaging, building    materials, chemical products and distribution. Headquartered in the    United States at Purchase, N.Y., International Paper has operations    in nearly 50 countries, employs nearly 100,000 people and exports    its products to more than 130 nations.     Georgia-Pacific, headquartered at Atlanta, is one of the world's    leading manufacturers and distributors of pulp, paper and building    products. It consists of two distinct operating groups -- The    Georgia-Pacific Group, which includes the pulp, paper and building    products businesses, and The Timber Company, which manages    4.7 million acres of timberland in North America. The company    employs more than 55,000 people at 500 locations in the United    States and Canada.     Weyerhaeuser Company, one of the world's largest integrated    forest products companies, was incorporated in 1900. In 1999,    sales were $12.3 billion. It has offices or operations in 13 countries,    with customers worldwide. Weyerhaeuser is principally engaged in    the growing and harvesting of timber; the manufacture, distribution    and sale of forest products; and real estate construction,    development and related activities.","IP, Georgia-Pacific, and Weyerhaeuser launch on-line marketplace PURCHASE, N.Y., ATLANTA, and FEDERAL WAY, Wash., March 23, 2000 (PRNewswire) - International Paper, Georgia-Pacific Corp. and We"

I really enjoyed our discussions, both at the technical level and otherwise.  I promised to send you an e-mail regarding possible dates for a visit to Enron. I delayed it for a week till my schedule was clearer. Let's see if we can get a match with your schedule - mine is rather terrible:  Friday, 21st of April looks good. But April 23rd is Easter Sunday, so that may make it difficult for some people at Enron to be around. Let me know if that is the case. I am willing to visit then, because the week after that I am scheduled to be in Japan and in the previous weeks I am all committed on Fridays.  Friday, 19th of May is the next possibility, but this probably is too far out. The main problem is that I am operating within a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this research. This window closes by the end of April, and it would be important for the student support funds to be in place then, so that I can make hard commitments to students and attract top talent. I am already reviewing files of students who have approached me for PhD advising, and I am in a mode of doing ""soft commitments to star-level students"" to get this research and its potential on their radar screen. Top students are highly sought after by advisors and I want to be an early player in this competition.  Does my visit to Enron have to happen before we can set up the project and student support at Stanford? If so, doing it before the end of April is important for getting top people. If the visit can happen after we get the ball rolling, then we can schedule it in May. I assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets going.

2022-04-09 07:46:28+00:00,true,3,"  Dear all,  I completeley agree with Ben that Treasuries are the most liquid and reliable  benchmarks. I also think that FMAs have their own advantages and  disadvantages.  However, it looks like it would be very difficult for us to avoid using LIBOR  as benchmark - at least to price anything related to Capital Markets (for  example, credit default swaps) . Our prices will always be different from  that on Capital Markets if we use benchmarks different from the Market.  As a half-way solution we can have different benchmarks - for example, use  anything, that we decide is closest to risk-free, to value products  significantly different from that priced on Capital markets,and LIBOR for  everything priced on Capital Markets .   We can adjust by manipulating other coefficients (event, liquidity,  recovery) for our purposes, but it looks like benchmark should be LIBOR.  To avoid negative default probabilites (for highly rated reference entities)  we can add cost fo repo and haircuts (as all bankers do).  Let us continue our discussion on this.

My preliminary conclusions  are as follows:  Recent turmoil in the Treasury market mostly hit 10 and 30-year bonds. Treasuries are still the most liquid curve, and that used by banks for  benchmarking risky debt. There is a considerable a liquidity/scarcity premium inherent within the  corporate-Treasury spread, which we are not taking into account. More  accurate measurement of this premium should allow us to calculate bankruptcy  prices based on Treasuries, which are consistent with the market.  All further comments are welcome of course.

2022-04-09 08:43:10+00:00,true,3,"  NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: PHIL HOCHMUTH on LINUX Today's focus: Will Linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop? 03/15/00  Dear Wincenty Kaminski,  Today's focus: Will Linux be a hit or miss=20 on the corporate desktop? --------------------------------------------- By Phil Hochmuth  So far this year, the buzz about Linux in enterprise networks has focused on servers and embedded systems, with the growth of Linux severs being most heralded. According to IDC, a research firm based in Framingham, Mass., Linux was the fastest-growing server operating system last year, with a 93% growth rate over the year before. Linux was the second most-shipped operating system in 1999 after Windows NT, capturing 24% of new licenses shipped.  As for the embedded market, Linux has emerged as an ideal platform for network appliances, because the system can be modified to handle specialized, dedicated tasks very well. Companies such as Cobalt Networks, Picazo and Progressive Systems have announced Linux-based appliances, ranging from Web servers to PBXs to firewalls.  But what of the open source hacker=01,s dream of =01&Linux on every desktop= ?=018  Sure, Linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever, with colorful, shrink-wrapped boxes of Caldera, Red Hat and Corel Linux now available at places like CompUSA. However, analysts have said that Linux=01,s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro areas of network servers and embedded operating systems.  According to IDC, Linux currently runs on only 4% of U.S. desktops. The hold Microsoft Windows has on the desktop market will remain strong, analysts say, despite such factors as Microsoft=01,s antitrust problems and the surging popularity of Linux.  Even some Linux executives are skeptical of their product=01,s desktop future. Recently, SuSE CEO Roland Dyroff downplayed Linux=01,s future on desktops. Dyroff said, =01&given the lack of applications available, we really can't claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet.=018  A recent survey by Survey.com gives more hope for Linux desktops. According to the survey of 1,640 enterprise network managers, open source operating systems are used on 10% of desktops, with the number jumping to a surprising 23% of enterprise desktops by 2002.  Despite the mix of numbers being thrown around, two important factors that will determine the success of Linux as an enterprise client desktop are: a standardized, easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) and available applications.  One company that is working to make Linux more user friendly is Palo Alto-based Eazel, which is designing a next-generation file management system and user interface to run on top of the Linux kernel. According to Eazel=01,s Web site, the company=01,s goal is to bring Linux to the mass= es and =01&do it in a way that appeals to today's Linux users and to mere mortals.=018  The company was founded by a group of former Apple executives, and is allied with the Gnome project, which has been doing extensive Linux desktop environment development for several years. Eazel is due to have a product out by the middle of this year. With an intuitive, icon-based file management environment, Eazel is hoping its user interface will be an improvement over the two current Linux GUIs, Gnome and KDE, and will help standardized the look and feel of Linux for =01&regular=018 users. For enterprise mangers who have already embraced Linux on the server side, this development will be worth keeping an eye on.  On the applications side, several office productivity suites have been available for some time, such as Sun=01,s StarOffice suite and KOffice for the KDE desktop. Corel has also ported its office products, such as WordPerfect, over to Linux to complement its own distribution of the operating system. While there have been recent rumors (started by Linux Care Vice President Arthur Tyde) that Microsoft is working on a port of MS Office to Linux, Microsoft officials deny this.  While Linux may never supplant Windows as the industry-standard desktop, there should be plenty of opportunity for Linux PCs in enterprise nets in the future.

I have already discussed with Houston Credit Risk Management & Research  the possibility of allocation of risk protection on a name basis; at this  point in time there has been no resolution in finding an appropriate way to  allocate protection by name.  Summary of insurance: Enron absorbs the first $10mm of losses in any one year capped at the  aggregate of $30mm over a ten year period. AEGIS absorbs the next $35mm of losses for the same ten year period.

Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the  list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package.

If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours  and are, presumably, CES Retail.

Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES  Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals  stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate  or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for  CES?  This could be a can of worms.   Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production  deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?  Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.  Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the  official word.  Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate  delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to  Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the  system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently  the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The  pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to  the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be  increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany  has been creating.  However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot  of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these  were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that  CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like  this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy  from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.   Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right  now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little  confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the  pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.    Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's  pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would  have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Can you check to see  if there were any additional files sent to us at any point showing this deal  at a price of $3.465 through March ???   Otherwise, this may be another small  true up item.  As a side note, John Singer sent a list of various ""behind the citygate""  deals--I took his list and tried to match them with what CES sent to  us--there were quite a few discrepancies on prices, etc.  I'll bring this  list to you later so that you can try to match them up with your lists of  deals.

2022-04-09 07:40:08+00:00,true,4,"  Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday  morning and returning to Houston on Friday.  The purpose of my visit is in  regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick  Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will  provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during  the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has  hired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the  details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will  also map out an Enron trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan,  which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a  strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with  Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael  in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as  possible.    Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his   business controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we  would commit to for 2000.  I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good  ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron  locations with trading operations.  My earlier trips to London this year were  focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on  leveraging worldwide operations experience.  I value input from other trading  operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be  generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.    I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as  she moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but  I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.   It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in  Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading  operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.   I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and  offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role  over Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as  needed.    I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to  discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your  business efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.    This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are  conducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have  taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be  a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.   The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of  North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a  large ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort  in London will occur in mid April.    Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to  Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those  drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business  managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley  suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final  copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and  Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip  in London with regard to support for SIngapore.  The Houston team returned  the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.  I  can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was  pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was  out of the office last week).  We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney  and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to  accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.

While the date of my request is later than I would have wished, the reason is that I had originally planned to go back to Turkey this summer and get my mandatory military duty done. However, I now realize I can put it off to a further date. That left me wondering if you believe there is a project that I can get involved in this summer and be useful. If that were the case, I would be more than happy to postpone my military duty and spend the summer with the research group. I discussed this with Dr. Ronn, and he is very supportive of this idea.  I apologize again for bringing up this issue late, and look forward to hearing from you.

I  have also been receiving on average 2 or 3 of these requests per day and I  usually don't even begin looking at these until 6 in the evening.  Some are  quick fixes, but the majority lately have not been.  Todays calendar isn't  looking much better.  I contacted Wade on this last week, but have not received anything.  I hate  to hold you back from making your payments, which is why we have spent  another good chunk of time justifying a new position under Carrie Hollomon to  handle these types of requests.  That position is now to be filled by Teri  Franklin.  I'm sure that she is not totally up to speed on everything such as  sitara, so please continue to be patient for awhile.    So that this whole process might be sped up a little faster, I would like to  suggest that you obtain the pricing information from either Lashonda or Wade  and then pass the information that you need set up in it's entirety to Teri.   If the information is provided in it's entirety this will keep us from  setting up deals with incorrect pricing.  Which then causes us to have to go  back and do further rework when either Wade of Lashonda informs us of the  error, which is exactly what I received an email on earlier this morning.

For the 11 month synthetic storage deal proposed by the Peoples Energy , the model gives $0.51/mmBtu.    Thus the People's bid for   $0.49/mmBtu is in line with the model.  I would be happy to discuss the details for everyone who is interested.   In  essence, the model allows optimal  injections during March-May and optimal withdraws dring Dec-Jan.

John        Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.    From:  Sally Beck                           14/03/2000 15:58    To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: Trip to London Next Week   Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday  morning and returning to Houston on Friday.  The purpose of my visit is in  regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick  Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will  provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during  the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has  hired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the  details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will  also map out an Enron trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan,  which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a  strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with  Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael  in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as  possible.    Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his   business controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we  would commit to for 2000.  I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good  ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron  locations with trading operations.  My earlier trips to London this year were  focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on  leveraging worldwide operations experience.  I value input from other trading  operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be  generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.    I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as  she moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but  I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.   It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in  Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading  operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.   I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and  offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role  over Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as  needed.    I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to  discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your  business efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.    This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are  conducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have  taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be  a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.   The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of  North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a  large ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort  in London will occur in mid April.    Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to  Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those  drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business  managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley  suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final  copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and  Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip  in London with regard to support for SIngapore.  The Houston team returned  the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.  I  can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was  pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was  out of the office last week).  We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney  and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to  accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.  They  understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them.       ",Sally Thanks for the note.

Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES  Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals  stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate  or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for  CES?  This could be a can of worms.   Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production  deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?  Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.  Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the  official word.  Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate  delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to  Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the  system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently  the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The  pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to  the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be  increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany  has been creating.  However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot  of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these  were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that  CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like  this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy  from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.   Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right  now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little  confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the  pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

It is broken out in what was delivered in dth and  what was delivered in mcf.    I have also added a column to show the  difference between what was delivered in dth vs mcf.     We had numerous problems with nominations on Michcon's system for the dates  of 3/2 thru 3/7, however Tom Butzon with Michcon worked very hard to make  sure that all of our markets were kept whole.   After reviewing deliveries to  CES per Michcon's system this is the breakout per day:     Per CES Request  Per Michcon  Difference 3/1/00   11,417    11,417   0 3/2/00   11,417    11,240   (177) 3/3/00   11,417    11,417   0 3/4/00   11,417    11,417   0 3/5/00   11,417    11,417   0 3/6/00   11,417    11,417   0 3/7/00   11,417    11,417   0 3/8/00   11,417    11,417   0 3/9/00   11,450    11,450   0   I spoke with Tom this afternoon regarding the cut on 3/2/00 and he cannot go  back and reallocate that point.    Regarding the increase for 3/8/00 it is  imperative that Donna calls us to let us know that she sent an email due to  the fact that we do not always have time to check email in time to get the  gas put in the position for the next day.  Also in the event that someone is  out and that person cannot check their email, a simple telephone call to the  scheduler would help tremendously.    Reqarding Doug's letter dated 3/7/00 regarding insufficient volumes at  acceptable points for the Michcon Select Program, it is my understanding that  a volume of 7,300 mcf is the requirement CES has to the Select Program.  On  the attached spreadsheet I have broken out the points Enron delivered gas to  CES on the acceptable points and we have met those requirements every day  with the exception of 3/8 and 3/9 where Enron shorted CES volumes at required  Map #'s by 272 mcf.  This was due to late changes we received by our  suppliers.   If CES did incur penalties on 3/1 thru 3/7 then CES needs to  look at how they are allocating each point since certain points are to be  delivered to the Select Program first.   When CES receives all their points  for the day they should first allocate the SELECT points to their SELECT  customers, the remaining points  can then be divided up between their other  non specific customers.   I apologize for the confusion but I believe we have  made a valiant effort to keep CES whole at the proper points as best we  could.

I will be very brief, so please inquire  if you want to know more.  Also, please forward to anyone I may have left off  this distribution.  I can't remember everyone who attended the various  meetings last week.  Reporting Live Users - A number of workshops have been conducted and are scheduled to  be conducted to help users better understand how to get at information in  SAP.  APACHI and South America users have had workshops; CALME and EECC are  scheduled, and NEPCO/OEC are being planned.  Please contact me, Greg Nikkel  or Kim Lesley to find out more on status.  Also, any feedback you have for me  on the effectiveness of these workshops and suggested next steps will be  welcomed. 4/1 and 7/1 Go Lives - Susan Bellinghausen and Emitra Nelson and the  respective representatives from the Business Units are working to make the  next to go lives smoother with respect to reporting.  Again, any feedback you  could pass on to me, Kathy Kokas, or Susan regarding suggestions or concerns  is appreciated. Long Term Reporting Strategy - We are still looking to identify a lead person  to head up the long term reporting strategy.  This would involve  understanding any true reporting gaps, as well as the right processes and  tools for closing these gaps.  In addition, the right degree of ""common"" and  business unit specific reporting needs to be defined, and the degree to which  reporting solutions are function-specific or cross functional (e.g.,  financial, HR, procurement, projects).  Close/Consolidations Bob Butts and Jan Johnson have taken point to head up a group to review the  consolidation and close process to determine how/when we get the process  optimized.  Susan Bellinghausen has followed up with Bob to schedule the  requested demos of ECCS vs Hyperion functionality.  F/X I was requested to obtain resources to do a third party review of the overall  effectiveness of our foreign exchange transactions as they flow through  different modules.  I am meeting with Kimberley Scardino of Arthur Andersen  this week to outline the assignement, and have obtained a commitment from SAP  America to bring appropriate SAP expertise to the review.  We expect to  complete this review in approximately 3 weeks.  The outcome would be a report  on whether effective processes and controls are in place for f/x processing,  and suggestions for how we could more effectively use SAP's capabilities in  this area.  Customers - please let me know how we're doing.  Thanks!","This purpose of this message is to update a variety of interested parties on the status of several ""hot"" topics.

2022-04-09 12:44:41+00:00,true,4,"  Per my voicemail message to John.  I talked to Stacy Miller at TCO to better understand the SIT limitations.  TCO has something called TFE (Total Firm ???). Plants can burn up to this  amount and plus 1.03%.  Allied has the following FTS capacity;  39095 50075 62672 3333  Total 53408  x 1.03  Total allowed without penalty 55,010  Stacy, Cindy, Steve please verify this amount.  If Allied burns above this amount then they will be subject to penatly, even  if SIT withdrawal is allowed. TCO has started to enforce this penatly again.  Stacy did say that we could true-up the next day to avoid the penatly, like  we do for the Cogen's. However, you still need capacity above 55,010 to meet  the burns. That is why Cindy was letting Allied use its SIT withdrawal and  Aristech's contract. Unfortunately, this was cut by TCO by about 50%.  Not sure what you want to do John. You are welcome to talk to Chris and Scott  about using Enron's Capacity... but ours is maxed out for the Cogen's in that  area. International Paper may have some idle capacity, you would have to talk  to Amy at Alliance 502-426-4500 x7372.  This brings up another question. When will Allied be transferred to another  fuel manager?? Lee Tippet said it would be effective April 1st. If it is not  April 1st, Allied needs to sign the piece of paper to allow Enron access to  perform Allied's nominations. If Allied still refuses this to do it, you will  need someone at CES to perform these nominations. I will not have access to  my CES account on April 1st to do Allied's nominations.

2022-04-09 07:38:53+00:00,true,4,"  In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the  Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the  deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John  Singer).  Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the  list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package.  I'm assuming  that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the  TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point,  which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the  Wholesale package.  If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours  and are, presumably, CES Retail.  If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then  we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to  handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to  Enron.    In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it  from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or  not.  Thanks.

Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES  Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals  stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate  or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for  CES?  This could be a can of worms.   Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production  deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?  Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.  Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the  official word.  Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate  delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to  Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the  system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently  the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The  pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to  the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be  increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany  has been creating.  However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot  of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these  were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that  CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like  this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy  from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.   Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right  now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little  confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the  pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.    Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's  pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would  have had to nominate it in Navigator.

However, I now realize I can put it off to a further date. That left me wondering if you believe there is a project that I can get involved in this summer and be useful. If that were the case, I would be more than happy to postpone my military duty and spend the summer with the research group. I discussed this with Dr. Ronn, and he is very supportive of this idea.

2022-04-09 01:10:27+00:00,true,4,"  At the request of the Financial Council during its last meeting, the COE  established a SWAT team to assist the business units in SAP reporting.  This  is the first of weekly status reports that we will provide.  Purpose:    The team has begun to hold small, interactive workshops with production users  to:  Show users how to extract data from SAP by: Using on-line inquiry Using SAP standard reports and Creating and modifying a variant Educate users on the SAP data model and where business unit specific data  resides in SAP (which module). Better understand what additional reporting needs users may have.  Team structure: Lead:  Kim Lesley (consultant)    PS:  Andreas Kraus (COE), Damon Willis (consultant)    FI/CO:  Randy Parman (COE), Esther Cortes (consultant)    Education support:  Maria Young (COE)  The structure of the team reflects the initial focus on project and financial  reports.  It has been balanced to include COE support analysts who will  provide long-term customer support plus SAP consultants with deep reporting  knowledge.  We will adjust the team members as appropriate to address the  material needed by the business units.  In addition to this team, Susan Bellinghausen and Emitra Nelson are  continuing their efforts on 1/1, 4/1 and 7/1 report development.  Progress:  To date we have held 5 workshops with the Apachi and South American regions.   These workshops have been evaluated across several criteria.    On a scale of 1-4 (1 = not at all and 4 = absolutely), the workshops have  received an average rating of 3.6 in learning reports and increasing comfort  levels.  The workshops are definitely providing the one on one experience  that the users are requesting.  They are also seeing and learning (hands on)  various tools that are available to them to adjust the display of reports,  query the data from each module and analyze the data.  The sessions are also  helping to remove some of the fear associated with trying things in a new  system by providing helpful tricks and hints from the experts.    However, there is still a concern about increasing the understanding of where  data resides within SAP.  This is reflected in the average rating to the key  question ""can SAP meet your needs"" being only 2.5.  We will further explore  why the users think this is the case and what they are not getting.   We are  adjusting our sessions to address this and will continue to seek feedback.    Upcoming key activities:  Schedule the remaining International region sessions and the EECC home office  sessions.  We have the participant lists and are working on logistics. Complete the analysis of the needs of the other business units in production. Develop a process to follow up on these sessions to monitor the learning  progress of the users. Begin to evaluate a cost center reporting tool that Enron Europe has deployed  in London.   I would like to thank the active participation of the business units in  identifying and providing the right group of resources to the sessions.  If  you have any questions or comments, feel free to address them to Melissa  Becker, Kim Lesley or myself.

Issues:  Housing - They will each be bringing their families with them (Brent - spouse  and 2 small children - the baby will need a crib; Sally - husband and 3  children - ages 15, 11 and 2).  I understand that the houses which have been  vacated due to returning expats have all been filled, so can you have someone  arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them?  Immigration - Due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and  have made trips already, I feel it would be best to apply for work permits  versus using the visa waiver.  I have sent them the forms and requested that  Brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his  sometime shortly after he arrives in the UK.  I have informed him that he  should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by April  1.  Tax - Please confirm whether PAYE will need to be paid for them during the  short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit.  Benefits - I have suggested that they remain on US domestic payroll and  benefits and, if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent  in the US, they may claim the excess on the expense report.  Per diem - We need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size.  Let me know of any other issues we need to address.  As always, I appreciate  your help.  Jane   ","I am really sorry for this, but I must now run home and I am off tomorrow. I will respond to this message on Friday at 11 am London time. Brent - please can you forward work permit application to Lisa Mcrae, my assistant, who will get the work permit rolling. Thanks. Tar"

2022-04-09 03:34:10+00:00,false,4,"  Just wanted to let you know a few updates:  1) We have a full IT team now ready to go.  We are going to prototype the  first window, Market Penetration.  The prototype will give us something with  sample data to show various traders to get additional feedback on  functionality.   Hopefully, we will have something in 2 weeks.  2) The previous cost estimates still stand until we have more feedback from  the prototype.  The estimates are $1.6M for phase I and $1.6M for remaining  phases.  3) Included in the cost estimate is a figure of $ 389K for the purchase of  customer prospect data from Dun & Bradstreet.  The $389K is an O&M expense  amount that was not included in the 2000 budget.  This amount combined with  other amounts ENA did budget for or will spend with D&B results in an overall  budget impact over the next 12 months of $278K.  I spoke with George Wasaff in Strategic Sourcing this morning at the request  of Philippe Bibi.  George has some ideas for negotiating a better deal from  D&B.  Either he will get more customer records for the price or negotiate  better terms for a longer term on the recurring contract with D&B.  This  could take some time and push us late on getting the data scrubbed and ready  to go for implementation.  I believe I can give George some time to try  something, but when it comes down to it, $389K isn't that much money.   Therefore, I suggest that if we don't have anything negotiated in the next  three weeks, we sign the current proposal from D&B and move forward.    D&B  is currently threatening (a negotiation tactic, I think) to pull their  development resources off of this project until they receive a signed  agreement.  In the event this comes to pass and adversely impacts our  delivery of Global Entelligence, we can provide a letter of intent to keep  them moving or sign the proposal at that time.  Give me a call at 3-6079 if you have any comments on any of the above items.   ","Just wanted to let you know a few updates: 1) We have a full IT team now ready to go.

I also spoke  with Barry, and he's excited as well.  I think it's a done deal.   Scott/Michael - I told Barry one of you would contact him tomorrow to discuss  the next steps re: a more standard expat package (not the 6 month situation -  Causey approved a more standard longer term expat arrangement), and plans to  move his family to Tokyo.  The issue we need to work out is transition, and I asked Barry to discuss  that with you directly, Joe, and I told Fernley we'd obviously be flexible  but we'd like him sooner rather than later.  Barry indicated the guy that  Fernley just hired that Barry was going to be reporting to is going to start  towards the end of April.  So I bet they're going to want some overlap there,  which puts us into end of May before Barry could really move.  I think we  should be able to accomodate this somewhat longer transition period with  Heidi's help and with Carol from Houston if necessary, plus I told Barry we'd  want him to make at least a couple of trips over to Tokyo in the interim so  he can start getting involved even before he moves over there.  But it will  be important for us to understand what specifically you want Accounting to  accomplish by the end of May so Heidi and Carol can plan how to support those  efforts while not infringing on Heidi's responsibilities and demands in  Sydney.  Meanwhile, I've asked HR to contact Eugenio Perez, Sally's designee for the  temporary Risk position, to begin those discussions, and Sally said she could  address transition issues for him next week - she'll be in London  (Scott/Michael - you should probably give her a call in the London office  their Monday afternoon).

2022-04-09 05:19:51+00:00,true,4,"  All  I have received a few notes about this since this one but I will try to  respond to all questions here. Please see below responses in RED:          Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.    From:  Jane Allen                           08/03/2000 17:54    To: Tara Rozen/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brent A Price/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kim  Melodick/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Transitional Assignments      Please note this is confidential at this point!  To document what we discussed by phone, I met with Sally Beck and Brent Price  today.  Fernley Dyson has a vacancy that he is attempting to fill, but it may  be 3 to 6 months before the position is up and running.  To accomplish the  need in the meantime, Sally and Brent have agreed to share the duties as  follows:  Brent - April 1 to June 15 Sally - June 16 to August 15  They are traveling to the UK the week of 3/20 and would like to schedule some  time with you on either Monday afternoon or Wednesday.  Please let us know  what is good for you.  I have free time on the morning of the 20th. I will book out a room from  11-12am in HR. Please let me know if this is a problem.  Issues:  Housing - They will each be bringing their families with them (Brent - spouse  and 2 small children - the baby will need a crib; Sally - husband and 3  children - ages 15, 11 and 2).  I understand that the houses which have been  vacated due to returning expats have all been filled, so can you have someone  arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them? I think the best  way to go here is for us to use serviced apartments as it will be very  difficult to find a lease for such a short period for this type of  accommodation. My assistant, Lisa, has put a call in to a service who can  help us find serviced accommodation in South Kensington/Chelsea area or in  Dolphin Square where we have people now who are very satisfied. Is there a  reason you are partial to South Kensington/Chelsea? What if we find  accommodation in another nice area of London within a short commute to the  office? When I have some options, I will let you know, probably on Monday.  Immigration - Due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and  have made trips already, I feel it would be best to apply for work permits  versus using the visa waiver.  I have sent them the forms and requested that  Brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his  sometime shortly after he arrives in the UK.  I have informed him that he  should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by April  1. Brent's work permit will be submitted today and we may receive if before  April 1st, but it is unlikely. The way it works for this is as follows: Brent  will receive the work permit from us and if he is here, he will have to leave  the UK and enter with the work permit for it to be validated. If his family  are in Houston, they will need to receive entry clearance in the US prior to  arriving in the UK. This takes approx 7 working days and they will require  either Brent's original passport and work permit or a certified copy of each  along with other things such as marriage and birth certificates. If Brent  decides to bring his family with him to London prior to receiving the work  permit, they must say they are coming on a vacation for a short period of  time and have a return ticket to back it up. Once the permit is received, the  family can either travel back to Houston and submit the entry clearance visas  there or they can all travel to Amsterdam where they are currenlty issuing  entry clearance without a problem. There is always a small element of risk in  going to Amsterdam, however, as do not have to issue the stamps there, they  just do it because they are nice! Work permits are arriving approx 4 weeks  from date of submission. We can discuss all of this on the 20th.  Tax - Please confirm whether PAYE will need to be paid for them during the  short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit. PAYE is  due after 60 days; however, if Brent and Sally are really only going to be  here for approx 75 days, I am not going to inform the Revenue that they are  here. If this extends beyond the set time, we can look at options but the  only responsiblility that Brent and Sally will have is to ensure they  complete the tax organiser in order for us to get the tax back. Also, as we  would have to apply the treaty here, we need to ensure the salary costs stay  in Houston. Jane, have you discussed this point?   Benefits - I have suggested that they remain on US domestic payroll and  benefits and, if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent  in the US, they may claim the excess on the expense report. Agreed.  Per diem - We need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size.  Jane, please call me to discuss. I have left you a message, thanks  Let me know of any other issues we need to address.  As always, I appreciate  your help.

2022-04-09 07:41:18+00:00,true,4,"  Steve, I talked to Cindy Burnette about SIT Penalties in February on Monday,  3/13/2000. Unfortunately Joann and I thought the SIT withdrawal Penalty was  lifted on 2/3/2000 and reinstated on 2/17/2000. We did not realize that TCO  lifted the penalty for only one day on 2/3/2000 and reinstated it on  2/4/2000. TCO lifted it again on 2/15/2000 and reinstated it on 2/17/2000.  Joann and I missed the period from 2/4/2000 to 2/14/2000.  In early February, Cindy talked to Joann and I about matching the burns to  the best reading around noon of the gas day that just ended. Because TCO  allows it shippers to  use SIT, our goal is try to match the burn to about  500 dkt difference. There are some days we will go a little longer and some  days we will go a little shorter. Our February 2000 monthly goal was to hit  close to zero. I'm attaching a spreadsheet that shows Enron's net SIT for  February was +288. Joann and I also realize that when SIT withdrawal is not  allowed, that we need to send extra gas to the burn and then back off the gas  once the actuals are received.   The attached spreadsheet shows that on days 2/4/2000 to 2/6/2000 that Enron  had 17,753 Broadrun gas going into Enron's IPP pool. Each day the SIT  withdrawal was less than 500 dkt. On day 2/9/2000, we did adjust the actuals  to meet the burn and Joann sent the print screens to Cindy on 3/10/2000 for  proof to waive the penalties. On gas days 2/11/2000 to 2/14/2000, we were  short less than 500 dkt and we had 5684 broadrun gas going to the pool. On  2/18, we did adjust the actuals to meet the burn and sent the screen prints  to Judy on 3/6/2000 for proof to waive the penalties for that day.  Joann and I are very competent and experienced schedulers and were not trying  to game TCO's system by abusing the SIT withdrawals. We just didn't realize  that TCO had reinstated the penalties for SIT withdrawal for 2/4/2000 to  2/14/2000. The way TCO posts on the bulletin board, it is not always clear to  the shippers when penalties situations are lifted and reinstated.  My other concern was how this penalty was communicated to us. Julie called me  on 3/6/2000, and said that Judy wanted Julie to send to me the 8 series  report. I told Julie I had no idea what she was talking about, but go ahead  and send the report. When I received the report, it was the report we had  used for overrun charges. We did not occur overrun changes, so I was not  concerned with the report. Then Cindy called me about an hour later on  3/6/2000 to tell me we had Hopewell penalties. I told Cindy I didn't  understand what penalties we had incurred, since there were no overrun  charges. She said we had SIT withdrawal penalties. Joann and I looked at days  1, 2, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We faxed over the proof to TCO for day 18, that  we had matched the burns to the readings available at noon that day. Joann  specifically asked Judy if this was the only penalty we had, and Judy was not  100 % sure but thought so.   There were no further conversations between TCO Team 3 and Enron about the  SIT withdrawal penalties, until Cindy called Joann on 3/10 around 4:30 pm to  tell Joann we had incurred several days of penalties. Joann asked Cindy which  days, since we had already fixed the days we knew about SIT withdrawal  penalties. Cindy told Joann about days 4,5,6,9,11,12,13, and 14. Joann faxed  the proof for day 2/9/2000. Joann asked Cindy if she could do the retro's for  the other days because we had plenty of Broadrun gas going to our pool. Cindy  told Joann that she would have to run it past Steve, to waive the other days  penalties.  TCO's philosophy has been vary accommodating to its shippers in the past.  Judy had always told Joann and I, if CES/Enron made a good faith effort to  keep SIT to a minimum, the penalties will not be charged. Enron feels it made  a good faith effort to minimize SIT withdrawals in February 2000, and would  like the SIT withdrawal penalties to be waived.  In addition, Enron has a win/win request for our Customer ServiceTeam. TCO's  penalty philosophy appears to be changing and will not be as accommodating as  it was in the past. Enron would like our Customer Service Team's assistance  during the month to identify potential penalty situations. This will  alleviate disagreements between TCO and Enron at the end of the month.  Before I send the this to Jeanne Adkins and Tom Brasselle, I'm running this  past y'all.   Thanks for your assistance and understanding Enron's point of view.

2022-04-09 07:08:05+00:00,true,4,"  Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate  production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES  Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals  stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate  or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for  CES?  This could be a can of worms.   Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production  deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?  Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.  Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the  official word.  Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate  delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to  Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the  system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently  the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The  pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to  the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be  increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany  has been creating.  However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot  of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these  were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that  CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like  this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy  from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.   Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right  now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little  confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the  pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.    Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's  pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would  have had to nominate it in Navigator.

2022-04-09 09:11:28+00:00,true,4,"  Sally and Ted,  Brenda, Vlady and I met today to discuss Project Door Step for Mariner.   Since Mariner is an E&P company rather than a trading company (or so we  think), I believe our approach may be somewhat different from the other  trading reviews.  The review will likely focus on the company's risk  management policies and procedures which we  think relates mostly to hedging  oil and gas production.  Based on a review of the last Mariner 10-Q (Sept  99), it appears the company does a significant amount of hedging with  financial instruments extending out to 2002.  The company also has  significant ($14MM) of deferred losses related to hedging activities.  As discussed with Ted, we have preliminary planned to visit Mariner on Tues.  March 21.  As a starting point,  Vlady is pulling RAROC information related  to Mariner and Brenda is getting all Enron positions with Mariner.  Please  call if you have any questions.

2022-04-09 00:25:11+00:00,false,4,"  Team,  We need to push forward on the next phase of the pricing model.  I sense that  we have lost some momentum so we need to pick it back up.  Enron needs to shed some of the risk of this deal in order to be able to do  more of them.  I think the insurance market is a great platform to accomplish  this.  I think our success potential is high as long as Enron is in a first  loss position and pro-rata loss for the balance.  However, I am not confident  that the insurance industry will be able to work up a meaningful offer.  My  solution is to calculate a bid for their services.  The loss I am trying to protect is associated with a bankruptcy process where  Enron seeks to gain control of the underlying asset and/or its liquidation.   I propose that the trigger for an insurance pay-out would be the sale of the  underlying project to a third party in a liquidation scenario for the benefit  of creditors (i.e. EPMI).  I would like to price a structure where EPMI takes the first $50/kw of Loss  and 10% of the balance.  Loss will be defined as Par amount of debt  outstanding plus Net Amounts owed EPMI less sale proceeds from plant.  Net  Amounts owed EPMI will include the net amount of MTM and accrued index  payments owed EPMI under both the Financial Buy and Financial Sell contracts  as of the date of sale.  For purposes of this analysis lets assume initially  that Net Amounts are $0.  One way to price this product would be as a put option of 90% (100% - 10%) of  the MW of the plant at a price equal to par amount of debt less $50/kw.  I am  open to other ideas.  I expect results to be presented in the form of reduction of the put premium  ( equity's option to put plant to EPMI) that we have been calculating to date.  It is also essential that we update the pricing models to reflect different  start and end dates and different strike price calls for each year.  regards,  Don 3-4750","Team, we need to push forward on the next phase of the pricing model.

I understand that the houses which have been  vacated due to returning expats have all been filled, so can you have someone  arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them?

Tax - Please confirm whether PAYE will need to be paid for them during the  short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit.  Benefits - I have suggested that they remain on US domestic payroll and  benefits and, if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent  in the US, they may claim the excess on the expense report.

This problem is becoming increasingly worse  each month because most of the prior months have un-finalized  invoices/payments which require reprocessing this data each month (draft,  reversal of last accrual and creating new accrual).   This condition goes  back to Jan. 99 for Unify, Jan. 95 for pre-Unify PMAs, and becomes worse each  month as more such items are accumulated.   A few month ago, we discussed this situation and as shown below, not much  progress has been made in finalizing prior month data in Gas business while  better  progress has been achieved in Power settlement.  It is essential this  be strongly addressed.  Otherwise, the system will soon be unable to process  the Monthly Closing (mass draft & Closing) within a day.

2022-04-09 13:24:15+00:00,true,5,"  I am sending via fed ex a copy of the following info on Boston Gas/Colonial:  1. 11x17 map showing Tennessee routing through Colonial system 2. 8x14 map showing the various upgrades under discussion w/Boston Gas 3. recent information from Boston Gas on capacity/delivery pressure from BG.   Our understanding/expectation is that Tennessee will be increasing its line pressure to accomadate potential back hauls now that Maritimes is tied in.   The expected pressure on TGP is expected to rise over 600 psi.  This will have a  big impact on deliverability.  Colonial serves ULP by drawing from Tennessee at Tewksbury, and also has a LNG facility at that site.  In order to ensure that LNG can always be injected into their system, BG needs to regulate pressure to no more than 600psi at the city gate.  Currently the line is running from  300psi to 600psi throughout the year.  Can you confirm our assumptions?  We are looking at the various options, but clearly option 3 looks best.  We  will be sending follow up questions tomorrow on quality of service (pressure drop, ""firm"" service), throughput charges, and other clarifications.

2022-04-09 09:07:45+00:00,true,5,"  Steve, as Dana indicated in his response to your message, Louis Dreyfus is  maintaining that their transactions with Todoroff are totally legitimate and  binding upon EOTT.  Vinson & Elkins is of the opinion that before we assert  an argument to Louis Dreyfus regarding the validity of their contract, we  need to hear the tapes of Todoroff's conversations with Louis Dreyfus.  The  ""paper"" that we have (including the notes from the Louis Dreyfus contract  administrator) certainly indicates that Louis Dreyfus suspected or knew that  something was not quite right about the December 1999 transaction with  Todoroff, but it is not enough to make a very good case for challenging the  validity/enforceability of that contract.  We need more.  John DeGeeter of  Vinson & Elkins has spoken with Louis Dreyfus'  general counsel.  Louis  Dreyfus' general counsel has told John that before he will consider providing  EOTT with the tapes, he wants EOTT to set forth in writing the reason EOTT is  requesting the tapes.  Louis Dreyfus' general counsel has also indicated that  he is not sure that Louis Dreyfus taped these conversations.  Although a final decision has not been made, here's where I think we are  headed with Louis Dreyfus.  We will send their general counsel a letter next  week indicating the irregularities with this contract (e.g. the prices quoted  in the contract were far below market, and the contract administrator had  questions about Todoroff's authorization and the ""legality"" of the deal).   This proposed letter would then suggest that Louis Dreyfus provide us with  their tape recordings of the conversations with Todoroff in order that we can  immediately resolve our questions as to whether one of Louis Dreyfus'  employees knowingly assisted Todoroff in his scheme to defraud EOTT.  My  guess is that a letter of that nature will at least cause Louis Dreyfus'   lawyers to listen to the tapes.  If the tapes do contain incriminating  conversations, we might see a softening of their negotiating position.  If  the tapes do not contain anything incriminating, it would seem to be in Louis  Dreyfus' best interest to provide us with the tapes to support their position  that there was nothing irregular about the transaction.

Has there been any additional headway in this  area?  I'm on vacation and haven't heard anything on this.  Weren't we going  to send a V&E litigator to visit Dreyfus' general counsel?

We have copies of  some of their internal notes which indicate that they knew---or should have  known---that something wasn't quite right with Todoroff's situation.

Mr. Moore acknowledged receiving the investigative  materials that we submitted last week, and he indicated that his office is  commencing its review of those materials.  I emphasized to Mr. Moore the  desire of EOTT's management to have this case aggressively prosecuted.  Mr.  Moore acknowledged that the aggressive prosecution of this matter would send  a strong message to other traders who might consider dishonest acts, and he  assured me that his office would vigorously pursue this matter.  Based upon  some statements made by Mr. Moore during our discussion, it was obvious that  he recalled much of the presentation from our initial meeting.  I will call  Mr. Moore again tomorrow afternoon to get an update on the progress of this  matter.  We are also attempting to obtain from Louis Dreyfus tape recordings of  Todoroff's conversations with them regarding the series of deals that we are  describing as ""The Second Transaction.""  If Louis Dreyfus does not  voluntarily provide us with copies of those tapes (or if they assert that  tapes do not exist), the next step will be to consider filing a lawsuit or  seeking a bill of discovery in order to obtain the tapes.  Based upon some  notes we have received from a contract administrator at Louis Dreyfus, it  appears that Louis Dreyfus also suspected or knew that something was amiss  with The Second Transaction.  Assuming that Todoroff's conversations with  Louis Dreyfus were taped, the tapes should tell us whether Todoroff had a  conspirator at Louis Dreyfus who assisted him in his scheme to defraud EOTT.  If Louis Dreyfus does not voluntarily produce tape recordings of its  conversations with Todoroff, we will need some guidance from Enron as to how  aggressive we should be in attempting to obtain the tapes.

We are proud of the job we do, and are always striving  to do it better and safer.  * It is important always to understand what pipelines are and the essential  part they play in our daily lives.  * Pipelines in this country deliver safely and efficiently much of the raw  product America needs for a growing economy and its high quality of life.   Pipelines deliver 2/3 of the petroleum products we use to fill our cars with  gasoline, fill our planes with jet fuels, heat our homes with heating oil,  and produce plastics, agricultural products, and pharmaceuticals.  Pipelines  also are vital to the national defense of this country.  * The pipelines that we operate supply people and industries in this area and  are essential to the quality of life we all enjoy.  * The public should know that the first line of defense against underground  damage is preventing third-party damage, for the public can play an important  role in accident prevention.  * Excavation damage is the largest single cause, by far, of pipeline  accidents.  * The pipeline industry is leading an intense effort nationwide, and in this  area as well, to institute programs that will help prevent this kind of  damage.  Our company is an active participant in this effort.    Should reporters wish to discuss the reauthorization process, company  spokespersons can deliver the following messages in a general way, or can  refer reporters to AOPL for a more detailed discussion.  * The reauthorization process in the Congress occurs every four years and is  taking place this year.  The process is a good way to review performance and  to consider new ideas.  We believe in strong federal regulation of the  industry and its safety standards. We are always open to discussing new ideas  to improve safety.  * It is important that pipeline operations be regulated as total systems.   Our companies operate across state lines and, therefore, it is imperative  that the federal government establish a set of rules that apply uniformly in  each of the fifty states.  * States do have an important role to play.  We need states to be involved in  pipeline safety.  Over 75% of pipelines are intra-state pipelines, and state  regulatory activities and resources should be concentrated there.  * State law governs the one-call process, the process that lets an excavator  make one call to have any underground facilities marked before beginning the  job.  It is the first line of defense against underground damage.  * Maintaining pipeline integrity is our number one job.  We use a range of  tools to test pipeline integrity: cathodic protection, smart pigs,  hydrostatic testing, and visual inspection.  Each pipeline is unique, and  different integrity measures apply to different pipelines.  * The Office of Pipeline Safety understands the industry and its safety  efforts.  It is developing a rule that will require all companies to publicly  explain the methods they are using to test their pipelines. This rule will  encompass all of the testing tools and focus on how the information is  brought together to make an informed judgment about a given pipeline's  integrity.      - Media.strategy.3.15.rtf    ","In response, it's quite possible that the USA Today article will prompt some calls to EOTT about our pipelines, and I think we should have one person (at EOTT) to whom all such calls should be referred.

Mr. Moore acknowledged receiving the investigative  materials that we submitted last week, and he indicated that his office is  commencing its review of those materials.  I emphasized to Mr. Moore the  desire of EOTT's management to have this case aggressively prosecuted.  Mr.  Moore acknowledged that the aggressive prosecution of this matter would send  a strong message to other traders who might consider dishonest acts, and he  assured me that his office would vigorously pursue this matter.  Based upon  some statements made by Mr. Moore during our discussion, it was obvious that  he recalled much of the presentation from our initial meeting.  I will call  Mr. Moore again tomorrow afternoon to get an update on the progress of this  matter.  We are also attempting to obtain from Louis Dreyfus tape recordings of  Todoroff's conversations with them regarding the series of deals that we are  describing as ""The Second Transaction.""  If Louis Dreyfus does not  voluntarily provide us with copies of those tapes (or if they assert that  tapes do not exist), the next step will be to consider filing a lawsuit or  seeking a bill of discovery in order to obtain the tapes.  Based upon some  notes we have received from a contract administrator at Louis Dreyfus, it  appears that Louis Dreyfus also suspected or knew that something was amiss  with The Second Transaction.  Assuming that Todoroff's conversations with  Louis Dreyfus were taped, the tapes should tell us whether Todoroff had a  conspirator at Louis Dreyfus who assisted him in his scheme to defraud EOTT.  If Louis Dreyfus does not voluntarily produce tape recordings of its  conversations with Todoroff, we will need some guidance from Enron as to how  aggressive we should be in attempting to obtain the tapes.

2022-04-09 00:23:45+00:00,true,5,"  Christine -- Here's a brief answer to your questions.  With regard to segmentation, Order 637 is completely silent with regard to  rates to be charged for segmented capacity, so we would have considerable  leeway here.  The order is also silent with respect to the effective  restriction of segmented capacity by making discounts inapplicable to certain  alternate (or primary) points.  Hopefully TW will be able to avoid the  segmentation issue altogether by invoking the Global Settlement, as we plan  to do in our rehearing request and compliance filing.  (Our Global Settlement  argument is that we should be able to rely on tariff provisions, including  our current restriction on changing primary points, that were implemented to  mitigate the effects of turnback on TW).  On hourly service, I believe that we could put an hourly service into place  on TW without  running afoul of the Peak and Off-Peak Rates (i.e., seasonal  rates) provisions of the order.  In other words, I think the Commission would  see them as two separate kinds of service.  As for how to communicate with our customers, I believe Regulatory has  offered to have a meeting with TW customers in early April to make a  presentation on Order 637 and provide a forum for discussion.  I realize the  order becomes effective March 27; however, compliance filings are not due  until May 1, and some requirements do not even become effective until  September 1.  Before the beginning of April, the GPG pipelines will simply  not have their positions fully formed enough to make a very well-organized  presentation to persons outside the company.  The meeting is still in the  planning stages and I will fill you in on details as they are available.  In  the meantime, if your customers have questions, I'll be happy to help answer  them.

Here are a couple of items that I need  additional clarification on:  1)  Segmentation -  You summarized "" Pipelines must allow segmentation to the  extend operationally feasible and cannot hide behind current tariff  provisions ...  ""    Does this mean, for example, an Ignacio to California  contract (i.e. 40,000 Dth/d at a $.20 total path rate) could be segmented by  the shipper such that on any single day they could nom 40 MM/d from Ignacio  to El Paso Blanco as well as 40 MM/d from Blanco to California?  If they  could, would the $.20 apply to each segment such that we could bill them 80  MM/d ($.20) for the time period that they flowed on a segmented basis or  would they only pay the $.20 applied to the contract's 40 MM/d MDQ?       Another scenario would be if the shipper is allowed to flow based on this  segmented basis, but unless the discount letter providing the $.20  specifically provides for a negotiated segmented transport rate the shipper  will be billed MAX rate for some or both of the segmentated paths (?) if  these paths are not already provided as ""alternate"" receipt or delivery  paths?    2)  Peak & OFF-Peak Rates. - You summarized "" The policy does not apply to  long-term shippers with contracts for 12 or more consective months of  service.""      TW will eventually file for hourly rates, however, the parties most  interested in this service will be marketers serving a generation station, or  the generation station's own gas supply manager/purchaser.  Most likely these  contracts WILL BE of a longer term nature than month to month or even  seasonal.  I need to reconcile your summarized comment to what we will expect  from the marketplace.  Thanks for your feedback.  Since 637 is effective March 27th, I am eager to  be able to speak intelligently to my customers regarding some of these more  critical issues.  Thanks.

2022-04-09 04:12:40+00:00,true,5,"  There are a number of superb initiatives that are being developed and  implemented  throughout EOTT that will collectively profoundly change and improve our  company. I will give you periodic updates on these initiatives throughout the year.  As an example, Priscilla Norton is doing excellent work to develop more  accurate and  appropriate truck cost guides.  This tool is giving us much better knowledge  about the true cost to transport crude oil in specific areas across our systems.  As in  most  everything we do, this is a real team effort.  I have asked Priscilla to briefly describe this tool and it implementation  below: =============================================================  ""I developed the Fleet TIME Tool  because I wanted to allocate costs as  accurately as possible to the individual lease level.   In the past fleet  cost allocation was based on district averages allocated based primarily on  miles.   The TIME Tool differs from past practice because it uses actual  truck hours spent on every EOTT truck haul.  A district cost per hour is then  established based on number of truck-hours operated in each district, and  total fleet operating dollars spent in each district.  Using the hourly  district rate, the Tool calculates district cost per barrel for each ticket  based on actual truck time consumed.  The resulting data is vital information  because even though we may already know a district averages 70 cents per  barrel, we will now know which leases are $0.45 per barrel and which are  $1.10 per barrel. This improved understanding of actual cost per barrel at  the lease level paves the way for a much better understanding of lease  profitability.   With this information, Marketing  can become more  aggressive, competitive, and confident about our costs when bidding on new  barrels, and Operations Managers can more easily identify opportunities to  optimize fleet costs.    The Fleet District Managers and Marketing have been receptive to the TIME  concept  and very helpful in providing feedback.    Although the concept of  TIME as our key cost driver is still in its infancy, Marvin Mills is already  using the information to identify opportunities to reduce his costs in  Kansas.    Willie Seale and Phil Elliot  have been using TIME data to  identify Stations where EOTT could bid the barrels out at a lower cost than  EOTT's internal cost, and to identify marginal leases to be rebid or  terminated.     Bennie Orr has been using the TIME philosophy when  Ark-La-Tex  bids on new business because the Tool has convinced him that  mileage, by itself  is not a true indicator of cost.  Our biggest struggle  right now is just getting adequate timely data to meet our needs.  With the help of Patrick Scales, the TIME Tool is currently being moved to a  server platform using the new Brio software.  Eventually the Tool should  allow us to have near real-time data at our finger tips.   Future plans  include adding pipeline barrels and tariff rates to the Tool in order to be  able to see both pipeline and truck business in the same tool (essential for  analyzing customers who have both pipeline and truck barrels).  Within the  next week, we plan to roll the Server version of the TIME Tool out to at  least one outlying office to begin testing functionality and accuracy, and to  identify any performance issues.    Our goal is that the TIME Tool move EOTT to a much greater understanding of  cost/profitability at the lease level.""

Bastrop IS the toughest part of the MS150.  We will be  meeting at the large parking area which is located at the entrance of the  park where you pay $3 entry fee.  Look for my green Toyota pickup truck with  the camper top.  Meeting time is 10:00 a.m.  It takes approximately 2 1/2  hours to drive to Bastrop from Houston.  I will bring water and gatorade.   You're on your own for food.  The route is about 12 miles through the park,  but it's a very important 12 miles because the hills are such a challenge.  Please RSVP to me so I'll have enough water and gatorade for everyone.  Things to bring: Stuff to change a flat tire Water bottle (filled with your favorite beverage) Food (fruit, power bars, whatever else) Helmet Bike Yourself  Here's a map of the park.

Turn right onto Loop 150 Travel .7 miles Turn right onto TXP1 (Park Road 1A) You'll be at the entrance to the park.  Saturday - March 25  Dan Lyons' training ride series leading up to the MS150 continues this  Saturday, March 25, as described below. The terrain will range from what Dan  considers to be light hills, through moderately hilly to hilly, and the  traffic on each ride will be light to moderate.  The rides will not be sagged  (although each of the rides will have stores at various distances) and riders  should come prepared with water, food and the equipment necessary to repair  flat tires.  The goal will be to ride these rides at a pace between 14-16MPH  and to get in a little hill work before the MS150.  Although prior commitment  is not a requirement, Dan would appreciate some kind of a head count, so if  you plan on doing one or more of these rides, please email him at  dan.lyons@enron.com or leave him a voice mail at (713) 853-1648.  All rides  will leave promptly at 8:00 a.m. so be sure to arrive in time to be ready for  a wheels up departure at 8:00 a.m..  Look for Dan in his electric blue  Explorer of ancient vintage.  This ride will start from Royal Jr. High School in Pattison about three miles  north of Brookshire off of either FM 359 or FM 362.

We admit  that the liquid industry is ""under the gun"" to some degree due to the tragic  incident at Bellingham last year, and that there is some spillover to the gas side as a result. However, we think that it is in our interest and the time is right for us to get something done in this Congress and that we need to ""be for  something"" that is workable and will also pass.  So we're not for a bill at all costs,  but we are willing to work with Rich Felder and the others at OPS to get to something we can live with. The integrity rule making will only apply to  liquids in the first phase and we think we should not oppose this attempt.

2022-04-09 16:29:06+00:00,true,5,"     Telecom Companies Mtg To Discuss Bandwidth Trading  By Michael Rieke      03/23/2000   Dow Jones Energy Service   (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- A group of telecommunications companies is meeting  Thursday to open discussions  on industry standards for bandwidth trading.    Set up by CompTel, a Washington, D.C., trade association that represents the  competitive telecommunications  industry, the meeting will initiate discussion among companies that are or  probably will be active in a nascent  bandwidth trading market that could be worth billions or trillions of  dollars a year.   Bandwidth is the capacity to move data over telecommunications networks.    Russell Frisby Jr., president of CompTel, told Dow Jones Newswires that the  trade group's members asked it to  get involved in the discussion of bandwidth trading.    The fact that CompTel is involved in discussion on bandwidth trading shows  that people are taking the idea  seriously, said Steven Kamman, a telecommunications analyst with CIBC World  Markets.    ""This year bandwidth trading will move from a theory to practice,"" he said.    Before that can happen, the industry needs to set ground rules for trading,  and that will be a major topic of  discussion at the meeting.    It comes as no surprise that Enron Corp. (ENE) will be at the meeting. For  nearly a year, the company has been  promoting the idea of setting up a liquid market for trading bandwidth under  standard terms and conditions.    Tom Gros, vice president of global bandwidth trading for Enron, has two  items he thinks should be at the top of  the meeting's agenda.    The first is establishing an industry organization to set the standard terms  and conditions for trading bandwidth as  a commodity. The second is setting a North American benchmark for trading.    The bandwidth trading organization, or BTO, should consist of companies  ""with actual financial risk"" in  bandwidth trading, Gros said. That means the group would consist mainly of  major telecommunications carriers,  the bandwidth producers.    But others also have financial risk in bandwidth, he said, including some  major Wall Street players and bandwidth  consumers.    Gros said some Wall Street players have already begun trading bandwidth, but  he wouldn't identify them. A  source with a Wall Street investment bank, who didn't want to be identified,  said Gros's claim was a stretch.    Banks with trading operations are consumers, using telecommunications  bandwidth to move stock market and  commodity trading data internationally among offices, he said. But they  aren't actively trading bandwidth as they  do established commodities.    Major consumers of bandwidth would include large Internet service providers,  or ISPs. Gros said they should  also be included in the BTO.    Before bandwidth can be quickly and easily traded domestically, the market  needs a North American benchmark  that sets technical specifications, Gros said.    In domestic crude oil trading, the benchmark is West Texas Intermediate,  which must meet standards for  American Petroleum Institute specific gravity and for sulfur content.    In the bandwidth market, standards would be set for quality-of-service  issues like errored seconds, severely  errored seconds and unavailable seconds, Gros said. Those standards would  cover corruption of data  transmitted over bandwidth as well as the availability of bandwidth.    Enron has suggested that the benchmark cover the route between New York and  Los Angeles, which ranks  among the routes with the most data traffic in North America.    Agreeing on standards will be the toughest job to accomplish at the meeting,  said Ken Epps, senior vice  president for strategic marketing for Williams Communications Group (WCG),  which will also be represented at  the meeting.    The technical standards for bandwidth trading can't be set so high that they  limit the number of companies that  will trade, Epps said. If the standards limit liquidity, the market won't  develop.    ""Everybody needs to walk away feeling that it's a standard they can live  with, that they can build their business  around,"" Epps said.    That goal can be met - it's just a question of how long it will take, he  said. ""I don't expect it will be settled at the  first meeting of the CompTel group, but it will be the kickoff.""    Williams plans to keep those discussion going next month at its own ""carrier  forum"" to discuss bandwidth trading  standards, Epps said.    About a year ago, when Enron first proposed trading bandwidth as a  commodity, Williams officials were quoted  as being skeptical about the idea.    But last month, the company announced it would take a leading role in  developing a market for trading  bandwidth. The Williams carrier meeting shows that the company is now  serious about bandwidth trading.    Williams is inviting ""the real players, the MCI WorldComs (WCOM), the Qwests  (Q), the AT&Ts (T),"" Epps  said. ""It's about people who have the assets and how we use these to  advantage the marketplace, how we build  a good powerful market model.""    CompTel's Frisby, Enron's Gros and Williams's Epps wouldn't discuss which  other companies were attending the  meeting in Washington. But Dow Jones Newswires was able to obtain a list of  attendees.    Among the invitees are companies with experience trading energy commodities  - Dynegy Inc. (DYN); El Paso  Energy Corp. (EPG); Columbia Transmission Communications, a unit of Columbia  Energy Group (CG); and  Koch Industries, which has investments in energy and telecommunications.    A surprise on the list is MCI WorldCom. Some industry sources have said the  company opposes the idea of  bandwidth trading under standard terms and conditions.    An industry analyst, who didn't want to be identified, said MCI WorldCom's  participation in the meeting is  indicative of changing attitudes in the telecom carrier industry about  bandwidth trading.    Retail marketing groups within telecommunications carrier companies don't  like the idea of a liquid bandwidth  trading market, the analyst said.    Such a market could turn retail customers into wholesale customers. For  example, a retail customer like an ISP  could go to a liquid bandwidth market and buy at wholesale prices, he said.    Also on the attendee list are telecom carriers Teleglobe (TGO) and Global  Crossing Ltd. (GBLX); NTT  America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.;  and Progress Telecom, a unit  of the electric utility Florida Progress Corp. (FPC).    Also on the list is recent IPO Universal Access Inc. (UAXS), a company that  matches carriers that have excess  capacity with carriers that need extra capacity.    LighTrade, a start-up company setting up pooling points to allow bandwidth  trading, was also invited.    Commodity traders are represented by Sakura Dellscher, Amerex, Prebon  Yamane, AIG Telecom and the New  York Mercantile Exchange.    Two consulting companies, Andersen Consulting and PricewaterhouseCoopers,  were also invited.

2022-04-09 23:03:05+00:00,true,5,"  Chris has already answered one question--I'll try to answer another.   Here  is the way the deal works as it relates to storage and intra-day swing  volumes. CES-Retail provides us with a first of the month daily sales number and a  monthly storage number.  The estimated sales numbers are outlined for the  entire term of the deal in the exhibit--each month, during bid week they must  provide us with their final number, which must be within 10% plus or minus  the numbers on the exhibit.  Anything outside of this range is an agreed upon  price at the time it is proposed.  The monthly storage numbers are provided  on the proxy schedule--we already have those numbers for the remaining term  of the agreement--these cannot be modified without mutual agreement.  In a  given month, however, CES has 5% flexibility on their total monthly volume.  Now, for the daily volume issue.  CES provides us with its nomination by  10:00 a.m., including the amount of gas it needs from storage.  If they call  us with a change to this storage number intra-day, then we must make the  change on their behalf, including buying gas to prevent them from incurring  overrun charges.  The price of any incremental sales volumes is completely  negotiable at that time.   If ENA is using any storage capacity for its own  benefit during this type of situation, and CES' new nomination is still under  its storage MDQ, but our nomination causes us to exceed the MDQ, then we are  at risk for any overrun charges.  HOWEVER, if CES never calls with a change  and their volumes increase significantly, causing overruns (even if ENA is  using some of the storage capacity), CES is responsible for any overrun costs  or penalties.  Hopefully this all makes sense--if not, I'll be happy to have a meeting to  walk through different situations.  Anyway, from a customer service  perspective, we definitely need to advise CES-Retail each and every time as  soon as we find out their volumes have changed with no notification to us and  it causes them some incremental overrun or other charge.

Choice is having huge temperature  swings causing drastic demand changes. Also, the new Choice SST contract mdq  was reduced from 134,000 to 54,000 in April. There are several cold days that  are causing ENA to service Choice via IT ($0.05/dkt) and Contract Overruns  ($0.21/dkt). Do these charges get passed back to CES?  The TCO schedulers are trying to be proactive, by looking at Intraday Temps.  Unfortunately, we are having a hard time estimating the actual burn. The CDC  posts a forecast, one day before gas flow. CDC does not post intraday temps,  we look at the National Weather Service. CDC only posts actuals, once the gas  day is ended. Once the gas day is ended, TCO and CDC only allow adjustments  on the SST contract as a no-notice storage withdrawal adjustment. Because the  burns are increasing during the cold periods, we are overrunning the  contracts.  Just want to ensure everyone is on the same page before ENA receives TCO's  April bill, and CES receives ENA's April bill. I have not discussed this with  CES yet, wanted to ensure ENA is on the same page.  So far this month:  4/4 IT = 25,589 Overrun = 6000 4/8 IT = 22,226 Overrun = 8000 4/9 IT = 12,404 Overrun = waiting on actuals 4/10 IT = 8,200 Overrun = waiting on actuals  Accumulated Estimated Cost  IT = $3421 Overrun = $2940  There was another suggestion to use the Idle transport for Hopewell and Calp.  At this time, I strongly advise not using the swing transport. If Hopewell  and Calp come up... it is usually late intraday... and does not give us  enough time to switch the transport with the CDC's. The penalty for Choice  gas not showing up is $25/dkt and getting kicked out of the Choice program.  The CDC's do not accept retro's for Choice gas. Believe me... I have tried  several times!!!! Usually CES has enough behind the citygate pool gas to help  balance for minor differences (under 100 dkt). Also, TCO is not as friendly  as they used to be in doing retro's for Choice gas.  Thank you for your help.             ",Chris has already answered one question--I'll try to answer another. Here is the way the deal works as it relates to storage and intra-day swing volumes.

2022-04-09 20:51:20+00:00,true,5,"  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 2000 NEW CLEAN-FUEL REQUIREMENT ADDRESSES 'MTBE' CONCERNS Rule Adopted Today Applies to Eastern Third of State  A new rule adopted today by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) places limits on increases in the use of the gasoline additive MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) while still retaining the air quality benefits of cleaner burning fuels.  The requirement, which applies to gasoline sold in 95 counties comprising the eastern third of the state, prohibits the increased use of MTBE to meet a requirement that the gasoline evaporates less quickly than conventional gasoline.  The new rule also requires all parties in the gasoline distribution chain to maintain proper documentation of fuel transfers, and gasoline producers must certify in annual reports that the use of MTBE in their gasoline has not been increased to meet the low evaporative requirements.  The MTBE provisions in the new rule address concerns about how this additive, which is highly water soluble, can adversely affect water quality if spilled into a stream or groundwater.  While the TNRCC estimates that drinking water containing levels as high as 240 parts per billion (ppb) of MTBE over a lifetime would have no adverse health effects, concentrations as low as 15 ppb can cause significant odor and taste problems in drinking water.","The new rule, which is in effect now, sets forth guidelines for identifying ingredients that can reduce odor and improve the health status of gasoline, as well as addressing the use of other additives and their effect on the environment."

Choice is having huge temperature  swings causing drastic demand changes. Also, the new Choice SST contract mdq  was reduced from 134,000 to 54,000 in April. There are several cold days that  are causing ENA to service Choice via IT ($0.05/dkt) and Contract Overruns  ($0.21/dkt). Do these charges get passed back to CES?  The TCO schedulers are trying to be proactive, by looking at Intraday Temps.  Unfortunately, we are having a hard time estimating the actual burn. The CDC  posts a forecast, one day before gas flow. CDC does not post intraday temps,  we look at the National Weather Service. CDC only posts actuals, once the gas  day is ended. Once the gas day is ended, TCO and CDC only allow adjustments  on the SST contract as a no-notice storage withdrawal adjustment. Because the  burns are increasing during the cold periods, we are overrunning the  contracts.  Just want to ensure everyone is on the same page before ENA receives TCO's  April bill, and CES receives ENA's April bill. I have not discussed this with  CES yet, wanted to ensure ENA is on the same page.  So far this month:  4/4 IT = 25,589 Overrun = 6000 4/8 IT = 22,226 Overrun = 8000 4/9 IT = 12,404 Overrun = waiting on actuals 4/10 IT = 8,200 Overrun = waiting on actuals  Accumulated Estimated Cost  IT = $3421 Overrun = $2940  There was another suggestion to use the Idle transport for Hopewell and Calp.  At this time, I strongly advise not using the swing transport. If Hopewell  and Calp come up... it is usually late intraday... and does not give us  enough time to switch the transport with the CDC's. The penalty for Choice  gas not showing up is $25/dkt and getting kicked out of the Choice program.  The CDC's do not accept retro's for Choice gas. Believe me... I have tried  several times!!!! Usually CES has enough behind the citygate pool gas to help  balance for minor differences (under 100 dkt). Also, TCO is not as friendly  as they used to be in doing retro's for Choice gas.

2022-04-09 18:54:39+00:00,true,5,"  There was an error in the distribution process in the previous memo which  caused parts of the text to be omitted .  The following is the correct  message.  The memo below is from our legal group pointing out some lessons we learned  from our restructure experiences last year.  We fully support the conclusions  stated in the memo and hope that we can learn from these experiences to  improve our approach to new transactions.    TO: Cliff Baxter DATE: March 29, 2000  FROM: Mark Haedicke   Julia Heintz Murray   Lisa Mellencamp   RE:  Lessons Learned in the Restructure Group     Establish Benchmarks.  Establish benchmarks for terms and conditions expected  in debt and security instruments to ensure standard and adequate lender  protections in the downside case.  The use of non-standard terms and  conditions negotiated into our documents has made it more difficult to act  quickly, has increased the legal time and expense involved, has affected the  liquidity of our investments in the distressed market and has opened the door  to disagreements with respect to interpretation of provisions in the  documents.  Non-standard terms and conditions give the other side room to  argue, where more standard provisions, with more standard and universal  interpretations, would not. Approval Process.  Make certain that the approval process highlights and  justifies deviations from the benchmarks, allows for an examination of the  pricing of the transaction based on any increased risk as a result of those  deviations and evaluates any increased legal risk in the downside case. Hold Firm in Negotiations.  Be tougher in our negotiations of the transaction  documents after the basic business deal is cut.  We start with a number of  provisions that get negotiated out when we could hold firm and obtain what we  need and want.  Deviations from the approved deal should go back through the  system. Evaluate for Downside Case.  Evaluate our documents carefully for the  downside case and price for what controls and options we will have.  What can  we do if things go south?  See if additional protections or leverage can be  built into the documentation.  For example, a second lien position gives  leverage in the downside case.  Also, we should look at preferred equity  positions with debt-like features. Prompt Exercise of Remedies.  Be prepared to exercise our remedies quickly  and to actually do it.  In certain instances verbal waivers have been granted  without going through any approval process.  Also, we have given waivers too  easily in some instances which has resulted in other creditors and investors  receiving more favorable treatment. Use of Directors.  Consider carefully the use of Enron employees as  directors.  In some instances having Enron employees as directors on boards  of companies in which Enron has invested as an equity owner and/or has  provided financing has hampered our ability to trade our investments and to  take certain actions that might be in our interest but not the company's  interest. Trading Contracts.  Limit the instances when we grant security interests in  our trading contracts or contractually tie up in any way our ability to  terminate our trading contracts.  If we do, evaluate carefully the language  used and have the trading experts involved.  Evaluate carefully the hedging  strategies employed by the companies in which we invest.  Reevaluate the use  of master netting agreements. Use of Proceeds.  Establish tighter use of proceeds provisions.  If we are  making a significant investment, we need to make sure that the funds are used  for the designated purposes.  Consider in some instances parceling out the  dollars as certain hurdles are met. Proforma Compliance Certificates.  Eliminate disputes about financial  covenant interpretations and calculations by having proforma compliance  certificates required as a condition to closing and having the business  people work through the calculations prior to closing, not after a dispute  has arisen. Evaluate Distressed Investments.  Evaluate all the components of our  distressed investments as a package to see what is in the best interests of  Enron as a whole and to coordinate strategies. Pricing.  Evaluate carefully the proposed pricing of a transaction.  Are we  being adequately paid for our risk?  If the deal does not conform to our  benchmarks, are we being paid for the deviations?",There was an error in the distribution process in the previous memo that caused parts of the text to be omitted.

Vinson & Elkins is of the opinion that before we assert  an argument to Louis Dreyfus regarding the validity of their contract, we  need to hear the tapes of Todoroff's conversations with Louis Dreyfus.  The  ""paper"" that we have (including the notes from the Louis Dreyfus contract  administrator) certainly indicates that Louis Dreyfus suspected or knew that  something was not quite right about the December 1999 transaction with  Todoroff, but it is not enough to make a very good case for challenging the  validity/enforceability of that contract.  We need more.  John DeGeeter of  Vinson & Elkins has spoken with Louis Dreyfus'  general counsel.  Louis  Dreyfus' general counsel has told John that before he will consider providing  EOTT with the tapes, he wants EOTT to set forth in writing the reason EOTT is  requesting the tapes.  Louis Dreyfus' general counsel has also indicated that  he is not sure that Louis Dreyfus taped these conversations.  Although a final decision has not been made, here's where I think we are  headed with Louis Dreyfus.  We will send their general counsel a letter next  week indicating the irregularities with this contract (e.g. the prices quoted  in the contract were far below market, and the contract administrator had  questions about Todoroff's authorization and the ""legality"" of the deal).   This proposed letter would then suggest that Louis Dreyfus provide us with  their tape recordings of the conversations with Todoroff in order that we can  immediately resolve our questions as to whether one of Louis Dreyfus'  employees knowingly assisted Todoroff in his scheme to defraud EOTT.  My  guess is that a letter of that nature will at least cause Louis Dreyfus'   lawyers to listen to the tapes.  If the tapes do contain incriminating  conversations, we might see a softening of their negotiating position.  If  the tapes do not contain anything incriminating, it would seem to be in Louis  Dreyfus' best interest to provide us with the tapes to support their position  that there was nothing irregular about the transaction.

One option we were considering was a ""share the  pain"" settlement with Dreyfus, whereby they would let us buy out of the  remaining position at a steep discount (to acknowledge their contributory  negligence in this matter).  Has there been any additional headway in this  area?  I'm on vacation and haven't heard anything on this.  Weren't we going  to send a V&E litigator to visit Dreyfus' general counsel? If we commence  legal proceedings against Dreyfus, things will become costly and contentious  between us. Information will come slowly and grudgingly.  We have copies of  some of their internal notes which indicate that they knew---or should have  known---that something wasn't quite right with Todoroff's situation.  Before  we start filing discovery motions, we should exhaust the possibility of  meeting with their general counsel to see if a quick ""business"" settlement  can be obtained.  Please advise.

Mr. Moore acknowledged receiving the investigative  materials that we submitted last week, and he indicated that his office is  commencing its review of those materials.  I emphasized to Mr. Moore the  desire of EOTT's management to have this case aggressively prosecuted.  Mr.  Moore acknowledged that the aggressive prosecution of this matter would send  a strong message to other traders who might consider dishonest acts, and he  assured me that his office would vigorously pursue this matter.  Based upon  some statements made by Mr. Moore during our discussion, it was obvious that  he recalled much of the presentation from our initial meeting.  I will call  Mr. Moore again tomorrow afternoon to get an update on the progress of this  matter.  We are also attempting to obtain from Louis Dreyfus tape recordings of  Todoroff's conversations with them regarding the series of deals that we are  describing as ""The Second Transaction.""  If Louis Dreyfus does not  voluntarily provide us with copies of those tapes (or if they assert that  tapes do not exist), the next step will be to consider filing a lawsuit or  seeking a bill of discovery in order to obtain the tapes.  Based upon some  notes we have received from a contract administrator at Louis Dreyfus, it  appears that Louis Dreyfus also suspected or knew that something was amiss  with The Second Transaction.  Assuming that Todoroff's conversations with  Louis Dreyfus were taped, the tapes should tell us whether Todoroff had a  conspirator at Louis Dreyfus who assisted him in his scheme to defraud EOTT.  If Louis Dreyfus does not voluntarily produce tape recordings of its  conversations with Todoroff, we will need some guidance from Enron as to how  aggressive we should be in attempting to obtain the tapes.

2022-04-09 04:06:32+00:00,true,5,"  Lorraine:  here's what we would have to show FERC, along with some of my  comments.  Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a  draft to send around to the usual suspects.    1.  Rate impact on TW customers; method by which TW would collect the costs  of the acquired capacity.     -  I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue  associated with the PNM capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to  other shippers.    - Net costs will be separately recorded.  2.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access  to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to  limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to  other pipeline services?  (I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain  the ""no tying"" part).  3.  Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?     - No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction  - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or  advantage to any affiliated entity.  4.  Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's  customers, to the detriment of PNM's customers?     - No.  PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods  in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM  shippers should be minimal.    - Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly  preferential treatment of TW.  5.  How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW's existing  open access operations?     - TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to  transport gas on the portion of PNM's line from Blanco, NM (i.e., the Blanco  Hub operated by TW) to Rio Puerco, NM, where PNM's system interconnects with  TW's mainline.  Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW's  tariff.    - The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW's FTS-1, LFT and ITS  (right?) rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on  TW's system.    - Lorraine -- we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM -- Would we be  able to acquire on an as-needed basis?  Would it be an ordinary service  agreement as provided in their tariff?  Which would come first, our deal with  PNM or with our shipper?  It might be good to come up with some examples of  likely scenarios.  6.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new  facilities?     - Yes.  Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan  Lateral.  Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of  prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.  Using the  PNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives  available to TW to expand this portion of its system.  It would enable TW to  transport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to  delivery points on the mainline of TW's system without the need for expanding  the San Juan lateral.  The acquired capacity would benefit customers by  effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW's  system, at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance.  Would enable  both TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently.

2022-04-09 13:13:51+00:00,true,5,"  Attached below is a copy of EPA's legislative principles for phasing out MTBE  use.   These principles have been criticized by Members of Congress -- even  oxygenate bill sponsor Brian Bilbray -- as being very vague and lacking any  helpful information whatsoever.   At the House Commerce Committee hearing a  few weeks ago, EPA Assistant Administrator Perciasepe was blasted for not  having submitted anything in detail that would help Congress solve the  complex RFG/MTBE issue.  These empty prinicples will not likely help EPA in  moving forward with their regulatory plans.  *******  LEGISLATIVE PRINCIPLES FOR PROTECTING DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES, PRESERVING CLEAN AIR BENEFITS, AND PROMOTING RENEWABLE FUELS  The Federal Reformulated Gasoline Program (RFG) established in the Clean Air  Act Amendments of 1990 has provided substantial reductions in the emissions  of a number of air pollutants from motor vehicles, most notably volatile  organic compounds and nitrogen oxides (precursors of ozone), carbon monoxide,  and air toxics (benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and others).  In most cases these  reductions have exceeded those required by law.  However, the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (""MTBE"") in our nation's fuel  supply has created a significant and unacceptable risk to drinking water and  ground water resources.  As a result of these concerns, last year EPA  commissioned a Blue Ribbon Panel on MTBE and Oxygenates in Gasoline (the  ""Panel"").  On July 27, 1999 the Panel issued recommendations on ways to  maintain air quality while protecting water quality from the risks associated with MTBE.  Significantly, the Panel called for a substantial reduction in  the use of MTBE as well as action by Congress to remove the current 2%  oxygenate requirement from the Clean Air Act.  EPA endorsed the Panel's  recommendations and committed to work with Congress to make targeted  amendments to the Clean Air Act.  In the months since the Panel issued its recommendations, detections of MTBE  in water supplies have grown and Congress has not yet acted to address this  issue.  It is of increasing importance to enact legislation that addresses  this problem in an environmentally sound and cost-effective way. Such  legislation should provide authority to phase out MTBE while avoiding  gasoline supply shortages and ensuring price stability.  The following legislative principles, taken together as a single package, are  designed to maintain air quality and enhance water quality protection while  preserving the significant role of renewable fuels, most importantly  ethanol.  In addition, it is the Administration's intention that the  resulting legislation provide sufficient flexibility with respect to both  time and range of technological choices so as to allow for continued adequate  supplies of gasoline at reasonable prices for consumers.  Recommendation #1: Amend the Clean Air Act to provide the authority to  significantly reduce or eliminate the use of MTBE.  The rising number of MTBE detections in ground and surface water in some  areas of the nation have increased the urgency for preventing further MTBE  contamination.  In some cases, communities have been forced to abandon their  drinking water supply.  To effectively address this growing problem, the  Administration recommends that Congress amend the Clean Air Act to provide  the authority to significantly reduce or eliminate the use of MTBE.    Recommendation #2: As MTBE use is reduced or eliminated, ensure that air  quality gains are not diminished.  The clean burning Reformulated Gasoline Program has helped bring clean air to  cities across the nation.  In many cases, Americans have enjoyed air quality  improvements that have exceeded expectations.  The Administration recommends  that as Congress significantly reduces or eliminates MTBE, it institute  measures that maintain our air quality gains.  Recommendation #3: Replace the existing oxygen requirement contained in the  Clean Air Act with a renewable fuel standard for all gasoline.  Reducing or eliminating MTBE in no way diminishes the continued need for  other oxygenates, such as ethanol, to control mobile source emissions.  In  addition, a significant role for renewable fuels is important to our nation's  energy supply (see, EO 13134 in which President Clinton sets a goal of  tripling the use of renewable bio-energy by 2010).  Thus, the Administration  recommends that Congress replace the 2% oxygenate requirement in the Clean  Air Act with a renewable fuel annual average content for all gasoline at a  level that maintains the current level of renewable fuel (1.2% of the  gasoline supply) and allows for sustained growth over the next decade.  Congressional action on these recommendations is essential if we are to  continue to achieve the clean air public health benefits of cleaner burning  gasoline while avoiding unacceptable risks to our nation's water supplies.   The Administration urges Congress to address this request for legislation as  quickly as possible. We remain committed to working with Congress to provide  a targeted legislative solution to this matter.",Attached below are a copy of EPA's legislative principles for phasing out MTBE use. These principles have been criticized by members of Congress -- including oxygenate bill sponsor Brian Bilbray -- as being very vague and lacking any useful information.

2022-04-09 05:17:05+00:00,false,5,"  The term of the FTS-1 agreement is for one day, and automatically renews from  day to day. The discount letter provides that the discount applies to the one-day term  and each consecutive one-day term (if any).  The term of the discount letter  is typically one month or 3 months.  The discount letter does not obligate TW  to provide service for more than one day, but as long as the term of the  service agreement renews, the same discount would apply.    My point is that if we are already contracting for daily firm this way, it  should not matter whether the discount is effective for one month or for 12  months.

This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily  firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for  consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the  other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a  certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able  to ""sell daily firm for a one-year period.""  In contractual terms all this  would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual),  and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I  see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in  marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month  period.)           ","The term of the FTS-1 agreement is for one day, and automatically renews from day to day. The discount letter provides that the discount applies to the one-day term and every subsequent one-day term (if any). The term of the discount letter is typically one month or 3 months. Subject:"

2022-04-09 07:17:09+00:00,true,5,"  Andy Lang thinks Nisource management may be receptive to considering some  joint participation with respect to the Reliant disposition.  Nisource has  been in the data room for an early look at Reliant's two LDC's, but  discussions broke down (possibly they had enough to worry about with  Columbia?).    Anyway, I have been thinking about an Enron/Nisource JV structure for the  Reliant deal that would seemingly accomplish a number of objectives for both  companies.  The valuations are preliminary and the structure could be  adjusted a number of ways, but at least it is food for thought.  I discussed this briefly with Brian Redmond and Tim Detmering this  afternoon.  They expressed interest in the unregulated storage (TPC/MHP) at  Egan and Moss Bluff, which by the way, is NOT officially for sale, but are  somewhat cool on the regulated storage that IS INCLUDED in the disposition.  Tim said that as a result of the Nisource/Columbia merger, he had intended to  ask Mark Metts to cycle with you and Cliff Baxter to discuss how best to  approach Nisource looking for ways to improve the ENA service contract with  Columbia.  If such a meeting were to take place, perhaps there would be a  natural opportunity to explore a JV concept.   Attached is a description of the JV for your review and comment.

MS Society will require a signed pledge sheet for any packet picked up, so be  prepared for that if someone has asked your assistance with this.  For you  rookies - if you've got a pledge sheet in production, just stop where you are  and copy it to give to MS, and then you can continue with your pledge  efforts.  If you haven't yet begun, you can fill out a blank one there, and  sign your name obligating to the minimum pledge.  Money is not due yet - just  pledges.  If you need to have your packet picked up, try to get a friend at Enron to do  it who can deliver it to you, and if that's not an option, and you can get by  the building at another time to pick up, just let us know and we'll reserve  it for you if you fax your pledge sheet ahead of time - that means before  10:00 AM on Friday.

If you're picking up a jersey for a friend, we'll ask for a pledge commitment  as well, because we like to know that everyone who rides for Enron pledges to  raise a minimum of $400.

2022-04-09 02:25:09+00:00,true,5,"  I have another meeting with Phil Clark (EDS) on Wednesday, 3/8.  According to  Steve, who will probably not be at this meeting since his name is now on the  ""official list"", these are the outstanding items:  I have offiered $5000 finders fee per person, Phil would like more.  Our  economic analysis assumed a $10k finders fee, so we are still within that  limit. EDS definitely wants the contract minimums for 2001 and 2002 increased.  I  will offer $8mm for both years, an increase of $2mm in 2001 and $3mm in  2002.  Again, I want to stress to them that they must EARN this additional  work.  I am still playing phone tag with Ken Stott on this to see what Azurix  plans for 2001 and 2002.    Our orginal plan, which was quite agressive, targeted 4/1 as the transition  date.  GIven that we are in the second week of March, I think a more  realistic timeline for transition is 5/1.  This means the employee offers  should be out no later than 4/1, with a yes/no answer back by 4/15.  Then  actual transition of the ""yes"" employees will take place effective 5/1.  I  think our initial ""yes"" response will be at 75%, but by the time 4/15 hits,  that amount will be 90-95%.  In discussions with Steve, he thinks this is a  realistic guess.  So, the next steps include: Finishing up negotiations with EDS/Phil Clark. Start developing a transition workplan/communication plan with HR (Robert  Jones and Ben Herman).  Please let me know if you have any questions.  I'll provide another update  after my meeting on Wednesday.  Thanks.   Jenny ","I have another meeting with Phil Clark (EDS) on Wednesday, 3/8.

2022-04-09 12:47:27+00:00,true,5,"  Here is a summary of my telephone conversation with Jay Hopper of KN Energy:  1.  KN has permitted its 550 MW Arkansas plant (and received its Entergy  interconnection agreement) and is out for bid on tolling agreements.  They  have two counterparties who have bid a 15 year tolling agreement --437 MW,  mid 7,000 heat rate; 5.75 KW-mo.; 113 MW duct firing, 4.75 KW-mo.; 3.00 mill  escalating variable O&M charge.  KN has also conducted construction bids.  [For our LM-6000 activities, seeing all this information would be extremely  valuable].  2.  KN has a draft air permit on its Jackson Michigan plant.  They will know  in 45 days if approved.  All other permits received. Since this project was  first in the cue when we last talked to KN, I suspect something negative has  happened to slow it down.  3.  KN has sites in Oklahoma, Dallas and Chicago (4).    4.  KN and another party have 6 7FA turbines for June '01 projects in  Illinois.  KN supposedly controls the turbines.  I asked KN if they would be  interested in doing deals in other states with these turbines.  They said  possibly.  The other counterparty would need an equity participation in the  end project.  I also told them that to the extent that they did Illinois  projects, we could be of assistance to them on reg. cap. pricing and sales  tax strategies.  5.  KN has sites in Ohio and Geary, Indiana where a coal affiliate would take  back a 30 year 100 mw PPA for both sites.  Given this contract, KN may  entertain doing a deal with a merchant component.  6.  I asked Jay how KN would be interested in ENA participating in these  projects.  KN is not interested in taking too much commodity risk.  Hence,  our proposal of doing a fixed price toll for 5 years and a floating index  price for an additional 15 years would not be of interest to them (evidently  Kinder laughed at the proposal; though in Jay's telephone message he  indicated that Kinder was interested in the structure).  If there was a floor  that covered debt service in the merchant years (along with some upside  participation for KN--Jay threw out a 20% participation), then they would be  interested in doing a deal.    7.  They would also entertain selling a 50% or 100% interest in these  projects.  8.  Jay told me that KN is looking to make a steady and predictable income  from these plants.  Thus far, his group has not made any money.  My sense is  that they are looking for money or a story (ENA name).  I would suggest  taking a pass at purchasing the Arkansas plant (to get their attention and  see their project information) in an effort to get involved in the 7FA and  ECAR projects.  If KN does have a long-term tolling agreement, then would  should be able to lay off a large portion of the financial risk associated  with the Arkansas transaction.  We could also look at applying Don's  structure to the Arkansas transaction.  Needless to say, the 7FAs slots, if  real, would allow ENA to do something strategic in Florida and Iowa. ",3.

2022-04-09 03:34:33+00:00,false,5,"  With regard to the Commission's limitations on the right of first refusal,  Order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that  are now subject to ROFR.  The Commission's rationale was that grandfathering  gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to  re-execute current contracts.  The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we  should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts.  In limiting the  right of first refusal, the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a  customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely  that its contract will be at the maximum rate.  Shippers that are not captive  and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR,  and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers  upon expiration of the contract.    In light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the  ROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts.  Such shippers  would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective  date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal  (assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an ""as amended""  basis).  Consistent with the Commission's order, it would not be unfair to  make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of  the contract.

FYI a little more background:    The Amgas relationship began as a result of TW's efforts to unbundle under  Order No. 636, whereby we assigned gas purchase contracts to Amgas.  In  addition, we had them administer certain remaining gas purchase contracts as  well as our de minimus sales function.  All Amgas does today is administer  our sales function.  We never eliminated our sales function; we just  transferred the administration of it to Amgas.    The marketing affiliate rule requires that a pipeline's sales division be  treated as a functional equivalent of a marketing affiliate.   Our standards  of conduct provide that the Vice President of Finance and Accounting is  advised of pertinent sales activities by Amgas but does not participate in  any of the day-to-day operations of Transwestern's merchant function.  As a  result, the VP is not a shared operating employee under Standard G.  FTS-2  transportation service is the unbundled no-notice transportation service the  (former and current) sales customers received under Order No.  636.   I think  we should be able to file revised standards saying that the merchant function  is even smaller than it was when we unbundled [true?] which is not enough  work for an agent to perform and that we've brought it back in house and  explain why the person with the sales function responsibility is not a shared  operating employee under G.

This sounds like a good candidate for a waiver application to FERC.  If we  can save the $60,000/yr, it would be worth asking FERC for authority to  simply use an ET&S market services person to administer the farm tap sales  from time to time, without any functional separation or other junk.  We could  even list the specific sales contracts we have so FERC would be comfortable  that we are not going to expand the business.  The NN situation was different  (I think) because NN had formally notified FERC that it was discontinuing use  of its sales rate schedule.  Would TW use the FTS-2 rate schedule?  We have  never formally discontinued the TW sales function, right?   What do you guys  think about the likelihood that FERC would approve such a waiver?

I've been asked to look into whether TW may administer its farm tap sales  contracts directly or whether we need to continue to use AmGas.  TW no longer  has any gas purchase contracts, just a handful of sales contracts to persons  who granted rights of way to TW.  Many of these parties don't even buy gas on  a regular basis, but they still have the contractual right to do so.  We pay  AmGas around $60,000/year to administer the contracts.  The AmGas contract is  terminable on 30 days notice.  I know that last year NNG re-established its pipeline sales division to make  occasional gas sales and for other economic reasons (i.e. the base gas  deal).  Do you think it would be worthwhile for TW to do the same?  Looks  like NNG had an easy time getting its filing approved, but would like to hear  from you what all was involved behind the scenes -- in other words, was it as  easy as it looked?    Another idea that Maria suggested would be to apply to the Commission to  waive the Section 284.286 requirements in this instance since the remaining  sales contracts are so few and insignificant.

2022-04-09 00:59:48+00:00,true,5,"  PM-ME--MTBE Lawsuit, Bjt,600      Associated Press       Friday, March 3, 2000       Judge rejects class-action status for MTBE lawsuit      By MICHELLE EMERY=      Associated Press Writer=       PORTLAND, Maine (AP) _ A judge has ruled not to give      class-action status to a lawsuit a handful of Maine well owners filed      against the makers of the gasoline additive MtBE.       Cumberland County Superior Court Justice Roland A. Cole ruled      Thursday that the suit should not encompass all Maine well owners. He      said there are too many different ways that MtBE, or methyl tertiary      butyl ether, can cause well contamination, such as through spills or      leaking underground tanks.       Cole ruled that the lawsuit the five homeowners filed against      the manufacturers does not adequately encompass the MtBE concerns of      all well owners.       Cole wrote in his ruling that the plaintiffs' decision to      exclude personal injury cases and claims against ``actual spillers''      could preclude class members with contaminated wells from suing for      other damages. He added that class members whose wells have lower      levels of MtBE would be barred from receiving damages to clean up      their wells.       ``I think it's a mistake, and it doesn't quite hold up under      real world facts,'' said the plaintiffs' lawyer, Jon Hinck.       ``Well owners in the state of Maine are going to have to proceed on      their own to get their well-water tested for MtBE contamination, and      pursue their own legal remedies,'' he said.       Plaintiffs sought to have the Atlantic Richfield Co., the Arco      Chemical Co. and the Lyondell Chemical Co., manufacturers of MtBE, pay      to test 250,000 wells in Maine for MtBE contamination and to      clean up any contamination found. They say the companies failed to      warn about water contamination dangers and exaggerated air-quality      benefits.       The defendants argue that state and federal environmental      officials knew about the risk MtBE posed to groundwater. They decided      the clean-air benefits of gasoline reformulated with high levels of      MtBE outweighed contamination concerns, defense lawyer William Kayatta      said.       Kayatta said testing and cleanup would cost more than $15      million.       ``The court recognized that these were at best novel and      untested claims,'' Kayatta said.       ``The court recognized that the plaintiffs were hoping to hold the      manufacturers liable for contamination of their wells regardless of      the fact that the contamination and spills were caused by others, and      we thought that was unfair,'' he said.       The defendants' next move will be to file a motion to dismiss      the lawsuit, Kayatta said.       ``We don't think there is any basis, and now that's the issue,'' he      said.       Hinck said he was encouraged by Cole's statement in his ruling that      MtBE contamination is a problem.       ``Their cases are viable, and they're going forward,'' he said,      adding that other individual well owners may join the lawsuit.       Hinck is assisting with a similar effort in North Carolina, where      well owners are trying to get class-action status for a lawsuit      against oil companies.       MtBE, a possible carcinogen, moves more quickly through soil and      water than other components of gasoline. Long-term exposure has caused      cancer in lab animals, but there is not enough data to say whether it      also will cause cancer in humans. Its use was mandated in 16 states as      a way to cut down on air pollution.       Maine stopped using reformulated gasoline with high levels of MtBE      last May, after state studies found about 15 percent of wells tested      had been contaminated with the additive. Residents in several other      states, including New Hampshire, New Jersey, California and      Connecticut, also have grown concerned about MtBE contamination.

Yvan     1_  We will value Teco as a series of hourly Spread options.=20 Legitimate points of concern:=20 a) Are we valuing an index deal or a physical deal?   b) If it is a physical deal can the plant realistically react on an hourl= y=20 basis?  Answer: The deal Enron enters into is based on an spread between PJM index= =20 and the appropriate OIL curve (New York Harbor + basis). However, the trigg= er=20 for the default of the contract (which is really what we are concerned with= )=20 is a function of the plant cash flows compared to the debt level. The plant= =20 cash flows depend on the physical operations of the plant and its capacity = to=20 dispatch during the most expensive hours of the year. Therefore the questio= n=20 of whether the plant can or cannot ramp up quickly enough to dispatch=20 economically is very pertinent to our valuation.=20 I would argue that the plant will always (or almost always) be able to=20 dispatch economically for the following 2 reasons. In the first place, its= =20 operational ramp up time is only 10 minutes. Secondly, the scalar curve we= =20 use is fairly well behaved and doesn=01,t swing around a mean position (see= =20 graph below), hence allowing sufficient preparation for the dispatchers.

2022-04-09 11:26:50+00:00,true,5,"  FYI -- This will hit the news later today or tomorrow....   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Clinton administration has decided to phase out MTBE as  a gasoline additive on grounds it poses a risk to public health or the  environment,  government sources said today.  MTBE, a leading oxygenate and octane booster, reduces emissions of smog, but  it has been linked to groundwater pollution in California and elsewhere. It  is used in one-third of the gasoline sold in the United States.  Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was  announcing this afternoon that her agency will seek to ""significantly reduce  or eliminate"" use of MTBEs under the Toxic Substance Control Act. That law allows EPA to ban chemicals  ""deemed to pose an unreasonable risk to the public or the environment,"" said  a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The agency also will ask Congress for changes in the Clean Air Act that will  encourage use of ethanol, an additive from corn, in place of MTBE, according  to a congressional source. The 1990 law requires the use of oxygenates in  gasoline.  The EPA previously has said it has no authority to regulate MTBE, and  Congress should act to limit its use in light of evidence the additive is  contaminating groundwater.  MTBE is used in all or part of 16 states, and is  in much of the gasoline sold in the Northeast. Refiners turned to the  additive after the Clean Air Act required gasoline in areas with serious air  pollution to contain at least 2 percent oxygen by weight.  Last summer, an EPA advisory panel said that while current levels of MTBE in  water pose no health risk, its use should be dramatically curtailed because  of potential widespread water pollution problems. MTBE has been found to be a carcinogen and poses health  and environmental risks, other critics of the additive have said.  The sources said the EPA action was a ""backstop measure"" because Congress had  not acted to eliminate use of MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether.  California, which has more leeway than other states to regulate air  pollution, has already decided to ban the use of MTBE by the end of 2002.  State officials have asked the EPA for a waiver from the Clean Air Act's oxygenate requirements so that the state  doesn't have to switch to ethanol, which is more expensive than MTBE.  A coalition of Northeast states said last year said that low levels of MTBE  were found in 15 percent of the drinking water tested in the Northeast, in  most cases in amounts less than 2 parts per billion. Water begins to pose a  health concern and tastes or smells bad at 30 to 70 parts per billion; about  1 percent of water supplies tested in the Northeast had concentrations above  35 parts per billion.

De facto, we will be saying that our balance sheet and  income statement reflect an ability to liquidate gas and power in North  America at the mid with no adverse effects.  While this may be true,  typically these types of institutions see the result of liquidating much more  liquid portfolios, i.e., they will not believe that we have perfect  liquidity.  I believe that we can satisfy both accounting and credit  considerations if we maintain an ability to calculate an ""orderly  liquidation"" under a negative pricing scenario (basically, multiple horizon  VAR against a liquidating position).  This is what we showed Moody's last  month.  The main difference is that the resulting number will be a hit to p&l  as opposed to having reserves against it.

2022-04-09 07:38:04+00:00,true,5,"  Last week I reported to our Board of Directors that our highest priority  objectives for 2000  are to continue to substantially improve our safety and environmental record  throughout this  year.  These objectives supersede any and all of our financial objective for  2000.  EOTT 2000 Objectives: Environmental - Reduce reportable spills and leaks by 50% Safety - Reduce lost time accidents by 30%  I am pleased to report that our Regional Business Managers, District Managers  and their  teams are working closely with Operations Governance to ensure that those  objectives are met.  Please take time to read the following article:   When pipelines are time bombs  2 million miles of them deliver potential catastrophe every day  By Patrick McMahon, USA TODAY(Front Page Article 3/14/00  BELLINGHAM, Wash. - Last summer, an underground pipeline ruptured in a city  park here and sent a torrent of gasoline along a wooded streambed toward two  10-year-olds playing with a barbecue lighter.  After the 16-inch pipeline had been hemorrhaging for an hour and 34 minutes,  an explosion sent a fireball racing through the park. A plume of smoke rose  30,000 feet.  Authorities say the blast probably was triggered by a spark from the lighter.  ""There was a spark and the sky turned orange, the boys both told me  afterward,"" says Frank King, whose son, Wade, was one of the boys in the  park. Wade and his friend, Stephen Tsiorvas, were burned over 90% of their  bodies. They died the next day.  Also killed was 18-year-old Liam Wood, who had graduated from high school  five days before. The college-bound Wood was fly-fishing in the park when he  was overcome by fumes, fell into the creek and drowned.  ""To many people, the boys were considered heroes,"" says Mark Asmundson, the  mayor of this seaside city north of Seattle. In sparking the explosion, the  boys kept the most extensive damage confined to the 241-acre park, he says.  ""The river of gasoline was heading right for the center of the city.""   On Monday, the Senate Commerce Committee held a one-day hearing here, about  five minutes from where the incident occurred, on legislation to improve  safety and government oversight of pipelines and the companies that operate  them. The hearing included gripping, sometimes tearful, testimony from the  boys' parents as well as statements from state and federal officials.  ""My baby died because of inaction. His death was preventable,"" said Katherine  Dalen, Stephen's mother.  More than 2 million miles of iron, steel and plastic pipes - some as large as  5 feet in diameter - snake beneath the earth and deliver oil, gasoline,  natural gas and potential disaster across America every day. They range from  the trans-Alaskan pipeline to tiny pipes carrying natural gas to people's  homes. Safer than gasoline trucks or ocean-going tankers by most measures,  once-remote pipelines are prompting new worries as sprawling metropolitan  areas grow into their paths.  U.S. pipeline accidents have fluctuated in the past 10 years. In the 1990s,  there were 3,917 liquid fuel spills and natural gas leaks, roughly one a day.  The incidents, most involving local lines carrying natural gas, resulted in  201 deaths, 2,826 injuries and $778 million in property damage from 1990  through 1999.  There also are environmental costs. In January, one of the nation's largest  pipeline companies, Koch Industries of Wichita, Kan., paid a $30 million  civil fine to settle Environmental Protection Agency water-pollution charges  involving 300 oil spills from 1990 to 1997. The EPA said Koch failed to  inspect its pipelines and waited for leaks before making repairs.  Liam Wood's mother, Marlene Robinson, is focused on stronger regulations  nationwide, including more and better inspections, and regional watchdog  committees.   ""I don't have any children left to protect,"" she said in an interview and  repeated at the hearing. ""This didn't have to happen to Liam, and it doesn't  have to happen to other people's children.""  Although the cause of the Bellingham incident remains under investigation,  one factor might have been damage to the pipeline from a backhoe when a water  line was being installed in 1995. But investigators also have many questions  about the role of Olympic Pipeline Co., which operates a network of pipelines  along a 299-mile corridor from north of Bellingham to Portland, Ore.  Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) want to  know whether Olympic ignored warning signs and whether it could have acted  more swiftly after the leak. But the inquiry has been delayed by a parallel  investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office. Several Olympic employees have  declined to testify and have invoked their constitutional rights against  self-incrimination.   Pipeline owners and government regulators defend the safety of transporting  two-thirds of the nation's fuels by pipeline, and they warn that more rules  could boost energy prices. Critics say pipelines are too loosely regulated,  not fully inspected and, in some cases, deteriorating.  The U.S. Transportation Department oversees pipelines. Its Office of Pipeline  Safety sets standards for design, operation, maintenance and emergency  response. Richard Felder, who heads the office, testified at Monday's  hearing. ""Our goal is to prevent incidents like Bellingham from ever  happening again,"" he said.  In an earlier interview, he defended his office's performance and the  industry: ""It's a good record. It's the safest form of transporting fuel, far  and away.""  The office has extensive rules on pipeline safety, including requirements for  signs along the route and programs to alert potential diggers, but ""there's  no such thing as risk elimination,"" Felder says. ""All you can do is manage  it.""   But the chairman of the federal government's transportation safety watchdog  agency is unimpressed with Felder's office and says it deserves a grade of F.  ""It's been the most frustrating area I've had to deal with as chairman,"" says  Jim Hall, NTSB chairman since 1994. He says no agency has a worse record of  responding to NTSB recommendations.  In a recent speech, he said there's no indication that the Office of Pipeline  Safety ""is in charge or that its regulations, its inspections, its assets,  its staffing and its spirit are adequate to the task.""   Felder takes issue with much of the criticism, but he endorses calls for more  research into pipeline safety. He said his office is in the final stages of  preparing new safety standards for heavily populated and environmentally  sensitive areas.  He emphasized that the leading cause of pipeline failure is ""third-party  damage"" from road, utility and construction work. The agency has worked to  enhance a system to alert pipeline companies of digging with one telephone  call.  Felder is critical of local authorities who ignore pipelines when making  decisions on housing and commercial development. ""Local planning has not kept  people away from pipelines,"" he says. ""It's astounding to me.""  Felder bristles at critics' suggestions that his agency is a tool of the oil  and gas industry. ""I can't agree with that one iota,"" he says. ""We try to  balance the safety issue and the economic issue.""  The Senate Commerce Committee will consider a bipartisan bill sponsored by  Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Slade Gorton, R-Wash.; Rep. Jack Metcalf,  the Republican who represents Bellingham; and Rep. Jay Inslee, a Democrat  whose district includes an operating section of the pipeline.   The bill would require periodic internal inspections of pipelines, boost  federal spending on research, increase the number of federal pipeline  inspectors nationwide - there now are 55 - and expand states' regulatory  authority. On Monday, the Office of Pipeline Safety gave the state of  Washington the temporary right to do more inspections.  The Murray-Gorton bill also would require federal certification of pipeline  workers and expand the public's right to know about spills and leaks.   ""I was totally shocked and amazed when this happened,"" Murray says. ""You  always assume that your neighborhood is safe and somebody has taken care of  this.""  The Bellingham rupture not only dumped 278,000 gallons of gasoline into this  city of 63,000 near the Canadian border but also unleashed civic furor at  Olympic Pipeline. ""It's hard for people to get interested in things they  can't see. Out of sight is out of mind,"" Mayor Asmundson says. He has visited  the boys' grieving families and lobbied Congress. The blast ""has dominated my  life since June 10.""  Pipeline operators portray accidents as isolated to escape national scrutiny,  he says. ""The whole focus of the industry is containment. Do whatever you  have to do locally, but don't stir things up nationally.""  Last week, Murray released a report she requested from the Transportation  Department's inspector general. It faults the Office of Pipeline Safety for  ignoring enhanced safety requirements, including increased inspections inside  pipes, in highly populated and environmentally sensitive areas as Congress  required in 1992 and 1996.   A U.S. General Accounting Office audit of operations is due in May. Also  pending is a decision from Felder and the pipeline safety office on whether  to restart the 39-mile section shut down since the Bellingham accident.  Olympic Pipeline has repaired the line and is eager to reopen it.  People living along the route and officials are pushing for more extensive  testing of the still-operating section of the line south of Bellingham.  Felder says he has not decided whether it should be shut down.   Last week, Felder's office ordered a new round of testing along the entire  line, but critics such as Inslee are not convinced it will be enough. The  tests must be conducted on the closed section of the pipeline before a  decision is made on reopening it.    ","Last week I reported to our Board of Directors that our highest priority objectives for 2000 are to continue to substantially improve our safety and environmental record throughout the year, superseding any and all of our financial objectives for 2000.

2022-04-09 13:13:59+00:00,true,5,"  FYI -- More information from EPA to back up its recent announcement:  Oxygenates in Gasoline  Congress required, in the Clean Air Act of 1990, that areas of the country  with the worst ozone smog problems use reformulated gasoline (RFG) with an  increased oxygen content of 2%. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia  presently use reformulated gasoline (RFG), either because of the  Congressional mandate, or because some areas have voluntarily chosen to use  RFG to help achieve their clean air goals.  Methyl tertiary-butyl ether  (MTBE) is the oxygen additive most commonly used by the petroleum industry to  satisfy the RFG mandate.  MTBE is used in approximately 87% of RFG, with  ethanol being the second most commonly used additive.  Of those areas listed  below, only Milwaukee and Chicago use RFG that is primarily ethanol.   Areas Required to Use RFG  Areas That Have Voluntarily Chosen to Use RFG  Los Angeles, CA San Diego, CA Hartford, CT New York City (NY-CT-NJ) Greater Philadelphia (PA-NJ-DE-MD) Chicago (IL-WI-IN) Baltimore, MD Houston, TX Milwaukee, WI Sacramento, CA The State of Connecticut (that portion not part of NYC) The State of Delaware (that portion not part of Phil.) The District of Columbia Kentucky portion of Cincinnati Metro Area Louisville, KY Maryland - DC suburbs and two other nearby counties The State of Massachusetts St. Louis, MO New Hampshire Portion of Greater Boston The State of New Jersey (that portion not part of NYC and Phil.) New York counties near NYC The State of Rhode Island Texas - Dallas-Fort Worth area Virginia - DC suburbs, Richmond, Norfolk-Virginia Beach-Newport News  Since the late 1970s, MTBE also has been used by the petroleum industry in  much smaller amounts as an octane enhancer to replace lead. Approximately 4.5  billion gallons of MTBE are used each year in gasoline (275,000 barrels per  day out of a total of 8.2 million barrels/day of gasoline), an increase of  more than 3 times since Congress's 1990 mandate.  MTBE in Water  Since MTBE is very soluble in water and does not ""cling"" to soil well, it has  a tendency to migrate much more quickly into water than other components of  gasoline.  Recent testing by the United States Geological Survey show  detections of MTBE in approximately 20% of the ground water in RFG areas,  while there is only a 2% detection rate in non-RFG areas.  Most of these  detections are below the levels of public health concern and are within the  range EPA has set for a taste and odor water advisory for MTBE at 20 to 40 parts  per billion.  Small individual fuel spills (more than 9 million gallons of  gasoline each year) and storm water runoff contribute to low level detections  of MTBE in water supplies.  MTBE detections at higher concentrations usually  result from leaking underground or aboveground fuel storage tanks and  pipelines.  Even though significant air quality gains have been made using  RFG, these air benefits can be maintained without using MTBE and without  endangering the nation's water resources.  MTBE - Call to Action  In response to the growing concerns regarding MTBE in water, EPA  Administrator Browner appointed an independent Blue Ribbon Panel of experts  to investigate the use of oxygen additives in gasoline.  The Panel called for  significant reduction in the use of MTBE in gasoline and recommended that  Congress and EPA take action to lift the oxygen mandate and clean up MTBE  contamination.  EPA fully supports the Panel recommendations and is taking  steps to strengthen its underground storage tank, safe drinking water,  remediation, and research programs. Upon release of the Panel's report in  September 1999, EPA immediately began working with and encouraging Congress  to pass legislation that responded to the Panel's recommendations.  To date,  legislation that would solve  this problem has not moved forward.  EPA is now  providing Congress with a framework for legislation that will give EPA the  authority to significantly reduce or eliminate MTBE.  EPA is also taking  action to control MTBE under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) as a  backup to the needed Congressional action.  A TSCA rulemaking is procedurally  burdensome and may take several years to complete.  Ethanol Use Will Expand  Current annual ethanol production is about 1.5 billion gallons.  Of this  total, about 30 percent is used in RFG during the summer in Federally  designated non-attainment areas.  About 20 percent of ethanol production is  used in the winter oxygenate program in Federally designated areas where  carbon monoxide is a problem.  The remaining 50 percent of production is used  in conventional gasoline markets around the United States to enhance octane  and extend fuel supplies.  With today's announcement by Secretary Glickman and Administrator Browner,  ethanol use is expected to continue to grow.  Provided air quality gains  achieved to date are not reduced, ethanol will continue to be used very much  as it is used today.  In areas of the country where it is heavily used,  ethanol will continue to be favored based on its price, availability and  environmental benefits.   Other areas may also find ethanol to be an economic  way to maintain air quality benefits that had been achieved with the use of  MTBE.  Without the renewable fuels standard, some petroleum-based substitutes  for ethanol may emerge over time.  The proposed renewable fuels standard  would ensure that the current market for ethanol would be maintained and  expand over time.  The renewable fuels standard will be met through the use of fuels made from a  variety of renewable feedstocks. While most ethanol now is made from corn,  other crops, such as wheat and sorghum, have and could also be used.  In  addition, new conversion technologies now in development are expected to be  available in the future for efficient conversion of cellulosic material to  ethanol.  These technologies would make possible the broader use of a wide  array of renewable feedstocks, including agricultural waste and residue, such  as corn stalks, and dedicated crops, such as switchgrass.  The President has set a goal to triple U.S. use of biobased products and  bioenergy by 2010.  The Administration's FY 2001 budget proposes an increase  of $96 million (56 percent) to support biobased products and bioenergy  research and development, demonstration and commercialization, and outreach  and education activities.  The President also directed USDA's Commodity  Credit Corporation to provide up to $100 million in FY 2000 and up to $150  million in 2001 and 2002 in incentive payments to ethanol and other bioenergy  producers to expand production of biobased fuels.  Payments will be made on a  portion of the increase in agricultural commodities purchased for expanded  bioenergy production, with smaller and cooperatively-owned facilities  receiving higher payment rates.                               ###","FYI -- More information from EPA to back up its recent announcement: Oxygenates in Gasoline Congress required, in the Clean Air Act of 1990, that areas of the country with the worst ozone smog problems use reformulated gasoline (RFG) with an increased oxygen content"

2022-04-09 13:12:22+00:00,true,5,"  EU backs MTBE despite US prohibition ENDS Daily - 22/03/00 ------------------------- The European Commission said today it had no plans to propose an EU ban on petrol additive MTBE after the US Environmental Protection Agency proposed to ""significantly reduce or eliminate"" use of the substance.  The agency says MTBE (methyl tertiary-butyl ether) is a ""possible carcinogen"" which has caused considerable damage to groundwater.  Speaking on Monday, agency head Carol Browner said the move was ""necessary to protect America's drinking water supplies.""  She said the USA would be replacing the additive with ethanol, a non-petrochemical alternative.  A spokesperson for environment commissioner Margot Wallstr""m said she was ""following the reasons why"" the US had proposed its restrictions but had ""no immediate plans"" to call for similar EU rules.  MTBE use in the US has tripled over the last decade.  It forms around 11% of ""reformulated gasoline"" - a compulsory fuel in some big cities, where it helps to reduce air emissions.  However, it leaks from pipes and storage tanks and has caught public attention because it also makes water taste foul at very low concentrations.  In Europe, MTBE is used instead as an octane booster, and typically only at concentrations of around 1.6% though it is permitted up to 15%.  New EU fuel and air quality laws aimed at eliminating benzene mean the use of MBTE is set to increase dramatically, however.  MTBE expert Eberhard Morgenroth of the Technical University of Denmark says the EU will soon face a ""political dilemma"" between protecting air quality and groundwater.  ""National environmental protection agencies are only slowly starting to realise the extent of problems connected to drinking water contamination with MTBE,"" he says.  ""It might be that in 10 years we will have the similar problems to the US.""  Denmark last month announced plans to improve petrol station storage standards after serious MBTE contamination was found at some sites (ENDS Daily 8 February).  Germany has also found contaminated sites, some formerly occupied by Soviet troops.  Neither is contemplating a ban because alternative octane boosters such as benzene are more toxic.  There are no EU environmental quality limits governing MTBE, but an EU-sponsored risk assessment is underway in Finland, Europe's heaviest per-capita consumer.  An oil industry source said a ban would ""clearly put a restriction on [fuel] blending"" and would ""not be a trivial problem,"" but said no work had been done to estimate the impact of a ban.  As one of the world's top ten high production volume chemicals, however, economic effects would very likely be significant.

Based  on my conversation with Sue White yesterday in Austin, I called her today  with the names of the three suggested award winners.  I conveyed this via  voice mail, as Sue was not in her office.  She had told me that her schedule  would be tight today, so it is likely that she and I will talk tomorrow  morning.  She wanted to be able to discuss our recommendations.  I would not  anticipate any changes as a result of my pending conversation with Sue.   However, I think that it will be best to withhold the names of the recepients  until after that conversation.

This would  put cash in Shell's pocket and rid them of a business that they feel they  paid way too much for.  It would give Intergen some needed scope, and an  immediate presence in North America.  I understand there was some sort of  ""standstill"" restricting Intergen's activities in the US that will soon  expire.  Intergen plans to escalate its US activities when the standstill  expires, and their management can't wait to get out from under the stodgy  thumbs of Shell and Bechtel.  Rene just confirmed something that I had already been hearing on the street.   I don't have a feel for the timing, and can't even handicap the odds, but  that's the story.  By the way, I am hearing that Shell plans to keep their  offshore pipe because (1) it is critical to their deepwater activities, and  (2) not necessarily an advantage for Intergen's power generation plans.

The ALJ assigned to the GIR case, Andrea  Biren, has apparently issued a ruling on SoCal's Motion to Extend the  deadline for filing the all-party settlement.   Although I personally haven't  seen the document yet, it was the primary focus of the meeting.  According to accounts from the group, Judge Biren's ruling did not grant  SoCal's motion for extension.  Rather, she will hear arguments on the motion  during the Prehearing Conference scheduled for Tuesday, April 11.  Judge  Biren also asked that parties to the proceeding be prepared to file full  scale testimony discussing all settlement proposals on file as well as offer  any addtional comments on the most promising options set forth by the  Commission.  Unfortunately, she is silent on what date the testimony would be  due (originally, testimony was due on April 17).  In addition, Judge Biren's  ruling apparently leaves open the possibility that she could be talked into  something different during Tuesday's prehearing conference (ie. a different  procedural schedule, or an amended or streamlined testimony filing protocol).  The telecon group decided to do the following: (1) approach CPUC commissioner  Bilas on Monday and let him know the status of the all-party settlement and  ask him to intervene in favor of the extension, (2) go before Judge Biren on  Tuesday (as a group, and individually, if necessary) and request that in leiu  of a full scale testimony procedure, would she accept a process whereby,  similar to what was done in the PG&E settlement, parties file declarations in  favor of one settlement versus another, and then the Judge  supervises/conducts a panel discussion on the issues surrounding the  settlement?  If Judge Biren rejects the idea of a less formal process, one  which arguably doesn't offer as complete a record in the case (which most on  the call felt was the likely outcome), then would she agree to a schedule  whereby she grants the SoCal motion, the all-party settlement is filed on  April 17, then all parties, including the Norm Pedersen group, would have the  chance to file testimony (only testimony, not additional declarations)  indicating support of one settlement over another and the reasons/logic,  including how the settlements meet the Commisision objectives, on or before  May 5?  As far as the all-party settlement document is concerned, SoCal will be  forwarding a preliminary (as yet incomplete) draft for the parties to review,  but not to comment on.

FERC was made aware of the Compression Services arrangement with ECS (at  that time via Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) in the filings for the  certification of the Kachina units.  FERC simply didn't ask any further  questions in that proceeding.  The Operation & Maintenance Agreements in  place for the Kachina units essentially accomplishes the same things as the  Operational Control Agreement in Gallup.  TW feels the O&M agreements would  be adequate to address any concerns about TW's regulatory responsibility over  the compressor facilities.  The Operational Control agreement was put into  place in Gallup because it was thought to be easier to give FERC exactly what  is was looking for rather than show them the Gallup O&M Agreement which might  unnecessarily complicate the process at that time.   2.  There is no basis in FERC Regs or the NGA for FERC to impose any type of  penalty or discontinue the Compression Service's due to TW's operation of  Kachina without the Operational Control Agreement.  No regs or law address  this situation.  Again this is tempered by the fact that FERC was made aware  of the arrangement and didn't ask any questions and the O&M agreement is in  place to accomplish control for TW.   3.

2022-04-09 12:09:02+00:00,false,6,"  The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into  discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year.  The  standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that  the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement  renews, but not beyond a specified date.  Typically TW enters into these  discount letters for a term of one month.  The marketers say that they were  once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than  a 3-month term.   I see no basis for this limitation.  The term of the FTS-1  agreement is one day, renewable from day to day.  The discount is only  applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews.  If the FTS-1 agreement  does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable.  The basis for the  shipper's transportation rights is the FTS-1 agreement.  We are not  guaranteeing a shipper ""daily"" firm for longer than a one-day term.  The  discount letter merely states that, for so long as the FTS-1 agreement  renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date. Does this make sense?  I realize you are swamped, but I need to get Steve an  answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable.  Drew and I have  discussed this and he is on board.

2022-04-09 19:22:03+00:00,false,6,"  Now that two settlement proposals and a motion to extend time have been  filed, there is no telling what the CPUC will do.  My recommendation is that  we play it safe and assume we will need to file testimony on April 17.  To  that end, it's time to review some basics.  In its July 8, 1999 decision, the Commission stated:  ""We see reason to  pursue a change in protocol for receiving gas at Hector Road, even in the  short term.  If there are burdens that would unfairly fall upon Transwestern  customers is a window was established at Hector Road, we want to hear about  it in the next phase of the proceeding.  In addition, we seek specific  proposals as to how such an arrangement should be defined.""  Accordingly, the testimony we file should explain:  1.  The unfair harm that could potentially befall TW customers if Hector Road  were established as a formal receipt point 2.   Our proposal for making Hector a formal receipt point by establishing  primary and secondary receipt points 3.  Why our proposal is fair and consistent with Commission policy (here we  might want to draw analogies to the interstate system and explain why that  works)  I will also have an opportunity to make legal and policy arguments in a brief  after testimony has been filed.  Let's discuss how best to go about drafting the testimony.  I think the best  thing to do would be to outline the testimony, then decide who is going to  say what.  I'm available after about 2:00 today.  ","Now that two settlement proposals and a motion to extend time have been filed, there is no telling what the CPUC will do. My recommendation is that we play it safe and assume we will need to file testimony on April 17. To that end, it's time to review some basic provisions of the commission."
