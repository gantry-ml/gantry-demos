Crab-Stuffed Red Snapper   List of Ingredients:   1/3 cup minced onion 3 tablespoons butter 1/2 pound backfin crab meat 1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs 1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley 1/4 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon lemon thyme 4-pound red snapper, dressed for stuffing salt and pepper 1/3 cup dry white wine mixed with 1/3 cup melted butter  Preparation Instructions:  Saute onion in butter until golden. Remove from heat and mix in the crab meat, bread crumbs, parsley, heavy cream and lemon thyme. Sprinkle cavity of fish lightly with salt and pepper. Stuff the fish and skewer edges securely. Place fish in a greased baking pan, pour wine-butter mixture over fish. Bake in 400-degree oven, uncovered for 30 minutes or just until the flesh is opaque, basting frequently with wine sauce. Serves 4 to 6.   ? If you feel in the mood to experiment, many different kinds of fish can be found at your local seafood market. There are fascinating discoveries ahead for people with some imagination and initiative.   Baked Rockfish with Potatoes   List of Ingredients:   2-3 pound rockfish, scaled, with head, tail, and innards removed  1 large onion  5 medium sized potatoes  4 thin slices salt pork or 3 tablespoons bacon grease  2 tablespoons flour  1 1/2 cups water  salt and pepper to taste   Preparation Instructions:  Peel the potatoes and cut into rounds.

Mix 2 tablespoons of flour in 1 1/2 cups of water and pour over the fish, onion, potatoes, and salt pork. Cover the baking dish, and bake at 350 degrees until the rockfish is brown. Baking time is about 1 hour.    ******************************************************  You received this mailer because you subscribed to it.

""Temperatures are forecast to be normal to slightly above-normal through the week in most regions, so we're feeling pretty bearish right  now,"" commented one marketer.  A late-session rally for off peak power was reported at the Mid-Columbia, but most players believed that one or two parties must have been caught a little bit short given the mild weather and abundant supplies.  Heating demand in the WSCC was only expected to average 94 percent of normal through February 11, and the latest six-to-ten-day forecast was calling for mostly normal temperatures from February 10 through 14.  In other industry news, former Enron CEO Ken Lay told Congress on Sunday that he would refuse to testify before two committees preparing to hear his testimony.  As a result, the Senate Commerce Committee cancelled Monday's hearing at which Mr. Lay was to have been the sole witness.  The Senate Commerce Committee said it would meet Tuesday morning to subpoena Mr. Lay.  Senator Byron Dorgan, the North Dakota Democrat who heads the committee's consumer affairs subcommittee, said, ""We decided that we really had no choice but to issue a subpoena to require his attendance.""  Mr. Dorgan said he had been assured by some Republicans on the Commerce Committee that they would vote in favor of a subpoena.  Tuesday's heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell slightly from levels seen for Monday as regional temperatures had begun to moderate.  A late-day rally occurred in the light load arena when some shorts reportedly entered the market.  ""There wasn't a whole lot of activity for the off peak when the session began, but later on it just shot up,"" said one Oregon-based utility trader.  Heating demand in the region was forecast to pick up over the coming weekend, rising to an average of 121 percent of normal next Sunday and Monday.

There were a few goings on in the generation landscape Monday.  Bridger #1 (520 MW) was back in service, but Bridger #3 and #4 (520 MW each) were brought down so engineers could perform some ""boiler unplugging.""  The Wyoming-based units were both expected to return to service sometime on Thursday.  Amid stagnant gas values and slightly below-normal temperatures, power prices settled lower in the Golden State on Monday.  ""I think prices will trend down this week, with the warmer weather,"" commented one California player.  Heavy load goods at NP15 changed hands between 24 and 24.75$/MWh, with unconfirmed trades heard as high as 26$/MWh.  Light load pieces were bought and sold from 19.75 to 21$/MWh.  NP15 Balance-of-February was heard near 23.25$/MWh.  Of hydroelectric interest, the California DWR listed snow-water equivalents in the northern section of the state at 111% of normal.

On the weather front, Tuesday forecasts called for highs to reach 70 degrees in L.A. and 58 to 61 degrees at mid-state load centers.  Overnight lows were anticipated in the mid-30s to mid-40s.  The five-day outlook predicted little change through Friday.  The most current six-to-ten predicted normal temperatures from February 10 to 14.  With Phoenix forecast to see daytime highs in the 70s and overnight lows in the 50s through the week, day-ahead electricity prices headed lower in the Southwest on Monday.  Peak power at Palo Verde ranged from 23 to 24.25$/MWh an average decline of 1$/MWh from levels reported for Monday.  Mead commanded a premium to PV, with several players stating that the higher-priced electricity was bound for the California market.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (395 MW) was operating at 260 megawatts on Monday, but was still having trouble ramping all the way to full power.  Meanwhile, Coronado #2 (385 MW) was scheduled to come down early Tuesday for some planned maintenance slated to last until February 10.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for above-normal temperatures in eastern New Mexico and normal temperatures everywhere else from February 10 through 14.

With the exception of Texas, which tanked on low gas values, heavy load goods changed hands firmly in the 20s everywhere.  Maintenance outages also contributed to the bullish tenor of the day.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures slipped on Monday, with March falling 2.1 cents to close at 2.117$/mmBtu.  April also edged down a comparatively mild 1.4 cents to end at 2.184$/mmBtu.  Amid much stronger load forecasts and colder temperatures expected for Tuesday, heavy load energy costs rose in the Mid-Atlantic on Monday. Western PJM pieces were bought and sold in a narrow range from 24.9 to 25.3$/MWh.  LMPs bounced up and down three times in the late morning and early afternoon on Monday, and averaged 22.38$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  On the generation front, sources gave Keystone #2 (850 MW) a revised expected off-line date of February 8.  The unit was reportedly slated to undergo 20 days of maintenance.  High temperatures were expected in the upper-30s on Tuesday, and predicted in the low-40s by the end of the workweek.  The most current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 10 to 14.  Traders in the Midwest characterized the dailies as a ""wild ride"" on Monday, with heavy load electricity prices strengthening considerably on the aggregate.  ""Cinergy opened near 20, climbed to 22.5, came off, and leapt up all the way to 24$/MWh at the end,"" said one Cinergy commentator on the day after the Super Bowl.  While the dailies changed hands from 20 to 24$/MWh on Monday, market players said the bulk of deals were seen around 21.5$/MWh. Balance-of-February trades were heard between 20.25 and 20.5$/MWh.  In unit news, Quad Cities #2 (789 MW) was off the grid for refueling and pump repairs on Monday, with a tentative ETR of March 11.  Sister unit #1 (821 MW) was in start-up.  Fellow nuke LaSalle (1,144 MW) was also in start-up at 25% late Monday, and expected at full by mid-week.   Temperatures were slightly colder than anticipated by Friday forecasts, with highs across ECAR in the mid-30s and lows in the low-20s.  The outlook called for slight warming, into the low-40s by Thursday, and the latest six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 10 to 14.  The Southeast saw some strength on Monday as daily power prices responded to the colder forecasts.  Into TVA day-ahead peak power prices were heard from 21 to 24$/MWh, with the low end reached late and the bulk of deals done in the 22 to 22.25$/MWh range, according to traders.  Balance contracts into TVA were heard trading between 20 and 20.15$/MWh.  Texas electricity prices weakened on gas, with transactions heard between 18.5 and 19.35$/MWh.  ERCOT balance-of-the-month saw action mostly from 18 to 18.6$/MWh.  Tuesday forecasts called for temperatures well below normal across both regions, with highs expected in the mid-40s.

""Prices were trading in very narrow ranges at most of the hubs today, and that made for a lackluster session,"" complained one marketer.  NYMEX Henry Hub contracts for the front months closed lower on Tuesday despite cold Northeast temperatures, likely due to more moderate forecasts for next week, and on some technical selling.  March slipped 4.3 cents to close at 2.074$/mmBtu, while April shed 3.2 cents to end at 2.152$/mmBtu.  Most 2003 and 2004 contracts finished up slightly.  The EIA recently said that it expects U.S. natural gas inventories to end the first quarter at a record 1.46 tcf.  The low point for U.S. gas stocks at the end of the winter heating season has averaged about 920 bcf over the past eight years.  Weekly draws of 144 bcf would be needed over the nine remaining weeks of withdrawl season to lower inventories to a more normal 1.0 tcf. Not a likely scenario since draws for the nine-week period have averaged 63 bcf over the past five years.  In other industry news, lawyers for Ken Lay have refused to accept a subpoena from a congressional committee requiring his appearance at public hearings.  Mr. Lay's lawyers said they did not know their client's whereabouts and could not accept any subpoenas on his behalf. Peggy Peterson, a spokesperson for the House financial services committee said, ""He [Lay's lawyer] tells us he does not know of Lay's whereabouts, which we find quite puzzling to say the least.  Even if Lay is forced to appear by a subpoena, many parties believe he would likely plead the Fifth and not testify.  Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest were steady to slightly higher than levels reported a day ago.  Amid continuing cold overnight temperatures, light load goods traded slightly higher, and in a narrower range.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were little changed, coming in at 110 kcfs Wednesday and Thursday, 105 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 115 kcfs Monday, and 110 kcfs next Tuesday.  No news was good news on the unit front Tuesday, with no new significant outages reported.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the region was forecast to average 115 percent of normal through February 12, with the greatest demand expected during the latter part of that period.  With little news, close-to-normal temperatures, and steady spot gas prices at the SoCal border, day-ahead electricity prices edged up slightly in the Golden State on Tuesday.  Heavy load transactions at NP15 went through from 24.25 up to 26.25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done in the 24.25 to 24.75$/MWh range and the high end reached late.  Light load goods maintained their recent strength, trading from 20.25 to 21.5$/MWh.  NP15 balance-of-February saw action around 22.75 to 23.25$/MWh.  ""I think some traders had the March jitters, light and heavy firmed up some there today,"" commented one California player.  SP15 off-peak saw the most strength on Tuesday, with deals going through as high as 22.95$/MWh for Wednesday delivery.  There was little change in the generation landscape on Tuesday. Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) returned to service from a maintenance outage that began February 2.  Alamitos #3 (320 MW) ramped up to 240 MW, on its way back from an outage that began January 26.  Forecasts for Wednesday called for highs at southern load centers to reach the mid-60s, down slightly from Tuesday's levels, with overnight lows in the upper-40s.  The state capital anticipated a high of 58 degrees and a low of 36 degrees.  The most current six-to-ten from the NWS predicted normal temperatures from February 11 to 15.  In the Southwest, peak power prices for Tuesday delivery were flat to slightly lower to a day ago as weather conditions in cities such as Phoenix were described as ""beautiful, sunny, and in the 70s.""  Heavy load energy at Palo Verde ranged from 22.5 to 23.5$/MWh, with unconfirmed trades heard as high as 24$/MW.  Mead commanded a premium to PV, but most of that energy was reportedly bound for the Golden State.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (395 MW) returned to full power Tuesday, following tube leak repairs that began back on January 25.  Meanwhile, Coronado #2 (385 MW) slipped into a planned maintenance outage slated to last until February 10.  Weather Derivatives forecast heating demand in the desert region to average a mere 85 percent of normal through February 10, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for mostly normal temperatures from February 11 through 15.

""It was good to see some strength in the dailies, however short-lived it may be,"" said one Cinergy player.  Firmer prices were seen in Balance-of-February and the March/April contracts as well, despite another lackluster day in gas.  NYMEX Henry Hub futures edged down again on Tuesday.  March fell 4.3 cents to close at 2.074$/mmBtu, while April lost 3.2 cents to end at 2.152$/mmBtu.  Amid much higher real-time prices, peak electricity prices edged up just slightly in the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday.  Western PJM goods for Wednesday delivery were bought and sold between 24.75 and 25.75$/MWh.  Traders mostly expected prices to drop off with warmer forecasts for the end of the week. LMPs reached a lofty high of 115$/MWh early Tuesday morning, but averaged 35.09$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  High temperatures were expected to warm into the mid-40s on Wednesday and continue there through Saturday.  The latest six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 11 to 15.  With unit outages and winter weather, heavy load energy costs made robust gains in the Midwest on Tuesday, to the delight of sellers.  ""People have really found their faith today.  Balance-of-Feb was up over a buck and March/April surged a bit as well,"" crowed one trader.  Into Cinergy edged up all day, trading between 22.75 and 26$/MWh, while Balance was heard from 21.1 to 21.35$/MWh and March/April saw action up to 21.25$/MWh.  Power sellers were concerned with the higher transmission rates they were seeing from the newly operating MidwestISO on Tuesday.  ""I'm seeing a base rate of 4$/MWh, and if you add in ancillary costs of 50 cents and recovery of old costs at 2.5$/MWh, transmission is costing nearly 7$/MWh, compared to about 4$/MWh before.  That's going to hamper movement in and out of Cinergy, and increase volatility in the market,"" predicted one in-the-know seller.  In unit news, sources said Beaver Valley #2 (833 MW) has been off-line since February 4.  Traders also said Cook #2 could be back as early as February 16, while the Rockport unit (1,300 MW) was expected to remain down into mid-March.  High temperatures were predicted to warm slightly into the upper-30s for Wednesday, and the most current six-to-ten continued to forecast above-normal temperatures from February 11 to 15.  Bullish weather conditions sent day-ahead electricity prices higher in the Southeast and Texas on Tuesday.  ""I saw some buyers today that have been out of the market for a while,"" commented one SERC player.  Into TVA on-peak pieces traded from 23 to 25$/MWh, with off-peak pieces equally strong from 16 to 19$/MWh.  Unlike northern hubs, Entergy dealers reported a weaker balance-of-the-month market on Tuesday.  Wednesday forecasts called for well below-normal temperatures across SERC and Texas, with highs mostly in the mid-30s to mid-40s.  The mercury was expected to climb into normal territory by Saturday and the up-to-date six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures from February 11 to 15. ___________________________________________________________   California ISO Congestion Index in $/MWh                           Path                 Peak   Off-peak for 06-Feb-02         NW1 to NP15             0.00     0.00                       NW3 to SP15             0.00     0.00                       AZ3 to SP15             0.00    14.00                       LC1 to SP15             0.00     0.00                       SP15 to NP15            0.00     0.00    OTC Forward Peak Electricity Contracts in $/MWh                      Mid-C              PV              SP-15                 Bid      Ask      Bid      Ask      Bid      Ask BOM            18.50    19.50    21.50    22.50    23.25    24.25 March          15.50    17.00    21.00    22.00    22.25    23.25 April          15.75    17.25    22.00    23.00    22.25    23.25 May            15.00    16.50    23.50    24.50      NA       NA Q2 '02         15.50    17.00    24.00    25.00    23.50    24.50 Q3 '02         28.50    30.00    37.50    38.50    36.50    37.50 Q4 '02         27.50    29.00    27.25    28.25    28.50    29.50 Q1 '03         27.25    28.75      NA       NA     30.50    31.50 Cal '03        29.00    30.50    33.25    34.25    35.25    36.25  Represents the most recent bid/ask spread obtainable by the Energy Market Report.

Take a Fan Fare trip from delta.com and explore a city you might not otherwise visit. Whether you're interested in immersing yourself in nature on the slopes, the arts, or history, Salt Lake City is the perfect destination this weekend. Here are a couple of ideas to get you started.  Ballet West Ballet West ranks among the premier professional ballet companies in the United States. The company strives to bring new levels of excellence to ballet through innovative choreography, and to present balanced programs representing a broad range of ballet styles. This weekend you can experience two company premieres, Christopher Bruce's Ghost Dances and Hans van Manen's Black Cake. Concluding the program is George Balanchine's tribute to the great composer Igor Stravinsky, Stravinsky Violin Concerto. Located at Capitol Theatre, 50 West 200 South, Salt Lake City.  Temple Square No trip to Salt Lake City is complete without a long visit to the square that forms the heart of Salt Lake City. You'll find the Family History Library, the Tabernacle, home of the world-famous Mormon Tabernacle Choir, as well as the Temple that gives the square its name. Free tours begin every 5 or 10 minutes at the 100-foot flagpole in the center of this 10-acre block.    <http://www.delta.com/images/spacer.gif>     <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>    <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif> Denver (DEN) to Salt Lake City (SLC) Los Angeles (LAX) to Salt Lake City (SLC) Pasco/Kennewick (PSC) to Salt Lake City (SLC) Portland (PDX) to Salt Lake City (SLC) San Diego (SAN) to Salt Lake City (SLC) San Francisco (SFO) to Salt Lake City (SLC) Seattle (SEA) to Salt Lake City (SLC) Spokane (GEG) to Salt Lake City (SLC)    <http://www.delta.com/images/spacer.gif> $108 $128 $118 $128 $128 $128 $128 $118     <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>    <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif> To see the full list of fares available this week, click GO.    <http://www.delta.com/images/spacer.gif> Go <http://e-mailprograms.delta.com/AC/Clickthru?q=f9-mtNTQxOULW9AuKB2MQn4Mb0ufAvh TARGET=>     <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>    <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>    <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>    <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>    <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>    <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>   <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif> Things to Remember <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/things_to_remember.gif>Return to Top.  <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>    <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>   Begin travel on Saturday, March 9 and return Monday, March 11 or Tuesday, March 12, 2002.

Because of Enron's past association with MetLife, we received a cash distribution and that's what we gave eligible employees.  Employees who were active as of 9-28-99 and on the payroll 9-28-01 received a share of the distribution.
