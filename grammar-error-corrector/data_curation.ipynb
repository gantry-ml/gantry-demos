    "This notebook is designed to demonstrate how to use Gantry to seamlessly transform the production data that is flowing into Gantry into training sets. The goal of datasets and curators is to allow users to tell Gantry _what_ they want, something that requires judgment and domain expertise, and let Gantry take care of the _how_. That includes all the messiness of managing reliable jobs that trans production streams into versioned datasets."

    "- We use `GantryConfig` and `DataStorageConfig` to grab some configurations, like the earliest timestamp of the data which will trigger Gantry to backfill all of the intervals between that date and now\n",
    "- We use the `BoundedRangeCurator` because it makes it easy to specify a curator according the bounds on a field, namely `account_age_days`\n",

    "2. List the versions in the dataset. Each version represents a historical interval (in this case day) of data. Listing the versions makes the relationship between curators and datasets explicit: as curator jobs run, one for each interval, they create versions of a dataset. The versions contain metadata about what fraction of the specified limit is being met, as you can see below in the format: `x records added from interval of size y`"

    "Gantry datasets are a lightweight container for your data with simple versioning semantics that aim to make it straightforward to build more robust ML pipelines. Versioning is at the file level, and centers on two operations: `push` and `pull`. Curators `push` data to Gantry Datasets. Users `pull` data from them to analyze, label, or train on. Users can also make local modifications to datasets, and `push` them back. All `push` operations create a new version, and each version is written to underlying S3 storage. You can read about datasets in more detail in the [Datasets guide](https://docs.gantry.io/docs/datasets).\n",
